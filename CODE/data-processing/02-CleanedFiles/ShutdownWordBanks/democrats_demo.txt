That’s blatantly wrong. The transcript was: >Pelosi: “You don’t have the votes for a border wall.” >Trump: “We need border security...” >Pelosi: “Of course we do.” NO! We don’t. What we have is already more than we’ve ever had. It should literally be at the bottom of the priority list. Immigration reform should be spoken about before we talk about any additional walls, border agents, or anything else.
I feel like Obama's life right now is absolutely the best. He just has to show up in a Christmas hat somewhere and all we say is 'omg look a president who doesn't scream about walls and government shutdowns!' I love how he just tries to give the right example, even if he doesn't really have to. I'm not from America but I really miss the guy. Trump is such a global catastrophy. That man is the biggest manbaby in the world. Obama was a good guy. He made some mistakes like any other person would, but he left a legacy of positivity and reason, sadly much of it has been uprooted by trump and his anti Obama era rules campaign.
Chuck Schumer baited him to own it, this was amazing to play him into his own game, 'the reality star' got played into his own game, lolol
1. You don’t know whether they accepted asylum in Mexico, disappeared into crime underbellies or just plain turned back. 2. I never said building a border wall is a solution. Also how can you possibly get a good idea of how many crimes illegals commit when many are undocumented and unknown to authorities. Also you have not established whether or not the illegals have actually applied for asylum and have been rejected or accepted. This leads me to believe that a) you don’t know the true amount of crimes committed because b) If all of the illegals were actually known to authorities then their claims would be processed in courts to determining asylum eligibility and c) Those who failed would be deported and be charged for entering the US illegally without a valid asylum claim. 
I think they're playing the long game. Dems are just feeling him out right now. &#x200B; I hate the gender bias in what I'm about to say, but I think Chuck Schumer would be better suited in dealing with Trump than Pelosi will.
I said a good idea, their idea of strong opposition to illegal immigration is not only fucking idiotic (They only care about brown skinned illegal immigrants they ignore all others) but it is further so because it's predicated on their complete lack of understanding of our actual immigration laws. Now, our immigration laws ARE a mess that need to be cleaned up - and people should not enter the country illegally. A good idea, as opposed to their white identity politics driven idea, would be to reform both the laws to make them more understandable and accessible while also reforming enforcement to go after employers who knowingly employee unauthorized immigrants - and make the fines meaningful. The latter item would be an actual real enforcement item with teeth, rather than the boondoggles the alt right has proposed they've proposed. Illegal border crossings have also been going down for years:  Visa overstay is the primary issue:  their boondoggle retarded border wall would not even address that, not to mention be ineffective at actually stopping illegal border crossings.
1. Well, they were a few thousand before approaching the US border, and dwindled down a few hundred. So, clearly the majority accepted asylum in Mexico. 2. That is besides the point. The article once again was concerned with illegal immigrants breaking the law \*within\* the US. I state again: '**The probability that an illegal immigrant will commit a crime (OF ANY TYPE) within in The U.S is 11.35%. This is substantially LOWER than the probability of an American-born citizen committing a crime. Therefore, to build a border wall to combat a probabilistic threat of 11.35% is a waste of money and completely unnecessary.'** Further, your opinion once again that '100% of illegals have broken the law\* is in fact not true, and not consistent with the law. Particularly, \*federal law is quite clear that immigrants in the U.S. can request asylum WHETHER OR NOT THEY ENTERED LEGALLY\*.
1. What is the effect on US security of a group of 'migrants' trying to cross another country's border? Further, your repeated claim (which is actually an assumption) of labeling people of the caravan 'migrants' is baseless. The majority of them are actually \*asylum seekers\*. You would have to demonstrate that the \*majority\* are economic migrants as opposed to asylum seekers as defined by US immigration law. You have not done this. 2. Further, you are missing the grand and original point: **The probability that an illegal immigrant will commit a crime (OF ANY TYPE) within in The U.S is 11.35%. This is substantially LOWER than the probability of an American-born citizen committing a crime. Therefore, to build a border wall to combat a probabilistic threat of 11.35% is a waste of money and completely unnecessary.** &#x200B;
The bill literally says nothing about the border wall. It says $5.7B for “border security”. How can anyone earmark $5.7B for something as vague as “boarder security”? That is an insane amount of money. 
Merkley added: “$5 billion is a lot of money. That's 650,000 children attending Head Start. It's 2 million meals a day for a year — for a year for — for seniors. And to spend it on a fourth-century strategy rather than on stuff that actually improves border security is something we're just not going to do.” When asked by host Jonathan Karl to clarify that Democrats would not vote in favor of spending money on the border wall, Merkley said “none.” As it turns out, $5 billion is a lot of money to waste on ~~a wall~~ 'artistically designed steel slats.' 
Funny how he quotes Tucson, AZ as having lower illegal traffic due to his wall. Guess what? THERE IS NO WALL NEAR TUCSON, AZ (it's not even on the fucking border, it's about 2 to 2.5 hours away). You want to get a good look at the border wall? Go down to Hereford, Bisbee, and Nogales. There's no 'Trump wall' down here, just the  (edited out my family members). In fact, there's not just one, there are *two* of them, about 10 feet apart. The numbers he is citing are due to Border Patrol doing the job they're already fucking hired to do. The people crying for a border wall are getting played by the same 'main stream media' that they say lies all the time, and by the idiot currently labeled as president.﻿ 
You make a lot of accusations there with no sources.  for Republicans not letting McGovern speak: Nicholas Fandos; Catie Edmondson (December 27, 2018). 'With No Votes Scheduled, a Government Shutdown Will Greet the Democratic House'. The New York Times Now, do you have enough integrity and accountability to reply back admitting you were wrong? I don’t need nor do you owe me an apology personally. But I would have huge respect for you if you (after researching and verifying if you don’t trust my sources) came back here and either owned up to your bullshit, or called me on my bullshit if you find out I am wrong. And honestly, if you do find that I have misled you or if you find something proving me wrong I will gladly come back and eat crow. I’m hoping you have the integrity to do the same.
A huge part of that money will most likely have to be spent on litigation. 2000 miles of border area is a whole lot of land and a lot of it is privately owned. Trumptards don't really have the capacity to grasp the sheer magnitude of an undertaking like a massive border wall. Even if they raise enough money to build the damn thing, and then let's assume for argument's sake that they do get through the courts and get to the construction phase, who the hell is gonna pay to maintain that eyesore. It'll go the way of our wonderful border fence. That was supposed to be a much simpler project but even that got bogged down and only a few hundred miles of it was ever completed. Someone once said that a wall is a first century solution to a 20th century problem. It's a massive waste in every way imaginable. 
I want to ask this may be a stupid question coming from me: How would a border wall be useless? I just want to make sure I have this argument facts straight. Could you give me a list if it's not too much trouble?
Good thing that Pelosi called him out to his face on his lies in a room full of reporters. Better thing that Schumer got him to stridently admit that he would be totally responsible for any ludicrous and wasteful government shutdown in the same room full of reporters...
This is why democrats are looked at with disdain. **Misinformation or outright bullshit makes you look weak and petty.** I totally agree. Let’s review the timeline shall we? On December 19th the Senate **unanimously passed** their second continuing resolution (since Trump had already flip-flopped on the first), the *Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 695)*, funding the government through February 8, 2019. That same day Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support such a measure, meaning it would pass the House even in the wake of opposition from conservative Republicans. After increasing criticism from conservative media, pundits and political figures, Trump reversed his position again and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding. **The House then passed a version of the continuing resolution on December 20 that added $5 billion for the wall** and $8 billion in disaster aid. However, negotiations in the Senate did not lead to agreement on passage of a continuing resolution that day. Trump's changing position had cause conflict among Senate Republicans who worried that Trump would once again flip-flop in them. When asked by reporters what the way forward was, retiring Tennessee Senator Bob Corker laughed: 'I don't know. Y'all have fun. I'm getting ready to drive to Chattanooga... You can’t make this stuff up.' So the shutdown started December 22 and President Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C. So congress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress. But, in an attempt at coming to a resolution in the last days of the lame duck session, the Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Republican Senator Pat Roberts presiding over the session. The House briefly reconvened as well, with Republican Majority Whip Steve Scalise saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018. Democrats sent Congressman Jim McGovern to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown **that the Senate had already passed, but Republicans refused to let him speak**. In every possible way the shutdown is directly the fault of Trump and the Republicans. This is why republicans are seen as disingenuous, feckless fucks. **The constant misinformation and outright bullshit makes them look like disingenuous, feckless fucks.**
Pop quiz: 1. Which states have the highest levels of illegal immigration? 2. Which states would have their borders “protected” by a border wall? 3. Which states take in more federal money than they contribute? (i.e. welfare states) Here’s a hint: the answers to 1 2 are different than 3. 
Wouldn't be surprised if he decides to not send us back pay out of spite.
And.... >The House passed a stopgap measure Thursday night to fund the government that includes $5 billion for a border wall sought by President Donald Trump. The bill is expected to be rejected in the Senate, and does little to prevent a shutdown on Saturday. 
Can't wait for the Dems to move their things into their new offices. You thought the last two years was exciting? Get ready. If that Pelosi/Schumer meeting was any indicator, and starting with a shutdown. Donald Trump is going to keep the government shutdown until 2020.
It’s also a convenient distraction for Trump losing his border wall funding fight by claiming victory over ISIS. Fortunately, anyone with half a brain can see right through that. Unfortunately, most Trump supporters just don’t meet that simple criteria. Even Putin can see that Trump is screwed, so he’s trying to cash in before Trump is ousted. 
Thank fucking Christ that Republicans see formal education as liberal propaganda and are too stupid to run the government effectively. We’ll get out of this okay. Americans can ignore racism, xenophobia, rudeness and lack of class but they can’t ignore a tanking economy and 3 government shutdowns in a year. 
>After two years surrounded by loyalists and sycophants, Trump had got his first taste of what life will be like with Pelosi in control of one half of Congress. And as the cameras rolled, he quickly lost his cool, declaring he would be “proud to shut down the government”, trapped on live TV by his temper and the pincer movement of Pelosi and the top Democratic senator Chuck Schumer. This is the first time someone is telling him 'no' and he can't get over it. Pelosi isn't here to babysit like Paul Ryan.
Chuck Schumer kinda flupped, but Nancy Pelosi went hard AF. Had my doubts about her as Speaker, but those have been assuaged. Pure class.
That's a shame. I'd be all for a government shutdown if the military got furloughed too.
Yest Democratic lawmakers won't vote Yes on funding the border wall to deny law breakers access across our border.
