"They aren't directly obligated, but they are forced to make a choice. A company can only sell goods and services on the American market if it doesn't violate the rules, and one of those rules is that it can't also be in the Iranian market. Most companies have at least some business in the US market, and it'd be painful to drop the US market entirely in favor of the Iranian market. ",t3_a3lvzs,internationalpolitics
"Whether it's acceptable behavior is not relevant, the fact of the matter remains that the US alone decides the rules for engaging on its market, and this is one of them.",t3_a3lvzs,internationalpolitics

"An assistant general manager of a Turkish state bank is prisoned in US for several years, since an Iranian trader bought oil from Iran sold to Turkey, (brokered Iranian oil export to neighboring Turkey) and converted some amount of gold into USD or USD into gold for payments, using that bank and the Turkish guy was marginally involved in this high profile customer's transactions. So US can ban use of US dollar and its Swift money transfer system for trades with countries that are under his sanctions. And if your bank is used to such kind of things as an officer of that bank you can be arrested in USA. All these transactions happened before 2009, the guy was traveling back and forth usa all the time and he got arrested in 2016.. Turkey and Iran buying and selling oil and US is jailing a Turkish banker for that:  I don't know what happens if Turkey bans trade with country X and an American citizen does trade with the country X and then Turkish police arrests that person when she comes to Turkey. Even Huawei case is less outrageous. US can export it's products to any party, on the condition that it cannot be sold such and such countries and if you import and export to that countries you may have broken a US law that you accepted to obey. And when you're in a place you are under their sovereignty you can be arrested prosecuted. The issue is using international banking system in the similar way in Turkish case. Turkey and other party is put under huge problems to transfer money for another country, based on US dollar being the international currency for trade. A second thing is that the Huawei official is arrested in Canada.. So US can get any person arrested and extradited to so US soil if they have good relations with that countries. Chinese may be pissed to Canada as much as US. The last thing is how this person is selected as the person to be arrested and extradited, are all ordinary Huawei officials in the list? If any of the high profile officials get into US or countries like Canada will they be arrested? Who are really responsible? Or is it a kind of taking the first available high profile person hostage, as a punishment and sanction to Chinese companies? &#x200B;",t3_a3lvzs,internationalpolitics

"*Rules*? You make it sound as if this was normal, accepted behavior. In fact this aggressive US posturing is highly controversial around the world. Forcing the whole world (governments, companies and individuals) to take a side in your stupid conflict with a random country is pretty much unique to the US. It’s arrogant, destructive and in the end endangers even their own interests. Imagine if everyone did this. China has sanctions on Taiwan and the US regularly disregards them but China doesn’t compel other countries to arrest and extradite US managers to try them in Beijing. Normal countries just don’t do stuff like this - it defies all proportionality in terms of the conduct between civilized nations.",t3_a3lvzs,internationalpolitics

"When reading Russian fluff like that we should all remember Russia is a **dwarf** compared to Europe. Russia has: 1/18 of the GDP of the, EU1/5 of the population of the EU and 1/4 of the military spending of the EU. The only thing Russia has is a lot of land that is mostly useless. Even the natural resources of Russia, which were one of it's strenghts, are dropping in price radically. What we see from Russia in the last decade is a desperate attempt to remain relevant, despite it's waning power and horrible domestic policy. The correct thing to do is to not allow Russia to pretend like they are a big player on the world stage, because they aren't. Of course this does not mean that Putin should be allowed to do whatever he wants! Ukraine has shown that a stick and carrot aproach to key Russian allies is a very effective strategy which leaves Putin without proper answers. &#x200B;",t3_a1xqf9,internationalpolitics
