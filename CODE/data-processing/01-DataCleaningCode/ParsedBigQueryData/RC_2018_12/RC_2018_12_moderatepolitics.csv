"This is a major part of why I stopped identifying as right-wing alltogether. The right has taken steps in being more accepting, and I genuinely believe that many right-wingers aren't bigots, but in my opinion, utterly inadequate action has been taken by those non-bigots to disassociate from the loud and proud bigots on the right. Just like the left can be held to task for associating with bad actors, so should the right. And I think the Right's implicit support of a lot of really nasty movements outweighs the fact that progressives are assholes.",t3_a5z582,moderatepolitics

"There's nothing wrong with the system and the SCOTUS justices we have are all pretty good. I suggest you read the article in my links -- or do some research for scholarly law article on the Subject. There are in fact very many good reasons to change SCOTUS, in order to more align with the Founders' intent of de-politicizing SCOTUS. other proposals such as abolishing ICE and the electoral college. ICE is new -- and comparing them with Constitutional changes is absurd. In fact - our Constitution is one of the biggest arguments for abolishing ICE. An unaccountable paramilitary-police organization does not align with our constitution even remotely. We have plenty of agencies handling immigration already, and ICE has shown to be highly unreliable, and far too paramilitary to align with the Constitutional norms and values of our country. EC of today is not what the Constitution intended. It was not meant to be 100% uniform state vote. If you got 55-45 in state, the founders did not envision that translating to 100% EC votes, and the same as getting 90%-10% in that state. In fact - when this sytem started to take over in 1823, Madison immediately sought to Amend the Constitution to reform the EC.  But with all possible abatements the present rule of voting for President by the H. of Reps. is so great a departure from the Republican principle of numerical equality, and even from the federal rule which qualifies the numerical by a State equality, and is so pregnant also with a mischievous tendency in practice, ***that an amendment of the Constitution on this point is justly called for*** by all its considerate best friends.",t3_a9t02b,moderatepolitics

"It seems to me one of the reasons so many companies are running to automation is because of the expense in paying for mandated benefits, and to avoid to be the 'example' company that politicians use as a big company that pays less than 'a living wage'. These companies are spending more money to automate, than it would cost to just pay the people to do the work, because people only seem to get mad if you underpay employees, and don't care if you invest to avoid hiring them. Many of these companies that are automating are not solving any problems that really need to be solved. They are diverting the engineering minds and resources that could be devoted to other projects, into solving the PR and regulatory problems that come with hiring people. The simplest (short term) solution would be to allow the types of people that would be otherwise 'spend 75 percent of their time on the computer playing videogames and surfing porn' to work at their market prices (many of these jobs currently pay under $15 and hour), without shaming the companies for hiring these types of people. No societal problem is solved, when the big retail store in town announces that they now pay employees $15 hour, but accomplished that by firing all their employees that made less than $15 an hour, and replaced them with self checkouts and . Long term, yes, automation is going to continue to come as it has been for the past 100 years. And yes, automation is not just going to change the market place for those making under $15, it will impact the whole market place. The long term game plan isn't easy but is simple. It is for people to be transitioning their knowledge into skills that are in demand. Ideally, college students are picking specialties that are in demand, and look to be in demand for the next 30 years. And people that are working now in jobs that are 'at risk' can be working into transitioning into new skills. I don't think there is anyway around that. I think a universal income is a worthy experiment (maybe on a state scale), but one that I think will ultimately fail. Because too many people will spend 'their time on the computer playing videogames and surfing porn' if they are paid enough to sustain that life-cycle. Ideally, we have a system that encourages as many people with productive potential as possible, to be working at improving the worlds productive output.",t3_a7gmhd,moderatepolitics

"Sure. People file no-contest divorce all the time, even when there is infidelity, in order to avoid the legal expenses and hassle involved. In most cases, even if there is infidelity you can't sue for damages- alimony or palimony is not the same thing. Those are based on the financial circumstances of the couple, what a jury or judge finds fair, etc., which might be influenced by infidelity but it is not a civil punishment- you aren't being fined for adultery, which isn't a criminal act in most modern jurisdictions. Quite different from being restrained from exercising freedom of movement or association because of marriage. For instance, if someone has a non-sexual relationship with someone outside the marriage, a partner might ask the other partner to avoid that person if it is seen as a threat to a marriage. They can not, however, go to a judge and get an injunction preventing a spouse from visiting someone because it might lead to infidelity.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

"I don’t entirely understand the real estate thing either, but I have a friend who works in finance who has tried to explain it to me. I think it is basically used as a way to pay for illegal things. Like- You owe me $200k for some drug trafficking I did for you, you buy a house from me and pay $200k more than it is worth. Real estate is worth whatever someone will pay for it, so it good for that kind of illegal transaction. This is also why art and antiquities are used as currency among criminal organizations. Well this goes back to my original comment with regards to money laundering then. If someone is overpaying for Trump’s property as a way of giving him money for something else - I want to know what he did to illegally earn the extra money? I just did some research, and the articles I found basically said it’s where people who have already laundered their money will invest it, because if they do something else like make a big stock purchase, it might raise interest in where the money came from. Even though the money at that point is clean, someone snooping might realize what’s going on. But if that’s what people were doing - well, there’s no reason they’d have told the seller (Trump) that that’s what they’re doing. They’re just buying property as an investment, why tell anyone you don’t need to tell? Trump also had a bunch of failed casinos- pretty damn good place to launder a bunch of dirty cash! Pretty hard to fail a cash business that has dirty money being laundered through it. You would literally have people showing up with cash and intentionally losing it to the house. Anyway- I know this could be a slippery slope. We can’t just investigate our political opponents until we find something. But in the case of trump, there are just so many indications that he has engaged in fraud for his entire career that I don’t see why he should get a pass just because he is president. At the end of the day- I think his fraud was mostly an open secret- he practically bragged about some of his scams. The voters should have dealt with it in the GOP primaries. Just Trump U alone was a gigantic scam. Running a scam like that should preclude a person from a lot of things, including and especially becoming president. Trump’s entire career has been in the spotlight for his entire life. If it was so “obvious” then why wasn’t it caught before? I’m just rambling now. I just don’t like the idea that a legit criminal could remain in the White House. If Clinton won and it turned out she was actually the criminal her opponents accused her of being, I would want her out of the White House as well. I don’t think it is too much to ask expect a non-criminal President. As of right now, there is absolutely no reason to believe he’s a “legit criminal.” He might be, but he’s been in office 2 years and there has been no information made public indicating that he is. The closest thing is the hush money. And let’s be honest, people only give a fuck about that because it’s trump.

">There was never any evidence that Trump was working with Russia to win the election. Not true. There is overwhelming evidence that numerous members of the Trump campaign conspired to seek and accept help from representatives of the Russian government to help Trump get elected.

That person explained how the Russian government could provide the Trump campaign with 'political synergy' and 'synergy on a government level' and offered to setup a meeting between Trump (then a Republican nominee) and Putin.

Also incorrect. By not disclosing to the American public that he was negotiating to build a tower in an adversarial country with whom he made numerous mysteriously deferential comments, he defrauded the electorate.

"What we should do is raise girls with the same encouragement toward STEM fields as we do with boys. While the at par wage gap does not exist, according to this study, you are correct in assuming this does not mean there is no problem. The problem is that women overwhelmingly choose low-income college degrees, which leads to the idea of a pay gap (not to mention some of the pay gap statistics include stay at home women, which unfairly skews the data toward a larger pay gap). Why do they overwhelmingly choose degrees that either lead to poor job prospectives? My guess is it's the home in which they are raised—although in urban homes this may be changing, girls are still raised to be 'girls' and boys are still raised to be 'boys,' with the implication that tech, science, computers, tinkering with electronics, etc. are boyish hobbies that girls should not engage in. If we want more girls taking higher-paying degrees and more girls in tech/STEM fields (higher-paying ones), we need to raise them thinking that it is fine for them to be in these fields. I know I don't have evidence on that last bit, as it's conjecture, but I do think pointing fingers at employers or colleges is not going to fix the issue, merely cover up the symptoms.

There’s a lot of controversy about that case, but a few facts are relatively undisputed: Zimmerman acted against advice from 911 to follow Martin; this action enabled a confrontation to occur that would not have otherwise; a confrontation occurred; Martin was shot and killed by Zimmerman; Zimmerman claimed self-defense successfully. Now, rewind this to Zimmerman in his car, then imagine two things. Imagine first that Zimmerman is not a complete dumbass. (Which for me is difficult, but opinions vary.) And also imagine he knows that the law says he has the burden of proof if he kills in self-defense. Does he get out of the car?

The problem I have with, say, the way the EPA works, is that a company can pollute to save half a million dollars, and they get a few thousand dollar fine. That's nothing. From a business perspective, this makes polluting profitable. Meanwhile, someone trying to build a handicapped accessable home is told they can't because of a bird which may be on their land, but which no one has ever seen.

"Your 'legal conundrums' really aren't. If they're 'deaths in terms of biology,' then they're deaths, period. Abortions should be banned, yes. This is a logical conclusion of 'life begins at conception,' which is itself a logical biological conclusion. Care for ectopic pregnancies should not be banned... 'How can this be,' you ask, 'if that requires an abortion?' It doesn't require an abortion. We aren't consequentialists. In any illness involving a pregnant mother, you provide medical care for both the mother and the child; if in the course of care for the mother (e.g. for an ectopic pregnancy) where a diseased organ is removed and the child dies, this isn't an abortion as the death of the child isn't intended. This isn't a case of 'self defense' because, again, we're not consequentialist. The baby isn't out to 'kill' the mother. The cause of death for either mother or child would be the presence of a diseased organ. There's a clear distinction to be made between abortion (where the death of the child is clearly intended) and unfortunate but necessary medical procedures (where the death of the child is not intended) where the death of either mother or child could result (e.g. a mother may chose to forego chemotherapy to save her child, should this be ruled a suicide 'for which the law should remain indifferent?'

"Happy to help. I try to explain things like this simply because I know not everyone plays games, but at the same time it's very important for them to understand it, especially so if they have children that do play games. &#x200B; In regards to your mention of the courts finding them to be gambling.. That's largely the opinion that game companies have used to defend the practice. The in game virtual items largely have no monetary value. When you put an outfit in a shop at a fixed price, virtual or not, all of a sudden it now has a monetary value at whatever it's price is fixed. &#x200B; However, loot boxes have %'s so that 1% ultra rare monster has no value on it because a value was never assigned. You also aren't gaining any monetary investment as you can't sell or trade them. Most games are quickly doing away with trading systems simply because of that. If you can't trade to get what you want, you must pay for it or grind for it. When you take a mobile game, say Summoner's war for example, you can pay for extra summon scrolls to get the monster you want to be able to fuse into the larger monster you are trying to create. Given that the game has an energy system, you can only grind dungeons and get so many scrolls a day without paying. After that, you are locked from playing the game to get what you want. You can, of course, always buy more energy...Or you can just buy more scrolls. You also cannot trade the monsters you get with people either. &#x200B; While it may not necessarily classify as gambling per legal definition, to me it's gambling by it's truest sense.

"How are you only paying $1527 per year on healthcare/insurance? Is that just the cost of your co-pays in an employer-provided health insurance program? With the skyrocketing cost of health care/insurance in this country, it is now very common for employers to charge co-pays and higher deductibles to help pay for company-provided heath insurance. If you are paying $1500 per year on co-pays and deductibles in an employer-based heath insurance plan, your employer is likely paying multiples of that amount to pay for most of the cost of your health insurance. In this case, your heath insurance cost is not just the amount that you are spending on co-pays, plus also the amount that your employer is paying towards your health insurance coverage. If your health insurance coverage costs $500 per month, and you are only paying $125 of that cost, your employer is paying the other $375 per month. Your total cost is actually $1500+the amount that your employer pays towards your your heath insurance coverage, which your employer is reducing your salary/wages to pay for. As for the tax increases required to fund a national health insurance system, the assertion that it would require an additional 10% tax on your gross income is completely ridiculous, unless you are in the highest income brackets. The median household income in the United States in 2018 is a little over $62,000. If we use this median income as an example, the maximum federal income tax for a single person making $62k in 2018, with no tax deductions other than the standard single person exemption, would be $6934. If this median household example was a married couple, with no tax deductions other than the standard exemption, their federal tax income tax would be $4182. The average middle class American is currently paying around 10% of their gross income in federal income taxes. The assertion that their federal tax payments would have to double to pay for a national heath insurance program is ridiculous. ",t3_a2wuos,moderatepolitics

"There is no child. A child is a young person. A person is an individual. There are no individuals in this case other than the woman and the donator of the sperm. There is a fertilized egg and then a fetus which is so not an individual that just the act of seperating it from another individual results in it's cell death. It is repulsive to think of it in these terms but we are talking about a parasitic relationship until the fetus is viable If humans were chickens and transformed from fertilized egg to individual outside of a host, then the egg would still not be a child (or a chick) but I would agree with your preferences that both the chicken and the rooster have the right to protect and maintain the egg. However, since we aren't chickens and the fetus must be grown inside a woman at great expense, physical risk, discomfort, and lifetime implications, and since denying anyone bodily autonomy is a terrifying thought, asserting the rights of the potential father over the needs and decision of the woman is outrageous. Also, In this context, I am referring to a woman unwilling to host a fetus, not to rape.

"First off, these large corporate ceos don’t get paid in salary. They are paid with equity (stocks). So the better they do for the company the more they make as the stocks go up. Their compensation doesn’t come from revenue. It ore or less comes from shareholders because when a CEO is issued new stocks, it increases supply and thus the price of the stock is hit. In terms of wages, even if you took a CEOs entire stock option and cashed it out and gave it back to the drivers, it would practically be nothing. They may get a few hundred extra dollars through the year at best. In the big picture of thing, their compensation has little impact on wages. Also these drivers choose to do this as a job. If the job wasn’t worth it then they can do something else. That’s what determines wage growth. Companies pay higher wages only when it’s needed to retain employees. If an employee can find a better job elsewhere then the company has to raise wages or experience higher turnover. They do the math to determine what’s best. As the economy does better, companies want to hire and grow. As unemployment shrinks that means demand for labor goes up, which means companies will slowly begin having to raise wages to retain talent. The issue with low wage growth in America has little to do with executive compensation. It’s bad optics, but not a problem. There are other issues at play, most in part due to right to work legislation, regulatory capture, wage collusion, and low economic velocity. ",t3_a3ezjy,moderatepolitics

Considering he paid the money back before the story even came out...no I just don't care. Is it worthy of the same treatment Clinton got? Sure.

As far as I can tell, the proposed bill incentives candidates to refuse PAC money by making small-dollar donations and individual contributions a much more viable fundraising strategy. There's no reason that Congress couldn't prohibit vehicles for independent expenditure (IE) campaigns and dark money like Super PACs, but it doesn't appear that's the proposal here.

Only if society were to reject its responsibility would the baby cease to be viable. However, back to legal terms, if society did reject that responsibility, and it took the minimal necessary steps to change the wording of the law, abandoning the baby to die would no longer be murder.

They’re also moving to install one of their own as head of the state Republican Party. The efforts wouldn’t stop a moderate Republican like John Kasich from taking on Trump. But they are designed to shield the president from the kind of damage that a serious primary fight could do to him heading into the general election. An endorsement would provide much more than just a verbal statement of support: It would enable the New Hampshire Republican Party to throw the weight of its entire apparatus behind Trump against any GOP rival. A top strategist to Kasich said the attempt to stack the deck for the incumbent will have no bearing on whether the outgoing Ohio governor decides to run, or on his ultimate success given the significant bloc of independent voters there. As both major parties struggle with virulent uncontrolled trends towards increasingly extremist rhetoric and behavior, I feel Kasich has great potential among both the disaffected and moderates, especially for reason of the relative composure and aura of kindness and dignity he impressively managed to maintain throughout the 2016 Republican primary debates.

In response, the Democrat majority in the legislature stripped as much power as possible from the LT Governor, culminating in the removal of the ability to appoint members to 95 state committees.

"Not liking the way he argues is fine and obviously there is bias inherent in the video, but it seems like you take that bias to the point where you are seeing things that aren’t there, and ignoring what is when convenient.

And then when you were talking about the point where “he realizes he’s gotten under her skin.” What facial expression? His face barely twitches? It seems like you’re just seeing what you want to see. Personally I think that was just the moment he realized this interview was going to go South, because that’s exactly what I saw.

"I don't actually agree that Obama was especially partisan. He was a Democrat, sure, but a pretty moderate one. The reason 'Hope and Change' didn't go as smoothly as it might have was that he was *too* hopeful that Republicans would be willing to, eventually, sit down to talk and do the actual policy work that would result in change. And they simply weren't. They made it their mission to obstruct everything they possibly could, openly and unashamedly. A defining moment you might pick out was when Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Garland was the very guy Republicans put out there as an example of the sort of judge Obama was too partisan to ever nominate. So Obama made good of his 'they go low, we go high' rhetoric with that bipartisan gesture. And well, you know how the Republican-controlled Congress reacted to that. Now, as Trump has demonstrated, the President does have real political power. He can't fire congressmen but he can put on the pressure if he wants to. He can throw a fit and fuck things up. Yet when faced with a Congress *literally refusing to do their jobs for a full year*, in an open attempt to *steal* a Supreme Court seat *simply because they could*, Obama never resorted to any of that, not even rhetorically. Because he was *that* determined to keep (or at this point, reestablish) a calm, productive political climate. So no, I simply don't agree. He was one of the most moderate presidents in recent history. And for every single time a Republican politician cried 'why won't you work with us?' Obama had a reasoned, well-thought-out answer. The answer just never made it onto Fox News, so a good portion of the public never knew what the deal really was, only that 'Obama keeps saying no.' Not to say that Fox News is the problem. The other mainstream outlets didn't exactly do a great job of reporting anything of importance. Things like balancing the budget, discussions over long term vs short term deficits, the fallout from the recession and the ongoing cost of Bush's wars and so on. You know, all the boring details that politics is actually made of, they don't generate clicks, they don't catch the viewer's attention... and fact-checking, oh boy, ain't nobody got time for that. The problem at the end of the day is misinformation, and Fox contributed their fair share, but all the news outlets have been failing spectacularly since about 2000. All while Facebook and Twitter and reddit and other social media sites, even Google with personalized search results and so on, created all these filter bubbles to exacerbate the problem. And then you end up in a fucked up world where the public mostly loves the ACA and mostly hates Obamacare, and people feel entitled to differing opinions on the most basic, verifiable facts.

"So this causes a bit of a tricky situation. Companies should be able to deal with whoever they want some people claim. Going that route, it means that they should be able to discriminate based on whatever they want to some people. We have limits though, if I'm not mistaken, as you can't refuse service to someone because they're black, disabled etc based on the civil rights act of 1964 which designates protected classes according to this article. The entire point of the first amendment is that people are discriminatory and they are allowed to be as long as it isn't something *immutable* and when the government has a history of reinforcing this discrimination like ethnic or sexual discrimination, *or* when a large class of individuals can show that they are basically a second tier class of society, like disabled people. I see no proof *whatsoever* that certain people, for their personal views, are excluded from buying things, going to certain places, or seeking employment. What I *do* see is people who want to express themselves on platforms with large audiences and the owners of those platforms not being comfortable with what they are saying. So, no, I don't think there is an issue with the exact issue you're discussing.

You MIGHT find that politicians and humans of all political parties have the same flaws, thus (by your reasoning) anyone who supports the Democrat Party is guilty of the same behavior you seem to think is limited to Republican supporters. It would be great if that were true, the existence of a political party without corruption and a drive for power, but unfortunately that won't happen when humans make up the membership of the party.

"Last week the nation witnessed a courtroom spectacle that included the president's former personal lawyer and 'fixer,' Michael Cohen, groveling for mercy at a sentencing hearing while his daughter watched, a crutch at her side. Future historians might view the maudlin scene as the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency. The circumstances surrounding Cohen's guilty pleas suggest that special counsel Robert Mueller and Southern District of New York federal prosecutors believe Cohen and Trump broke the law in paying hush money to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels. The clear purpose was to protect the president's reputation as a political candidate. It is even possible that the president already has been indicted by a federal grand jury in a secret, sealed indictment that will be revealed only when he leaves the presidency. Of course, this is necessarily speculative, as prosecutors seal indictments to keep them secret. Prosecutors generally use sealed indictments in three situations. The first is when they fear a suspect, upon hearing of his indictment, might destroy evidence before his arrest. The second is when they fear the suspect might flee. Neither of those applies to Trump. Even though he has the use of two well-equipped planes (Air Force One Trump Force One), he is unlikely to flee the US and has no place to hide. But the third reason could be a factor: when the statute of limitations might expire before the suspect can be arraigned on the indictment.",t3_a737yo,moderatepolitics

At every step of her remarkable rise in the legal profession, the people responsible for hiring her saw her as a white woman. The Globe examined hundreds of documents, many of them never before available, and reached out to all 52 of the law professors who are still living and were eligible to be in that Pound Hall room at Harvard Law School.

"Well worth the read. Even if you don’t like the guys solutions, he seriously discusses some issues that need to be addressed right now. What I’m most concerned about is the trends we’ve seen of the automation of four million manufacturing jobs in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. When that gets applied to retail workers and truck drivers and fast food workers, which are some of the most common jobs in the U.S. economy, we’ll witness a continued disintegration of American society, which we can see in the numbers right now. He sure doesn’t sugar coat either, LOL: The data shows that women who are out of work get involved in the community and go back to school and do things that are quite productive and pro-social. Whereas, men who are out of work spend 75 percent of their time on the computer playing videogames and surfing porn—and then tend to devolve into substance abuse and self-destructive behaviors. Men who are out of work volunteer less than employed men, even though they have more time. And so, men and women seem to experience idleness differently. Automation is not just taking unskilled blue collar jobs anymore either. Our dispatch center will be gone within 2 years - 12 white collar jobs disappeared.

Yet, at that time he also led his opponents among those who are religious. Curiously, Trump is especially popular among white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly believed that he would do a far better job than Clinton on every issue. This is from  regarding a Pew Poll. While 77% of evangelists may have voted for him, that doesn't mean that a majority of his supporters were evangelists. In fact, most of his supporters were atheists or religious people that didn't attend church much. But yes, after the primary, most of the Christian right got behind him.

"If the investigation shows some actual evidence, that will be something to consider. But a lot depends on what the evidence actually is. I'm old enough to have been around during the Clinton impeachment. There's no doubt that Clinton was guilty of the charge against him (perjury) and the republicans had proof in the form of a certain blue dress with... genetic material that proved that he did have something resembling 'sex with that woman'. But would I have voted for his impeachment? No. No I wouldn't. Because while it was technically a crime, and Clinton was guilty, it should not have been impeachable - the constitution is deliberately vague on the concept of 'high crimes and misdemeanors'. If Mueller proves that Trump is really a KGB agent, yeah, that would be an impeachable offense. If OTOH Trump is technically guilty of campaign finance violations by paying off former lovers/whores, that's not. Probably 80 percent of 20th century presidents have had mistresses of some type, most while in office. I'd point out that basically at this point the only way that Mueller comes forward with evidence of a Russia connection is if Trump essentially is the *only one* who interfaced with the Russians. None of the people in his campaign have been charged with any contact with Russia or accepting any help or even anything remotely connected to Russia. So you'll have me believe what, that Trump is this super competent plotter who is a Russian agent? Yeah good luck with waiting on that Mueller proof. I would be shocked at the idea that Trump could keep his big mouth shut for more than a week if he were the member of some kind of Russian conspiracy - he brags faster than his mind can work, and apparently shoots his mouth off at the slightest opportunity.

His mom gave him gave him a slap on the ass and told him to knock it off. He responded by throwing himself on the floor, screaming, and acting injured even though he was fine. He said that at the time, he was pissed at his mom and wanted to get her in trouble. Luckily for him, it was the 80s, and no one cared. As an adult, he realizes just how badly it could have gone for him and his family. Abuse should always be reported.

"Actually it's not. If you just go by pure dollars then yes it increases, but so does everything else. The true measure is how much you spend as compared to GDP and our military spending keeps going down, down, and down. It's in fact the only real government budget program that actually continues to become a smaller and smaller part of the budget. For example entitlements are between 66 and 75% of all budgetary spending and they continue to consume more and more of the budget. The other 1/3rd is roughly everything we run our country with, and out of that 1/3rd, half of that is used on defense. Every 3 to 4 months we spend the entire military budget on entitlements. We borrow like 500 billion a year, defense spending is around 600 billion. You can cut it to zero and we're still bleeding money. Defense works on a budget that needs to be approved, and as the pie shrinks so does their portion of the pie. Entitlement programs are forever, they aren't budgeted, and have mandatory increases every year. Before anyone starts planning a budget upwards of 75% of it has already been pre allocated....within the next 20 years entitlements will exceed 100 % of GDP, and that's if we never ever spend another dime on defense in that time span. The arguement that defense is the only thing bringing our budget down is a myth. It's ignoring the massive elephant in the room no one is talking about. ",t3_a8b3jg,moderatepolitics

Apart from already being a well-walled border, stricter immigration activities has led to more illegal immigrants being stuck in America (counterintuitive, but there used to be a flow of immigrants who came in, worked, then left—unlike what Trump might have folks think, they don't all want to stay in America—but when Obama increased security, more immigrants remained in the US since it was more difficult to get out). The reason many of us democrats don't really care about increased border security is that it doesn't accomplish much (i.e. what's the purpose). The immigration problem is a scapegoating tactic used to dodge more serious or pressing issues, such as the crime of US citizens (which invariable boils down to better living conditions, healthcare, etc.—things one party is vehemently against).

"What we have is the information that Trump wanted to build a Trump tower in Moscow, which we also knew well before we elected him. As for Deutsche bank, that's like saying 'Bank of America laundered money, therefore anyone who has a BoA checking account must be guilty of a felony'. wrt Don Jr, what we know about this gal is that she did this to numerous people on the hill - she'd say whatever to get an interview, then go on and on about the Magnetinski act. My source for this is Matt Taibbi, who has an extensive background in Russia and is also a pretty leftish journalist: [About meeting with Veselnitskaya] >The interview was off the record, so I can’t say much about it, except to say that my experience was weirdly similar to the account Trump Jr. offered about his meeting with Veselnitskaya. >I went into the meeting expecting a scoop on another topic, and instead found myself essentially being lobbied about the Magnitsky Act. I came away scratching my head about the Prevezon crew, unsure of whether they represented high-ranking Russian interests, or were instead just a bunch of provincial amateurs trying to get a sanctions regime lifted in order to unfreeze their assets. >According to The Hill, others who ran into Veselnitskaya recently came away wondering the same thing: >“The sources also described their interactions with Veselnitskaya in the same way that Trump Jr. did. They claimed not to know who she worked for or what her motives were. ‘Natalia didn’t speak a word of English,’ said one source. “Don’t let anyone tell you this was a sophisticated lobbying effort. It was the least professional campaign I’ve ever seen. If she’s the cream of the Moscow intelligence community then we have nothing to worry about.'” >Though Veselnitskaya seems like a small-timer – and Leonid Bershidsky’s excellent background report on her for Bloomberg makes her seem like the equivalent of a third-rate lawyer for the Staten Island Borough president – one never knows with this story. After all, the Trumps themselves aren’t exactly sophisticates, and they live in the White House.  If V was a covert KGB representative for the Russian Government, apparently the Russian government's top item is repeal of the Magnetnski act, which itself is pretty bizarre. More to the point, it would be fairly simple for Trump to have gotten it repealed. Yet he hasn't. Nor has he done anything else which smells like a quid-pro-quo vis-à-vis Russia. I'm not familiar with this 'Trump sitting in on the meeting' thing - which meeting was this? IN any case none of the vast amount of dredging that has been done has pulled up anything that I'd call evidence. It's found a few pretty spurious connections e.g. Veselnitska, but given that seemingly every journalist in the country has been pursuing leads with intensity on this story for two years, any story would have accumulated a number of false positives by now. The thing is that none of these really hold together. ",t3_a82sk7,moderatepolitics

As for *viability* being vague for you, I'll try to explain. Viable means a baby born prematurely (and baby does mean *born*, as in, outside the mother) has some change of living to the point where it doesn't need constant artificial life support, e.g., incubators. 50% chance would make most sense to me, 25% chance wouldn't be unreasonable. I realize those odds are getting earlier in pregnancy given progress in medical technology, but it won't be any time soon that 14 weeks would be viable. claim that any time a child dies pre-term, it somehow qualifies as abortion? No. What I'm citing is evidence that there are many causes for fertilized ova not to result in live births other than abortion. My intent is to illustrate that fertilization, or conception, alone is insufficient to establish a practical concept of life. Characterizes children in the womb as somehow capable and guilty of 'assault' No. Intention isn't necessary to pose mortal risk to others. Only a fool (you perhaps?) could believe a fertilized ovum would have any agency with respect to where it implants. Accidents happen, and ectopic pregnancies are accidents. Nevertheless, they pose serious mortal risk to both mother and fetus, and in those cases where it'd be impossible for such pregnancies to result in live births but near certainty that continuation of such pregnancies would result in the mother's death, then I believe the mother would have the right to protect her own life by terminating the pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are not malfunctions in organs any more than broken bones or severe lacerations are failures in organs. They are accidents which occur infrequently but at a predictable rate across the population of pregnant women due to the fact that women's bodies do not guarantee all pregnancies result in live births. The woman's body per se is not malfunctioning, but allowing placenta and fetus to continue growing would cause death. IOW, it's the fetus and placenta which pose the danger to the woman, not the woman's organs, and that danger involves no more intention than rock slides or lightning bolts.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

"Couple things. First let me answer your question. I think pretty much any Republican would be worse. Republicans, by and large, get their success from the adage 'tried and true, it worked before, it will work again.' This lacks the forward thinking I'd like to see in my government. Note I use the word forward, as progressive has been co-opted by a party that seems to have yielded the bridge to post modern Marxist radicals. There's plenty wrong with Republicans and the Republican party and I see Trump as a compromise between a Republican candidate (which I do not want) and a Democratic candidate (which I do not want). Both parties are steeped in corruption and for years and years now I've been complaining that we do not elect leaders, we elect politicians. No, I absolutely do not want another career politician. Would I like a leader who's also somewhat good at politics? Yes. The problem is, career politicians only APPEAR as if they'd do a good job in office. They don't actually do a good job. Clinton's reign was disastrous, full of errors that emboldened the Taliban and helped set the stage for the rise of ISIS, and Bush Jr made serious mistakes listening to Donald Rumsfeld and let's face it, without the war do you think he'd have had even the mediocre approval ratings he had? I don't. The Republican base has largely lost faith in the political system as it stands, being run by these two parties who no longer represent the people. Hence Trump... not a professional politician. Not the best choice, but hey, it's and Alpha.... the Beta might be better. Maybe we'll be ready for release by 2028. On to Trump acting worse than your son. Your son acts like a child all the time because he's a child. Trump acts like an adult 90% of the time because he's an adult. Yes he acts out, insults people, all that but claiming your son NEVER does that... really? He does, then the checks and balances system adjusts his behavior. Trump insulted Kelly what's her name, then the checks and balances kicked in and he made peace with her. I appreciate what you intend to say, which is that he occasionally acts out in a way that a parent would discipline their child for. The issue I have is that we have this tendency on the left to make a comparison or analogy and then conflate it, and conflate it and conflate it, 'no it's not that, it's that he IS a child' and then the next person comes along and goes further until you have an untenable statement that the opposing team can easily pick apart. Stop it. Say reasonable things. Trumps outbursts are spoiled child like. Done. No need to go further. Additionally, of course he cares about the truth. If Trump could be right all the time he would be. He's simply not. He's prone to reckless exaggeration and only a passing understanding of some things. I do not believe he's deliberately lying or living in an imaginary world. He's simply wrong. You may say that this is worse, but I remind you that professional politicians are often in the same boat, they're just practiced at hiding it. What we're seeing with Trump is behind the curtain. Imagine if Hilary were elected but forced by a machine to tweet out all her thoughts and occasionally blurt them out in front of a mic. This is what we're seeing. Would we think her stupid? Probably the left would be far more lenient and the right would be completely convinced that no one has any excuse to support her anymore. I think Trump is a necessary thing.

If you wish to accuse them of conspiracy to commit a crime of taking information as a campaign contribution you have to prove they weren't willing to pay cash for the information as the Clinton and Bush campaign did with Steele. 3. *This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.* Rob Goldstein saying this is not evidence that they knew she worked for the Russian government. Rob Goldstein didn't say this woman worked for the Russian government. If you wish to claim the Trump campaign knew she was a Russian agent (which in itself hasn't been proven) you need to show proof. Summary * we are unaware of 99%+ of the meetings Trump and Clinton's campaigns had. That isn't proof they were trying to hide anything * you proved its illegal to accept a campaign contribution from a foreigner but have provided zero proof Trumps campaign accepted a campaign contribution from a foreigner not proof they conspired to accept information without reimbursing the foreigner who is providing information with cash aka Steele and the Clinton/Bush campaigns. * I don't need to cite sources when asking you for proof. You are the one claiming something happened. Also your sources are garbage because they don't prove what you are claiming. None of them prove trump took or was attempting to take a campaign contribution from a foreigner and none of them prove Trumps campaign knew she was an official representative of the Russian government (just that rod Goldstein felt Russia's people and gov supported trump)",t3_aatejt,moderatepolitics

">The way I see it is you could either have the governments invest directly into social welfare in the form of education, health care, housing or food... Of the four services mentioned: The government can only directly invest into a targeted community with education, in the form the construction/improvement of the community’s public schools system. How does the government provide direct improvement to healthcare, housing, food, etc. for these communities, when locally, there is a limited availability of substandard options? I think that you may have just assumed that all of these communities tagged as “opportunity zones” are of such low-socio economic status, that there is a significant portion of their population that is dependent social programs like Medicaid, government housing, etc. But the reality is (as far as I understand) these opportunity zones are not as downtrodden as one may assume, and many are simply in need of local economic turnaround and were selected because they showed the potential to benefit from new development (as the article states) or you could dangle a tax break in front of the wealthy over some convoluted “opportunity zone” program and leave the control for wealthy individuals to decide how to help those lower class areas. The “wealthy individuals” are not being tasked with the sole responsibility of helping lower class areas; it would be safe to assume that they are real estate investors and individual developers that are given a tax incentive to expand into an area to provide products/services/housing/business space in an attempt to capitalize on a market of consumers (as well as small businesses) that otherwise would not have had the opportunity or access to do so locally, with the added benefit of providing employment opportunities among the local population, as well as generating tax revenue for the local government.

Real estate is worth whatever someone will pay for it, so it good for that kind of illegal transaction. This is also why art and antiquities are used as currency among criminal organizations. Trump also had a bunch of failed casinos- pretty damn good place to launder a bunch of dirty cash! Anyway- I know this could be a slippery slope. We can’t just investigate our political opponents until we find something. But in the case of trump, there are just so many indications that he has engaged in fraud for his entire career that I don’t see why he should get a pass just because he is president. At the end of the day- I think his fraud was mostly an open secret- he practically bragged about some of his scams. The voters *should* have dealt with it in the GOP primaries. Just Trump U alone was a gigantic scam. Running a scam like that *should* preclude a person from a lot of things, including and especially becoming president. I’m just rambling now.

Besides, most judges are conservative at this time. Like direct campaign contributions by corporations and individuals, direct donations by labor unions are capped. You could perhaps make the case that by favoring small-dollar fundraising Democrats are stacking the deck in their favor, but it's hard to argue that it's smart politics and returns a measure of political power to people who are not corporations.

"The *human* part is unavoidable and not in dispute. The genes are human genes, so the zygote would be a human zygote. The question is whether a zygote is ***life***. That becomes a matter of definition. A fertilized ovum which doesn't implant on the uterine wall is life in the most inclusive sense: capable of cell division. However, it's not viable for obvious reasons, that is, it has zero probability of becoming a live-born baby. Likewise, fetuses with certain irregularities will not survive for even 1 day after birth. Are those fetuses life? More so than a zygote, but not viable in any meaningful way. I could see defining life beginning at viability, where viability is a statistical concept, and certainty increases with time. A fetus at 9 weeks isn't viable. A fetus at 28 weeks is viable given current medical technology. The practical point is the ***legal*** definition of life. The biological fact of some fertilized ova failing to implant on uterine walls makes legally defining life as beginning at conception a logical absurdity. A legal definition needs sufficient conditions, and mere conception isn't a sufficient condition.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

And the subtext of these indirect answers about “the people” is a pretty direct answer: No, obviously Senate Republicans aren’t going to do anything with this, and Democrats will hold that against them in the 2020 campaign. McConnell, in a Wall Street Journal interview Monday night, confirmed that he wants nothing to do with the bill, putting it in the bucket of measures House Democrats would try to pass “knowing full well that I’m not going to take them up.” H.R. 1, he said, is “not going to go anywhere in the Senate.” Pelosi had been anticipating this. “Democrats ran and won a resounding victory in part on our commitment to restore integrity in Washington,” Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, told me. “We are more than happy to make the issue too hot to handle for those who try to obstruct the clear will of the people.” **C-SPAN:** ",t3_a8upzj,moderatepolitics

The 2 major issues people look at are: 1) what type of market do they exist in (Can I sell the item obtained?). This is important as the value of the item obtained is not assigned by the developer, but by the market community and may even appreciate in value. 2) what impact do they have on the game (pay to win vs. cosmetic). Loot boxes that offer items that alter gameplay/stats etc create a pay to win atmosphere. By this nature, players are encouraged or even arguably forced to purchase these if they wish to remain competitive. &#x200B; It's the combination of both fixed market and gameplay altering lootboxes that are of the main focus of being predatory. Not only are you encouraged to purchase to remain competitive, the item(s) obtained are random set by the developer, and also cannot redeem any value stepping away from the game. Let me hit on that second one again. There are NO regulations set as to what the developer has to produce. And unlike physical MTG cards that often (not always) market what type of rarities exist, are pre-printed, and their contents are subject to anyone purchasing; digital reward algorithms can be changed at any time. Hell, they can reward a high profile YTuber with ultra rare rewards for marketing purposes under the guise of it all being equal and no one would be non-the-wiser. They can scan your inventory purposely giving you items you already have. They can look at your purchase history and tailor your reward. Give you a few nice rewards for the first 2 purchased, then tank your odds. The point here it is unregulated. ",t3_a2jxrb,moderatepolitics

">I see racism as a disability, often co-morbid with poverty, and that the most vile and pernicious racism often flows from privileged people who only believe that racism exists in a mythologized class of *other* that they share fantasies of themselves engaged in heroic battles against. Racism rarely looks like the caricatures depicted on television news, and quite often like the person we see in the mirror. This is genius. I've always thought this but never lingered on it long enough to formulate it in a structured way like this. I grew up in Alabama and I (a jew) and 3 friends of mine (muslims) went to California and I had never seen such bigotry in my life. They treated Malik as if he was an imbecile even though he has a scholarship to Caltech. They treated me as if I was evil when I served pizza at a dinner party with pepperoni... we are both not practicing so who gives a shit if it's not Halal. They left their scholarships as did I and moved back to Alabama. I've never visited LA since. As for what the rest of your answers I am on your side as well. People hear a thing of my accent and immediately treated me like I'm this horrible uneducated redneck so when I moved to Germany to study abroad I worked 30 min a day to get rid of my accent. It was never the supposed evil racist antisemitic right that treated me with contempt. It was always the illiberal authoritarian left. I've even met many supposed racists in Albany NY. One day I went to a large cookout with bikers and Pols and Russians and I saw one black family. They were the Harrisons. Thier little girl got called a N***** by one of the little boys cause he heard his dad say it while playing cards. His dad beat his ass raw and made him hold that little girls hand and introduce her to every single person at that party and apologized profusely to her dad. That when it occurred to me. They arent racist against black people. They are racist against a stereotype of drug selling criminals.Paul (the biker) literally said 'They are not n**** they are God fearing Americas and you will apologize.

The more likely to run is Steve Bullock, the current Governor of Montana, who has strong credentials as a social moderate and economic populist. He's the more likely to run of the two but he'd have to get past the primaries first, so he'd need to start really early to counter the advantages that the frontrunners have. The other is Amy Klobuchar who really doesn't need more of an introduction than she already has. Klobuchar is by far the most likely to beat Trump but whether she'll run is a different question.

"Article excerpt: News reports in recent weeks revealed that the Trump administration is working with newly sworn-in Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on a policy proposal that would require asylum seekers from Central America to remain in Mexico while their asylum cases are adjudicated in the United States, a process that could take many years to play out. Details on the proposal are scarce, but the administration is presumably relying on statutory language that allows migrants to be removed to a safe third country—Mexico in this instance—but also gives the attorney general the discretion to allow migrants to receive asylum in the United States rather than the third country. Mexico is apparently not interested being designated the safe third country, which would allow the United States to return migrants seeking asylum to Mexico so they could apply for asylum in Mexico, but has opened the door to allowing migrants to remain in Mexico while their cases are adjudicated. This policy would at best be an imperfect solution to the problem and will likely be immediately challenged in federal court. But how would it work in practice? The system would be logistically unwieldy for U.S. officials. Migrants would have to be allowed to enter a port of entry to make an asylum claim, and then they would be required to return to Mexico. The United States would have to develop a system for letting them know, while they are in Mexico, when they are expected to appear in immigration court in the United States. The migrants would have to be “paroled” (a limited form of entry under the INA) into the United States to appear in court, and they may require escorts to and from the courts. Should the migrants have counsel in the United States, the government would presumably have to implement a system to allow them to access their lawyers. Additionally, this system could potentially subject migrants to dangerous conditions on the Mexican side of the border.",t3_a4rdal,moderatepolitics

"That's an argument worth having, however it's little more than a convenient excuse here. If conditions were different and Trump sent *more* forces to Syria, he would make appeals to anti-terrorism. That this is being done as part of a quid-pro-quo involving Turkey and Russia is far more likely than Trump developing a conscience, and/or making a breakthrough regarding the appropriateness of American interventionism. I'm generally anti-meddling, but even as hopelessly convoluted as things are in the Middle East, I still we still have some responsibilities there. America elevated the nobody jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to international prominence in the attempt to connect 9/11 to Saddam Hussein. That earned him a 'franchise,' and his ragtag band of miscreants became al-Qaeda-in-Iraq, which was a major part of the post-invasion insurgency. The American counter-surge laboriously wiped out every terrorist cell and supply line they could find, finally pushing al-Qaeda-in-Iraq into Mosul. When it was confirmed that al-Zarqawi and other leaders were dead, we backed off, and the remnants of al-Qaeda-in-Iraq regrouped and formed what we know as ISIS. So, in a way, ISIS is our fault -- specifically that of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, **not** Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, as Trump once stupidly claimed. I'm sure there are other groups that we 'formed', but ISIS isn't just another jihadi group randomly running into checkpoints with bomb vests. They've got sophisticated recruiters that radicalize people over the internet using everything from radical theology and politics all the way down to appealing to gamers with 'this is the real-life *Call of Duty*' style marketing. They pave roads and build madrassas and bring order where there was once chaos, and have political and financial connections that extend beyond local oil barons. Their execution videos aren't mere flip-phone recordings; they're Hollywood-calibre videos of executions, complete with soundtracks, transition effects, slow-motion, multiple angles, and ominous voice-overs. They're going to use our actions against us no matter what we do, so the only choice we have is to exterminate ISIS or see it gain enough political legitimacy that they can align or embed with world powers.

"So what is your suggestion for dealing with the 22 million+ illegal immigrants in the US? What does this question have to do with a wall? Seriously. The wall is supposed to (it doesn't) keep people out. You pose a question concerning people that are already in. This discussion is completely without merit, which actually makes your question have merit, in a way. 'The wall' (whatever that means, since it isn't a proposal, but simply campaign rally shouting) will not 'keep people out' in any meaningful way. We know that. So it is, by definition, a fictional structure in a fictional territory built around campaign rallies. It won't keep people out. It does (or doesn't do) this for various reasons. First of all there aren't many people crossing that 'line' through areas that do not currently have barriers. The effectiveness of barriers is also questionable. Trump admitted as much when he said, at a rally, people could just bring a ladder. So first, there aren't many people taking this route, second it is highly questionable a 'wall' would stop them and third, there are already reasonable measures taken (camera systems, etc). Those measures could be enhanced. More fences could be erected. But Trump has already declared that he doesn't want 'a fence' but 'a brick *beautiful* (sic) wall'. Which doesn't make sense in a real world, if you look at real facts of how to solve a real (though somewhat small, since currently not many people go this way) issue. Thus it has nothing to do with reality. And since we are not in reality, but in 'campaign rally shouting fiction land', we can make the wall solve any issue, like the one which you mentioned, the millions of undocumented people in the US. Which may also not be an issue at all, if you were to look at it rationally using facts. But we aren't in our reality anyways, so why do that? Let's just look at anything and declare it 'an issue'. **If we don't build a wall: So what is your suggestion for dealing with X?** *X can be anything. Which, coincidentally, is exactly what the point of /u/HAL9000000 was. Which you beautifully spelled out in your answer.* *X could be: 'only 10.000 trucks built in 2018 in the US'*. Is that a problem? Maybe. Does it matter? Only if you consider facts. *X could be: 'more than 2 million deaths to opiate overdoses'.* Would that be a problem? Sure. Are there that many people that died? Dunno, since I neither specified a time nor a geographic area, it seems reasonable to assume that worldwide more than 2 million people died to opiates in history.

In many ways I think these sound very similar to many sorts of ‘random chance’ merchandise such collectible card game booster packs (typically a random or semi random assortment of cards and card rarity/power/value) or various collectible items that you cannot see what it is until opening the box (after purchase). I would wonder where exactly this line would be drawn... random loot (sometime from literal boxes) is a hallmark of many games. In MMOs like World if Warcraft the drop chance of a desirable item is often a set random chance from a particular boss... basically this comes down to a form of gambling as well (with your time). This is not to say that predatory games don’t exist—that much is clear.

"Pros are obviously it attracts more fundinging and investment info lower socioeconomic areas who are often missed when we discuss growth rates that have benefitted primarily strong economic areas to begin with.

People hate the socialism word but no matter what way you cut it this is a social welfare program. The way I see it is you could either have the governments invest directly into social welfare in the form of education, health care, housing or food... or you could dangle a tax break in front of the wealthy over some convoluted “opportunity zone” program and leave the control for wealthy individuals to decide how to help those lower class areas. The goal of the wealthy and corporations here will be netting a profit, which isn’t inherently bad but isn’t necessarily good either. As I said before this could end up just being abused as a tax loophole or could be a way to further gentrify areas that the poor live in and eventually price them out while the rich benefit.

If like begins at conception, they're guaranteed soon to be dead human life. Should there be any legal consequences for those human deaths? Does the state have an interest in collecting them, incubating them, and implanting them into willing women? Indeed, does the state have an interest in compelling women whose uteruses are otherwise unoccupied to accept implantation of such collections of human cells in order to preserve those lives? Yes, I admit those are wild flights of extrapolation, but they're logically consistent with the claim that life begins at conception. Thus one more reason for me to believe that life in any meaningful sense begins a few stages later in pregnancy. As for various religions claiming life begins at conception, at least one of those religions also believed the universe revolved around Earth.

"How could this possibly be a good move for the President and Republicans? I don't think that type of political calculus really enters into his thinking. Trump is unique in having probably the shortest political 'horizon' of any major political figure in American history. His loyalty to the Republican party is negligible. He was never politically active before running for office, so he has no friends or benefactors that he's tied to. Whether he wins re-election or not, he is unlikely to hold any political office again after being president. If he has a shot at re-election, it rests almost completely on his core base coming out in support of him and tipping the electoral college by running the board on rural red states. Doing crazy things that lose in court because they were drafted by political pundits rather than Constitutional lawyers is better for energizing his base because resentment against the court system and political elites is his bread and butter. The odds that he is going to be able to entice moderates over the next couple years are essentially zero- he doesn't have that kind of discipline and hasn't shown much inclination for the kind of detailed policy work that might actually put some more measurable accomplishments on the board. A significant shutdown would probably be blamed on the GOP and be disastrous for them congressionally, but Trump doesn't care if they get slaughtered in battleground states.

"One argument that I've heard from conservatives is that the Russian investigation is a witch hunt because it hasn't found any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russia. So I've decided to paste the relevant portion here. >The Department of Justice asked Mr Mueller to investigate “any links and/or co-ordination” between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Start with the links. >One set ran through the Trump Organisation, which was attempting to build a tower in Moscow, a project that continued throughout the Republican primaries of 2016. A second set ran through Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser, who took it upon himself to establish a private line of communication with the Russian ambassador in Washington, after Mr Trump won the election. >There are three more links, which look more like Russian intelligence operations. One went via an enthusiastic Russian member of the National Rifle Association (nra), Maria Butina, and her sponsor, Alexandr Torshin, then the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank. Emails from May 2016 provided to the House Intelligence Committee show that Mr Torshin contacted the campaign, offering an “overture from President Putin.” Both Russians exchanged emails with the president’s eldest son. But the hoped-for meeting, at an nra gathering in Kentucky, never happened, partly because Jared Kushner counselled against it. Ms Butina has since been indicted as a spy. >Then there is the link that ran through New York, where Donald Trump junior, Mr Kushner and Paul Manafort, then Mr Trump’s campaign chairman, met a Russian lawyer claiming to have embarrassing information about Hillary Clinton. That meeting apparently proved disappointing. Still, Don junior made misleading statements about it and his father dictated a statement about what had been discussed, which was issued in the son’s name and was later found to be false, too. >The final known set of links runs through London, and involves a fifth-rate foreign-policy adviser to Mr Trump, George Papadopoulos, and an equally distinguished Maltese academic and grifter, Joseph Mifsud. Mr Mifsud ran an institute called the London Academy of Diplomacy, which did not exist, and boasted of his links to the Russian government. The pair met in Rome in March 2016 and then twice in London. In April Mr Mifsud told Mr Papadopoulos that the Russian government had “dirt” on Mrs Clinton. >That leaves one last channel, about which there has been much speculation but little proof. Russia’s military intelligence arm, the gru, which was responsible for hacking into the Democratic National Committee’s email server, used WikiLeaks to publish its material. For the past two years investigative journalists have been trying to find out whether anyone from the Trump campaign co-ordinated with WikiLeaks over the release of the stolen material. Don junior did send a message to WikiLeaks on Twitter, asking for advance notice of a future release of material, but apparently received no reply. The special counsel’s indictments have not yet shed any light on this last channel, either.",t3_a58tlb,moderatepolitics

Prisoners of war held overseas do not have the right to a proper trial with representation. PS if you think this is a GOP thing you are mistaken. While Obama did not have the power to move the prisoners to the US he did have the power to give them all fair trials while in GITMO. He had the power to make it the most humane holding facility in the world. Neither the GOP nor the DNC wanted to provide all the prisoners a possible out. Don't forget. Obama's first two years the DNC held the house and Senate. While I don't doubt his intentions were to close GITMO going into the white house it's clear his intentions changed once fully briefed. He only tried one thing to change GITMO and it was political theater. He tried to do the only thing he needed approval to do. Move the prisoners...and wouldn't you know it...the gop couldn't stop him. Yet *shockingly* there were just enough DNC votes to stop him. He then just have up.... Things he could have done without congressional approval * moved all prisoners to other over sea prisons and close GITMO * give all prisoners fair trials with representation while they were at GITMO * release all prisoners and close GITMO * make GITMO the pinnacle of how to treat POWs Obama did none of this...just tried the one thing that could be stopped...and his own party helped stop him.

">Regardless, it is very much alive, and it is very much a child of both parents. Your view would make sense to me if you were completely opposed to abortion, but as an argument for paternal rights it's in conflict with the underlying premise of legal abortion in the United States. Maybe things are different in the UK. I don't know the same TV presenters you do. I was just trying to understand your position, but you apparently feel attacked. I do think that several posters in this thread advocating for paternal rights before viability have mischaracterized how marriage works, legally, in the 20th Century and it's important to point that out. >This is incorrect. At some points in the first two trimesters it's indistinguishable from most fish, and lizard embryos, but at no point is it indistinguishable from an organ. The fetus grows inside the placenta, a temporary organ that grows inside the uterus every month. Its blood supply, nervous system, etc. are integrated in fundamentally the same way that every other part of her body is. That is why the fetus prior to viability is regarded as part of the woman's body, and that is why under the relevant legal doctrine she has the right to terminate the pregnancy. That is why Roe v. Wade struck down blanket restrictions on abortion- because they infringe on her right to control her medical care and privacy without due process. I don't think what you are advocating could stand up, legally, because getting a marriage license is not due process and contrary to what you are trying to claim with regards to adultery, etc., you do not give up any of your civil or human rights when you get married.

Input from the world of payment processing: I don't have any direct knowledge of Subscribestar's attempts, but my quick googling of the service (I just became aware of it today) suggests two big problems: 1) Crowdfunding is not a particularly popular/common type of processing and many processors don't support it. Which has nothing to do with Subscribestar specifically, it just has to do with them not wanting to take on the extra complications of offering services for crowdfunding. So the site already has fewer options, because you can't just force a company to start offering a service they don't offer. 2) I read that they're Russian-based? Ignoring the fact that it's Russia specifically for the time being, payments from other countries is a whole can of worms. It's, again, something that many processors don't do or don't want to do. There's more risk involved, there are international laws and regulations that come into play. It's a hassle. Of course, there are plenty of processors that allow businesses to take international payments. But now combine the two - international crowdfunding. And then add in smaller issue 3: 3) If Subscribestar is like Patreon, a lot of the transactions are small amounts, and since processor markups are usually percentage-based, they're not necessarily getting a lot of profit for doing this type of processing.

"Your 'legal conundrums' really aren't. If they're 'deaths in terms of biology,' then they're deaths, period. Abortions should be banned, yes. This is a logical conclusion of 'life begins at conception,' which is itself a logical biological conclusion. Care for ectopic pregnancies should not be banned... 'How can this be,' you ask, 'if that requires an abortion?' It doesn't require an abortion. We aren't consequentialists. In any illness involving a pregnant mother, you provide medical care for both the mother and the child; if in the course of care for the mother (e.g. for an ectopic pregnancy) where a diseased organ is removed and the child dies, this isn't an abortion as the death of the child isn't intended. This isn't a case of 'self defense' because, again, we're not consequentialist. The baby isn't out to 'kill' the mother. The cause of death for either mother or child would be the presence of a diseased organ. There's a clear distinction to be made between abortion (where the death of the child is clearly intended) and unfortunate but necessary medical procedures (where the death of the child is not intended) where the death of either mother or child could result (e.g. a mother may chose to forego chemotherapy to save her child, should this be ruled a suicide 'for which the law should remain indifferent?'

"FTA: >But the banality of the god of progress, the idea that the best life is writing explainers for Vox in order to make the world a better place, never quite slakes the thirst for something deeper. Liberalism is a set of procedures, with an empty center, not a manifestation of truth, let alone a reconciliation to mortality. But, critically, it has long been complemented and supported in America by a religion distinctly separate from politics, a tamed Christianity that rests, in Jesus’ formulation, on a distinction between God and Caesar. And this separation is vital for liberalism, because if your ultimate meaning is derived from religion, you have less need of deriving it from politics or ideology or trusting entirely in a single, secular leader. It’s only when your meaning has been secured that you can allow politics to be merely procedural. >So what happens when this religious rampart of the entire system is removed? I think what happens is illiberal politics. The need for meaning hasn’t gone away, but without Christianity, this yearning looks to politics for satisfaction. And religious impulses, once anchored in and tamed by Christianity, find expression in various political cults. These political manifestations of religion are new and crude, as all new cults have to be. They haven’t been experienced and refined and modeled by millennia of practice and thought. They are evolving in real time. And like almost all new cultish impulses, they demand a total and immediate commitment to save the world. >Now look at our politics. We have the cult of Trump on the right, a demigod who, among his worshippers, can do no wrong. And we have the cult of social justice on the left, a religion whose followers show the same zeal as any born-again Evangelical. They are filling the void that Christianity once owned, without any of the wisdom and culture and restraint that Christianity once provided. I agree, and I'll take the Pro-America Trump cult any day of the week over the left's cult. More: >And so we’re mistaken if we believe that the collapse of Christianity in America has led to a decline in religion. It has merely led to religious impulses being expressed by political cults. Like almost all new cultish impulses, they see no boundary between politics and their religion. And both cults really do minimize the importance of the individual in favor of either the oppressed group or the leader. >And this is how they threaten liberal democracy. They do not believe in the primacy of the individual, they believe the ends justify the means, they do not allow for doubt or reason, and their religious politics can brook no compromise. They demonstrate, to my mind, how profoundly liberal democracy has actually depended on the complement of a tolerant Christianity to sustain itself — as many earlier liberals (Tocqueville, for example) understood.",t3_a57ryt,moderatepolitics

Further, he's just factually incorrect sometimes. Since political entities no longer believe in the principal of charity, this lends you his political opponents blowing everything he says wildly out of proportion. He never said 'Mexicans are rapists' or 'you should grab women by the pussy'. So those lies repeated over and over make his inconsistencies seem more forgivable. Second, I believe he lacks the guile with which to effectively deceive the American people. Third, I've seen no compelling evidence that he's done anything as wrong as the things I mentioned done by the Clintons and Obama. I do not view Obama as a Christ like savior who was a great and noble president. I think he made some huge mistakes. Not as bad Clinton, maybe better than Bush Sr. No compelling evidence at all, even now. So no. I Trump doesn't really have any scandals in the ballpark with those others. Maybe he will.

I think the answer in each case is that voters can't maintain perfect knowledge of what their representatives are doing at all times. We have representative (as opposed to direct) democracy in the first place for that very reason. Voters have lives and can't fully inform themselves so as to vote directly on every issue.

Republicans have never put forward a law that even attempted to be fair. I'm fairly certain that if Republicans proposed laws included giving out the IDs for free this wouldn't be a problem. At the moment most (all?) ID cost money, and poll taxes aren't allowed. So any ID law will probably be struck down as unconstitutional. Because poll taxes as small as $0.25 have been struck down past by the Supreme Court, there is good reason to believe the Republicans aren't even making a good-faith effort to make laws. This is much like have a bunch of state-level legislators put forward laws favoring Christianity knowing full well they'll rapidly get struck down by the Supreme Court, but in the meantime the laws are popular with rural locals and can be used to Garner votes despite wasting huge amounts of State funds. Finally, something else United States is fucking stupid about, all other civilized countries have a centralized ID card. here in the United States we simply don't have anything, the closest thing we have is the social security card and it's optional. There's no law mandating that you get a social security card. ",t3_a2bgr0,moderatepolitics
"I agree. I find that this is an example of the Rorschach test nature of Trump’s presidency. Sometimes, the wall is a physical barrier (“steel slats”, or “transparent” enough to allow border patrol to see through it, or a “beautiful wall”), other times it refers to improvements and repairs to existing physical barriers, and other times it is a metaphor for border security overall. To me, this type of rhetoric makes it hard to see good faith in any of the arguments. If Trump wants $5 billion (or any amount) for border security (not just a wall), he should work with his political supporters to put *that* proposal on the table. But he’s drawn the line at money for a wall — money to specifically build a wall along the southern border of the country — and its difficult to understand that as a metaphor or an analogy or whatever when that’s the bill that passed the House last week.

The market based plans from seem to have stabilized and in some states, in Tennessee we saw an expansion of carriers and a 14.8% average premium reduction. We did not expand Medicaid so still a relatively large percentage of the population. The expansion of Medicare for All in several states would have consequences for other states particularly if it eats into the profits of nationwide or regional insurance or medical corporations. If they lose money in a Medicare for All state they would increase costs in nonexpansion states to make up for it. The ACA was less disruptive because it supplemented existing insurance with subsidies and provided coverage for the more poor people with Medicaid expansions. A slow rollout could be disruptive to jobs in the insurance industry and possibly certain areas of healthcare as well.

"I think the Wall Street Journal article sums it up why the Judge was overstepping his bounds. Over all it isn't a big deal, but the Mueller team had to remind the judge Flynn hasn't been convicted, much less charges brought against him for those things, and correct some falsehoods the judge made. You can't really berate a defendant for crimes he isn't convicted of. Presumption of innocence, innocent until proven guilty etc. Flynn is only in court on 1 charge and that is it. He also as an impeccable crime free career. It's a character attack a judge should avoid. As for Willis, I had to do some research on what you were even talking about. I greatly enjoyed the Netflix series though. I believe your talking about the judge citing past crimes as reasons for his sentencing. Well Steven Avery has a history of crimes, actual ones. The judge also called him one of the most dangerous people to ever step foot in his courtroom. You could argue that's an embellishment of reality, but whatever, his past consisted of breaking into a bar, burning a cat I believe, and driving a person off the road. Pretty shitty things but the demon he is made out to be because of those actions? Mmm okay. I can't help but think the judge still thinks he is guilty of rape while making those comments. But he was still commenting of matters that were in his criminal past. He didn't go off the rails and accuse him of being a child molester....there are accusations on that end but he was never charged nor prosecuted for anything like that. So it would be wrong to paint someone something they are not in a court of law. And that is essentially what Sullivan did, commenting about crimes in which Flynn isn't guilty or even charged with, and he has no criminal past. I hope that explains it",t3_a7e07h,moderatepolitics

">it does not follow that all ideas have some merit. That's not the claim though, at least not the one I'd make. The claim is that it's important to defend even those ideas without merit, because oppression is easiest to stop when it first starts and oppressive laws start by targeting those. It's totally fair to think that anti-vax has no merit (because that belief is correct) but it's important to defend the rights of anti-vaxxers for the sake of everyone else's rights too. And besides, you act like you're making some controversial point that you're going to get martyred for making, but Reddit loves to make the 'good ideas don't convince normies, they're too stupid' point all the time too.

"You seem to be under the assumption that I am referencing your CNN article and directing debating the validity of that article. I have not posted as such in any section of this thread. None of my arguments referenced any CNN source in this thread unless it was a direct reply to you. The primary source of material in my arguements has been Trumps own article. again, HERE.  The link I provided does not contain any other information other then the contents of the article Trump wrote. As for your quote, perhaps I did not argue the point directly because it was there was not argument to be made over the nature of the direct quote. but I did address it. From my post Talk is cheap, the article is not. In this case literally. I see more evidence of intent in the article then I do that interview. Then yours >The point was CNN wasn't telling the truth when they claimed Trump said he didn't 'prejudge' the 5 teens as he wasn't talking about the 5 teams he was talking about a completely different group of people. So rereading your posts I am somewhat confused, I never argued CNN was not wrong in this case of directly misrepresenting Trump's quote, I argued that Trump prejudged the CP5. I provided citation and reasoning for this, none of which used CNN as a source. and was quite clear in the nature of the arrangement. After all, I stated and bolded the arguments I was going to make. The quote, is as you said, from another issue. You seem to attempting to present the fact that CNN used misdirection in regards to this quote not being about the CP5 as proof that there was no Pre-Judgement on Trumps part. How does one misdirected quote clear him from any assertion about pre-judgement? So lets clear that up by restating my argument.I argue that there substantial evidence that Trump Pre-Judged the CP5. I did not reference CNN's quote when presenting my reasoning except in response to you. All the quotes I am referencing are not from any CNN source, but from Trumps own article. Please review my previous post if you must. I am making these arrangements of my own volition. I make this arguments to see if there are major holes in my reasoning. There is one thing keeping me from abandoning my argument that Trump did call for the CP5 execution. The context of 'They' In Trump's article. 'They' Only appears after his mention of the CP5 incident. 'They' stops appearing in the article after his second example of crime. WHO... are... they? He does define 'They' in the Article. If the CP5 are NOT 'They' How explicitly are the CP5 defined as a separate entity in the context of Trumps article? because Trump mentioned that 'They' kill and the CP5 did not kill? A single word is not enough to distance 'they' from this. I have heard your arguments on this, and found them somewhat wanting. Please refrain from name calling. If you attempt to assert that I am some how regurgitating CNN despite the fact of never quoting them nor referencing their articles (again, except when it is response to you) then I would have to assert that you too are a 'fucking liar' Edit: If I type out 'moist' instead of 'must' one more time I will cut off my fingers and use a text to speech device.

"That was pretty short! I get that the Cohen revelations aren’t particularly shocking. For any other politician, paying off two women right before an election would be a career ending scandal. The article itself cites John Edwards. Funny how they use him as an example for how it isn’t all that big a deal, but His scandals made him toxic and ended his career. For trump, we are arguing over minutiae of campaign finance laws. He gets a free pass for scandals. I realize this is a tangent, I just thought it was interesting. Another thing I noticed about the article was both the title and the content of it seemed to imply that Cohen implicating trump in two campaign finance violations is the culmination of the whole Mueller probe. If it were, I’d agree that it was a massive witch hunt and a waste of money. But the article failed to even mention the revelations about Manafort, and even more importantly, Flynn. There is *a lot* more on its way. Sure- we can only speculate about the redacted parts of the memos and we can only guess what comes next. But it seems like that article was really cherry picking. You make a good point that it is still too early to know, and it is probably dumb to speculate so much about what will be revealed in the future. But based on what we have been finding out, it seems unlikely that things won’t continue getting worse for trump. If the Cohen stuff is the worst it gets for trump, I’ll be shocked.

"Napolitano says Mueller's recent filings shows the investigation continues to acquire new significant evidence and thus is not close to ending.

Second, he keeps acquiring new evidence. Last week, when Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to lying to Congress about Trump's negotiations with Russian authorities during the 2016 presidential campaign to build Trump Tower Moscow, Cohen claimed he lied so as to further Trump's political message, which has been one of zero relationships with Russian officials during the campaign. The third reason for rejecting the belief that Mueller will soon shut down is Mueller's declaration to a federal judge in Washington last week that Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager during the time the Trump campaign had 87 communications with Russians, lied to FBI agents in defiance of his commitment to be truthful to them made during his guilty plea in federal court in September. Mueller will no doubt seek to indict Manafort for each of those lies and then try him -- a trial that could not occur until mid-2019. He also go after Giuliani for criticizing the investigation for using the same tactics Giuliani regularly used as a prosecutor. Yet the more he cheerleads the more he undercuts his reputation in the legal, judicial and law enforcement communities. That's because when he was the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, he excelled at utilizing the most extreme and aggressive prosecutorial techniques that the courts permitted -- the very ones he is now attacking Mueller for using.",t3_a3s18w,moderatepolitics

"refusing responsibility for planting worthless soybeans To be fair they probably didn’t know that the market would be the lowest it’s ever been for soybeans. Even in a down market year most guys can usually make a little bit of money. Consider especially if you’re mostly a soybean farmer, and have all the equipment to farm soybeans only you’d be hesitant to farm something you don’t know much about. You’d probably lose just as much money if not more than they are now. bailout checks of around $7,000. I’m sure this second round will not only allow them to pay off their farm loans, but to keep luxuries like refrigerators and smart phones Not sure if you’re familiar with farm loans, but they’re usually $100,000 at the minimum. Some of the lower value crops (corn) look to make ~$1,000/acre and most people in Iowa don’t farm less than an 80 acre block I would imagine. So an income of $80,000 vs an income of $10-$20k isn’t exactly letting farmers live a life of luxury. I totally agree with you that farming is risky and people should be held accountable for losing money. Or at least have to pay back the subsidy similarly to a farm loan like over a 10 year period or something. But I do think you have some misconceptions about farmers planting crops and expecting subsidies. For the amount of input put in vs the money in the subsidy I can assure you it’s probably not even half ",t3_a95g2a,moderatepolitics

"It's one study done by a handful of people with very little substance or reality, just alot of wishful thinking and best case scenarios. The reality is government is a slow lumbering beast, that makes everything cost more. You almost never hear of a government program costing less than these so called experts expectations. They are giving you the absolute best case scenario to sell it to you, just like Obamacare was sold to you. For example Obamacare was partly sold on it being deficit neutral or at times it would actually reduce the deficit and costs. What they didn't tell you was for their 10 year projection was that they were going to save for 4 to 5 years in order to create the illusion it didn't cost as much. That and they needed X amount of people just to break even on top of that....another best case scenario that was a false promise. BTW, if we kept the old system and had government just buy insurance at the market rate for people who didn't have insurance it would have cost way less than even that study's estimate. It would have reduced or at least kept insurance in the affordable range. We wouldn't have wasted billions designing websites and we wouldn't have bankrupted middle america for paying for Obamacare....Trump is a partial product of that. If we did nothing and just wrote a check for the non-insured, Trump never wins. The reality was to strip middle America of it's wealth, through taxes, through healthcare....it wasn't designed to actually help everyone.

Our first inclination when somebody claims that they've been robbed or assaulted is not 'well did you actually want them to take your things or hurt you?' 'Are you sure you're not just making this up for attention?' 'Were you dressed in a way that made it more likely for you to be robbed or assaulted?'

According to two of these sources, he politely declined, though conveyed to the campaign his respect for Clinton. A spokesman for the Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Though he declined the overture, the rapport that Mattis enjoyed with Clinton would underscore just how criminally out of place he was while serving with the man who beat her.

"Listen to : Most people think of politics as its own unique public institution governed by impartial laws dating back to the founders. Not so. Politics is, in fact, an industry—most of whose key players are private, gain-seeking organizations. The industry competes, just like other industries, to grow and accumulate resources and influence for itself. The key players work to advance their self-interests, not necessarily the public interest. It’s important to recognize that much of what constitutes today’s political system has no basis in the Constitution. As our system evolved, the parties—and a larger political industrial complex that surrounds them—established and optimized a set of rules and practices that enhanced their power and diminished our democracy. These changes—often created behind closed doors and largely invisible to the average citizen—continue to take their toll at both the federal and the state levels. The politics industry is different from virtually all other industries in the economy because the participants, themselves, control the rules of competition. There is no truly independent regulation of politics that protects the public interest. Free from regulation and oversight, the duopoly does exactly what one would fear: The rivals distort the rules of competition in their favor. Examples of this includes controlling access to the general election ballot, partisan gerrymandering, and the Hastert Rule, which puts partisan concerns above legislating for the public interest.",t3_aaviox,moderatepolitics

John Conness: 'The proposition before us ... relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens....

">The 'legal merging' that several people have in this thread have claimed marriage creates does not exist in fact under the law in any modern legal system in any such simplistic way. And you miss the point again. A child has two parents. If one parent takes the child and moves, preventing the other parent from seeing the child without a court order, then that parent is guilty of kidnapping their own child - this is a very real legal thing. In the case of abortions, this does get tricky, because while the child is very much alive, and is very much a child of both parents, it's not clear at what point the child goes from fetus to full human. On top of this, the child is gestating inside the body of someone else. This means that there is a situation in which two very serious rights can be in conflict - the right to bodily autonomy, and the right to protect your child. >For most of the first two trimesters of gestation, the fetus is indistinguishable from any other organ in a woman's body in that respect. This is incorrect. At some points in the first two trimesters it's indistinguishable from most fish, and lizard embryos, but at no point is it indistinguishable from an organ. I mean, it has organs for christs sake. Regardless, it is very much alive, and it is very much a child of both parents. I could be a dick about this whole thing and say that you are against fathers having any caring role in the lives of their children, but then I'd be deliberately misrepresenting your arguments the way you appear to be trying to do to me. We don't agree. You're willing to lie and misrepresent to make your point. I'm willing to admit that there is a legitimate conflict in interests between two of the most serious biological imperatives that humans have - the right to self determination, and the right to protect our children. There is no compromise that's going to make everyone happy all of the time, and there are situations in my compromise where the man has no right to protect his children. You're not going to talk me into taking a stance where there is no compromise between the two, and I think that marriage and a consensual sexual relationship are reasonable gates to cross through before making an ask this big, particularly when legal separation and divorce are offered as an out.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

"If not states, which level of government? Note that states have jurisdiction over homicide, assault and battery. Why wouldn't they also have jurisdiction over abortion? 1. When to prohibit: if critical fetal deficiencies only manifest late in a pregnancy, and the odds that the baby would live at least 1 week after birth drop below, say, 10%, why should there be any restrictions? If you mean completely elective abortions, certainly not prohibited before fetuses born at a given age have less than 50% odds of reaching 1 year of age. I'd be more willing to accept state governments prohibiting abortion as long as those state governments assume 100% of all extraordinary medical expenses over $10,000 or 5% of the parents' previous year's AGI, whichever is more. If the state is willing to pay for severely deformed babies, great. 2. Better question. Perhaps no limit on number, but only 2 covered by healthcare insurance. The rich will get as many abortions as needed, so as long as rich women can travel while pregnant, this would only be a restriction on the nonrich. 3. No. Doctors shouldn't be obliged to communicate anything which isn't medically relevant. 4. Tricky: for married couples, maybe the wife should have sole discretion, but the husband's preference should be recorded, AND it should be a consideration in divorce proceedings. For nonmarried, the father shouldn't have a choice. 5. Healthcare insurance should be required to cover abortions if they cover erectile dysfunction medicine. That is, cover anything involved in the reproductive process, MUST cover EVERYTHING. 6. Here's where you separate those against abortion because they believe life begins at conception from those against abortion only after fetal viability. The latter really shouldn't have any issues with morning after pills. The former mostly believe sex not for procreation is a sin, so they'd prefer such sex to be illegal, in which case there'd be no legal purpose for morning after pills. 7. In the US, there are only 2 alternatives: Roe v Wade is correct, in which case women have a relatively unrestricted right to privacy which includes abortion, so states can't restrict that right except on the periphery; or Roe v Wade is overturned, in which case abortion returns to the states. There's no clear interstate commerce basis for federal involvement. All the federal government can do is decide whether or not to provide any funding for abortions. Regulation of abortion is strictly up to the states, well, except for DC for which Congress could impose its will on the locals. If SCOTUS overturns Roe v Wade, the big question would become whether states could impose any restrictions on pregnant women within state boundaries traveling out of state. If states can't restrict pregnant women's travel, richer pregnant women could travel to any place where abortions were legal. The next big question would be whether state prohibiting abortion would have grounds for legal action against such women obtaining abortions outside the state. IANAL, but if one lives in a dry county, one can travel to another county and consume alcohol but the county of residence can't pursue any legal action against such residents. Abortion is obviously different than drinking, but I don't see how any state can restrict what their own residents do while out of state. IOW, if, say, West Virginia outlaws abortion, Maryland abortion clinics may have a lot of patients from across the state line. I believe most abortion opponents won't be satisfied without a federal prohibition, but I can't see how that'd be constitutional.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

This question?: 'At what point does one person's bodily autonomy supersede someone else's right to protect their children?' I believe I've answered it repeatedly. Until there is a child, a.k.a. a human being biologically independent of the host, bodily autonomy supersedes anyone else's hopes and wishes. To use my previous metaphor, until the egg can be safely removed and you can sit on the egg yourself or until the egg hatches and is a chick, you cannot command another on what to do with their own body. I agree this is horribly unfair but pregnancy and delivery has always been horribly unfair. The woman is 'stuck' bearing the physical cost and the man can bug out at anytime. A woman has a limited amount of biological capital to spend nurturing and producing life. She should spend it wisely and not be forced to spend it as her spouse or the government or the pope dictates. Giving the husband authority to decide on aborition is a hopeless suggestion anyway as the obvious recourse would be to have coat hanger abortions, deny the spouse sex, claim you weren't the father, and divorce. This isn't a positive result even if the woman is forced against her will to produce a child for the marriage is completely doomed after such a blatant disregard to her wishes. Do you suggest your hypothetical unwillingly pregnant wife be monitored 24/7 also? You should because she isn't likely to want to take care of the unwanted fetus and will not feel the need to care about drinking, smoking, eating properly, and engaging in reckless activities so now you are talking about incarceration. Have you completely thought out this dystopian world?",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics
"The are two differences here: First, the 2006 bipartisan fencing bills differ in terms of (a) the kind of barrier they call for, (b) where it goes, (c) what it costs, and (d) how much additional effectiveness it will provide. There's no dispute that certain kinds of fencing in certain areas (e.g. in San Diego) are effective relative to their cost. But those fences are already built and paid for. Congress doesn't need to appropriate more money for existing fencing there. The Trump proposal is to build a giant concrete (or 'steel slat') wall along the entire border - not only mountainous or desert regions, but in parts of Texas where vast tracts of private property will have to be seized and paid for. That fencing isn't effective relative to its cost because it's going to cost a ton of money and not stop enough traffic to justify the price tag. The fact that Democrats supported fencing in other areas at a lower price doesn't mean they support the new fencing at the new price. The second issue is essentially one of fraud. Trump ran on a promise that Americans wouldn't have to write the check for this. Now he wants us to. Forcing Americans to pay lets Trump get away with defrauding voters by promising one price and then charging another. In other words, the earlier bipartisan bills never involved a fraud on the American people - no one was promised that they would cost nothing. But now - independently of the merits of a free fence - Democrats are right to oppose ratifying Trump's fraud by making us pay what Mexico was supposed to. ",t3_aa41oy,moderatepolitics

Every year we are reminded to be careful what you write, don't get to casual because if there is ever an accusation of abuse etc every email you wrote can and will be scrutinized. The entire reason we keep gov emails is in case of an investigation. This was a HUGE DEAL during Hillary,s time as secretary of state. Every professional gov employee knows your emails can be scrutinized since the FOIA. Imo, Hillary was clearly trying to subvert the FOI act. I find it completely implausible that hillary just wanted to use one phone or whatever other lame excuse was given. Now here is where I really got confused and I'm still not sure it's right but it's my understanding that Hillary doing an end run around the FOIA isn't technically a crime.

It goes against the way our system is organized. We don't target people to investigate, we investigate when there is evidence of a crime. Mueller was authorized to look for collusion with Russia to cheat the election. And that's the only charge I'd support coming out of his investigation. Without anything to do with Russia and cheating the election, everything else is fruit from a poison tree. So I guess my first sentence is wrong. I do know how I would feel.

"This is such a funny story. I really hope she runs for President. >Advisers close to Ms. Warren say she has privately expressed concern that she may have damaged her relationships to Native American groups and her own standing with progressive activists, particularly those who are racial minorities. Several outside advisers are even more worried: They say they believe a plan should be made to repair that damage, possibly including a strong statement of apology. It's interesting that this - not her 'Native American' cookbook 'Pow Wow Chow' - is what offended them. Anyways, it was crystal clear what she had to do: apologize for claiming to be Native American, it was a form of cultural appropriation that people used to engage in more freely and now we've learned its hurtful blahblahblah. That she *doubled down* is so very, very hilarious. She's at least as thin-skinned as Trump, I think, because she couldn't just admit that it was stupid to claim to be Native American.",t3_a3ptqd,moderatepolitics

"Well his lies are pretty ridiculous. You are being beyond charitable with how you describe his proclivity to lie. You are right that he isn’t terribly sophisticated with his lies- I think it is more that he just says whatever he thinks will serve him best in any given situation. He *doesn’t care* about the truth. That isn’t a recipe for long-term success. It seems like you like trump, but are also willing to acknowledge that he is capable of some seriously scandalous stuff, and you also seem like you will accept it if/when it comes to light.

Instead of arguing with you about the state of the economy, our security, or our standing in the world- I’ll just ask you this: wouldn’t pretty much any republican have done things largely the same? For all his bluster, the only things that set him apart from what other republicans are the things that there seems to be a consensus on both sides are bad- like the tariffs. So why is it worth having such a blowhard? You say we blow his rhetoric out of proportion, but I disagree. I hold my young son to a higher standard than we hold trump. I don’t let my son lie. I don’t make excuses for him or let him make excuses for himself. I don’t let him call girls in his class ugly. I don’t let him call his peers stupid. When he brags, I make sure to keep him grounded.

"I will address this in two sections **1.** My argument that the Article is centered around the Central Park 5 and did call for their execution. **2.** Trump's per-judgement is obvious. **First Section** Again, the title of the Article, is 'Bring back the Death Penalty Bring Back our Police'. This is certainly a call to lethal action. **Note:** I will be using CP5 to mean the Central Park five in some sections here. As you stated, you admitted that it at least partly written in reaction to the Central Park 5. However I believe that the Article is a direct response to that incident, and only mentioned what Donald Trump considered soft crime practices as a reason to support it's main theme around the Central Park 5. Lets look at one complete paragraph from the Article. Quote >At what point did we cross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals to every age to beat and rape a helpless woman then laugh at her family's anguish?An why do they laugh? They laugh because they know that soon, very soon, they will be returned to the streets to rape and maim and **kill** once again--and yet face no great personal risk to themselves. Here we see a clear connection to the Central Park 5, he directly references the incident, he also mentions that he believes that leaving these people that committed the crime on the streets would result in murder. A direct quote from him, 'They will return to the streets to kill.' further down he says.. >Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do not think so. I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. Considering the previous paragraph, is it not a sound conclusion to come to that he is talking about the same people that he mentioned above? Mayor Koch made these statements as a reaction to public anger around the CP5. Why or Why not would that paragraph not be talking about the same people? He spends the rest of the Article elaborating around that theme, he uses it as the base board to build his argument. I would call that a direct focus on the CP5. The Central Park 5 is the core argument. The Article is centered around it. There is one introductory paragraph, and then he goes onto the CP5 incident directly. Lets go and take a look at the structure of the Article to elaborate on this. He has two examples of crime in the Article. The CP5 incident is listed first, and the second, a considerably more vague mention of Police throwing out abusive patrons at a restaurant. It is also towards the end of the Article. It is not the core of his argument. He spends considerably more time around the first example he gives. He doesn't give an example of any other crime, the CP5 is the base of which he builds his argument. Perhaps if he gave the other example first an argument could be made that CP5 was not the core of his argument, but he lists it first and spends the rest of Article explaining his thoughts on the issue. He does call for the execution of the Central Park 5. He directly says that the people who committed the act will return to the streets to kill, (this is in the end of the second paragraph, the one that directly discusses the CP5 incident.) and that killers should be executed. (this is in the following paragraph, where he dismisses Mayor Koch's call to calm public anger over the CP5) Consider that he calls for killers to be executed in the same paragraph the mayor calls for peace over the CP5 accusations. A direct connection between the call for lethal force and the CP5. Looking at the provided reasoning, why would these above conclusions that the Article was about the CP5 and a call for execution be an outright lie? **Second Section** As for your assertion that Trump stated he was not 'per-judging' the five teens, the evidence in the Article seems to link to the contrary. Just because he says it doesn't make it True, actions speak louder then words here. from the 'Bring back the Death Penalty' Article criminals to every age to beat and rape a helpless woman then laugh at her family's anguish? - **The CP5** An why do they laugh? - **They being the CP5.The criminals laugh in the previous sentence** They laugh because they know that soon, very soon, they will be returned to the streets to rape and maim and kill once again--and yet face no great personal risk to themselves. **Here is the accusation.The Criminals of the CP5 Kill** That is the definition of pre judgment.

From your link: The village’s population is a little over a thousand; most of the adults spent years as refugees during Guatemala’s 1960-1996 civil war, in which the US-backed military committed a genocide on the country’s indigenous population. In 1982, the Guatemalan army massacred more than three hundred people in Nentón. The survivors found refuge in Mexico, just nine kilometers away, and only returned years after, as the conflict came to an end. But the peace deal did nothing to end Guatemala’s systemic racism and corruption, which has channelled the country’s wealth to a small urban elite, and the people of the surrounding Nentón municipality were forced to rebuild their communities without any governmental support. In impoverished villages such as Yalambojoch, agriculture is the only work available. Such grinding poverty makes emigration an attractive alternative, according to the town’s mayor, Lucas Pérez. “People leave our village, find work in the US and send money to help their relatives,” said Pérez, who estimated about 200 people from the tiny village live in the United States.",t3_a9w3zx,moderatepolitics

"Wall Street Journal editorial.... >Well, that was bizarre. We’re referring to the fiasco Tuesday of what was supposed to be the sentencing of Michael Flynn. The sentencing was postponed until next year, but not before federal Judge Emmet Sullivan damaged his own reputation with an extraordinary public attack on the former national security adviser for a crime he’s not been charged with or admitted to. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty a year ago to a single count of lying to the FBI. Yet after being assured that the former three-star general is sticking with his plea, Judge Sullivan unloaded on the defendant over his supposed violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. “All along, you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the National Security Adviser to the President of the United States. That undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably you sold your country out,” said the judge. He also used the words “treason” and “treasonous.” But Mr. Mueller has never charged Mr. Flynn with violating FARA, though the former general did represent the government of Turkey before he joined the Trump Administration. A judge isn’t supposed to lose his cool on the bench and berate a defendant for crimes that haven’t been adjudicated in court, much less spread false information. The outburst was too much even for the lawyers for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who had to tell the judge that Mr. Flynn did not represent any foreign entity while at the White House. Judge Sullivan later apologized, sort of, telling the courtroom not “to read too much into” his outburst about “treason.” But that came after the falsehood made global headlines.

That's not at all saying that she's Native American by any significant margin, of course; it's saying that her 'account' is vague enough that she didn't really make any strong claims. Part of the issue seems to be conflating 'claiming to be Native American' with 'claiming to have Native American ancestry'. Had Warren done the former, then I 100% agree that a sincere apology is in order. But all the evidence given so far to show that she actually did this, including previously on this sub, have only confirmed the latter.

The Never-Trump GOP centrists have failed to prove they have any real political power. They retired in droves or lost to democrats in suburban seats in Congress, have slowly been pushed out of the Trump administration, and have seen their publications shrink or shut down due to lack of readership. A lot of them have become Democrats. The country is more partisan than ever, and long-time Dems aren't going to have any interest in voting for someone with a (R) in their recent past. Dems feel they've been leading the charge against an authoritarian for two years on a tilted playing field, they won't conclude that by voting for a 'unifying' conservative. None of the potential Democratic nominees are so off-the-reservation that they'd push people to the center in droves. Bernie's progressivism has been legitimized and incorporated into the platform, and the debate will be about the degree of implementation, not the policies themselves. That's not going to turn off a lot of voters. And, lastly, Trump has fully incorporated the GOP base into his base, who are going to be the people voting in the primary mostly. A strong independent bid by Kasich or someone similar might be enough to sink Trump electorally, but their role will be purely as spoiler.

The quote from the other article I posted here, for reference. >Members of the armed services are not covered by the Hatch Act, but they are subject to DOD Directive 1344.10, “Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces,” last updated in February 2008. That directive prohibits service members from engaging in partisan political activities **while in uniform.** If what the USAFE says here is true, then no violation has occurred. Edit. I just thought more about this. The USAFE says they held the hats for signing. It is some what vague if the USAFE says they were in uniform while they did this. The USAFE only says that they did not WEAR the hats while in Uniform, but the DOD Directive 1344.10, says that any service member **engaging in partisan political activities** while in uniform is in violation of said Directive. So in other words, they do not have to wear the hat in Uniform for it to be a violation. They merely have to engage in partisan political activities while in Uniform. Signing a hat with a campaign slogan on it takes the cake. ",t3_aad04q,moderatepolitics

"Not sure if you're fishing for a certain answer or not. First we have to define 'violent' and we have to define 'racist.' I suspect it's in the variance in those definitions, is where the discussion will be. To me, being loud, unruly, and stubborn is not 'violent.' I don't think shouting at people is violence, or yelling mean words, or getting in someones face. That's intimidation, not violence. I don't think refusing to let someone through with non-violent methods is violence - for example: locking arms in front of a entrance and refusing to get out of the way. Violence to me is physically hurting someone with force. I don't think that using the N-word for illustrative purposes is racist (note how I don't use it here, in an illustrative sense though...). I don't think intentionally saying inflammatory things to get a rise out of people is racist. I think it's just being a dick; and it's even more of a dick move to then be angry, or smug, when you get a rise out of people - as that was the goal in the first place. If you poke a bear, you can't be shocked and appalled when the bear gets pissed at you. I think being a white supremacist or espousing things like 'white genocide' is racist - I support people's right to be racist, just like I support people's right to not want to associate with them.

As for whether there has been zero evidence of collusion, that's flat out not true. There is evidence of multiple attempts by the Trump campaign to collude, which is far more than zero.

"And now for something completely different... &#x200B; Normally I post articles relating to immigration etc, however I'm also a huge, huge gamer and nerd. That being said, I love it when politics and gaming collide because it allows me to make wonderful posts like this one on two subjects I legitimately enjoy, gaming AND politics. So let's get right to the meat and potatoes of things. &#x200B; So this is no doubt inspired by other countries like . Basically, the premise is simple. Games put a box in that has a random chance to give you various goodies. Depending on the game, this can range from a pet that follows you around to a skin (basically a different outfit on a character) to other things like weapons and armor. Now for the games like Overwatch and other games like it, you can get skins, sprays (icons you can display) voice overs but nothing that offers a real tangible benefit. &#x200B; In the case of mobile games, this is often times different. Mobile games that are 'hero' collectors, things like Fate Grand Order, Summoners war and such have a lootbox / summoning mechanic that gives you a random hero / character, often times the rare ones being super rare. We're literally talking .01% or less in some cases. Given that the loot boxes themselves have animations that are shiny and appealing to look at, and the nature of games often times attempting to appeal to the widest audience possible (this includes children as well in most games...) many people believe that lootboxes are a form of gambling and can poison the minds of our youths making them hopeless gambling addicts. &#x200B; In earlier years, games used to put costumes and such on sale directly. See an outfit you like? You buy the virtual currency from the shop and buy the item in question. However, some games have made it a measure to literally only include things available via loot boxes. Often times seasonal event items like mounts or pets that you have to spend money on these boxes for a random chance to obtain it. There is no other way than to literally roll the dice for now. &#x200B; Now that we have the explanation out of the way, I for one, hate the mechanic and feel that it is often times predatory. Not necessarily to kids, it's just designed to rake in as much money as possible. For example, let's say an outfit costs $10. You pay that price and the outfit is yours. This generates a number of sales. Now, you take that same outfit, put it in a box with say a 10% chance to get it out of said box, with other usable, but often times unwanted items and price the box at 1.99 or even 2$ even. All of a sudden you've raised more than you would with direct sales because the people that want it are often times going to spend more money on average getting the item out of the box. If it's a 10% chance, you'd need, on average mind you, at least 10 boxes to procure the item which means that outfit has now cost $20. Take in account that percentages aren't always so forgiving and you can have people spend up to hundreds of dollars for said outfit..Which, to be frank, I -have- seen rich people spend that much in games on loot boxes. &#x200B; Frankly, I think the practice is crap. It's not illegal yet, but it is crap imo. Even more so when the outfit is 'bound' and can't be sold like they are in some games, though thankfully this is becoming rarer and rarer. With games targeting younger and younger audiences though, do you find this concerning? What are your thoughts?",t3_a2jxrb,moderatepolitics

">But they're still *business* choices. That's the rub isn't it? Personal choices *are* business choices under sole proprietor.

This lack of separation makes it impossible for her to exercise her personal 1st amendment rights, and choosing to boycott a state is protected as a 1st amendment right. However, because there is no distinction between her and her business, legally, the contract would prevent her from personally boycotting, as any boycott she would make would be also made by the business... aka .. her. &#x200B; Edit: I'm not saying it makes sense, I'm just saying how it is.

It’s the cornerstone of both the legislative and judicial branch. The legislative branch is the one that creates laws. The judicial branch only judges guilt or innocence based upon law that has already been created. The Supreme Court often sets president on constitutionality but they do not decide what is constitutional. That power rests with the constitution. Which can only be amended by the legislative branch. Suffice it to say that arguing for restriction of speech goes against the constitution no matter your intention. And my job(and the job of fellow patriots) is to make sure that the legislative branch never alters the constitution in a way that abolishes our liberties.

"Wow... it would seem you're right about other western countries and walls... although I would argue that it's a reflection of nationalist/nativist ideology within the western world more than something that is either western or not. I don't perceive building walls and strong borders to be the same thing. There's evidence that walls do more to keep illegal immigrants in than they do to keep them out... and the vast majority of illegal immigrants don't come to the US by land... they come by plane. The only real thing that a border wall is good at doing is creating PR. It's an easy talking point for far-right politicians to get people excited. There's no evidence that it would be effective if built and there's definitely no justifying a partial shutdown of the government over building one. Again, I'm of the opinion that we have plenty of border security... we don't need more. But if I consider what we could do to improve border security, or more specifically reduce illegal immigration... the answer would be to use technology. Privacy invading technology. Cameras and facial recognition. Everyone who gets a visa gets their picture taken and once they've over stayed their visa, they get flagged when a camera sees them somewhere in the country. Personally, I think this takes things too far... but that's where I think we're at. We've already built a security up to that point, this is the next realistic step to doing anything meaningful to improving security.

"I grant viability isn't an absolutely clear, objectively measurable point between fertilization and live birth. That doesn't mean it's invalid. It also doesn't mean its subjective. It means it's not the same in all situations. Where have I advocated euthanasia? You seem to be unable to separate abortion from euthanasia. You have that much difficulty distinguishing between BEFORE and AFTER live birth? Live birth is an obscure concept for you? At least you're now being clear that you mean ***murder*** in terms of morality. Guess what? I don't share your moral definitions of terms, in this case *life* and *murder*. You seem to believe there's only one possible morality, and it's yours. Prove that. The point here is that different people hold different moral principles. Some don't accept capital punishment under any circumstances, others do for several circumstances. When there is no broad consensus on the morality of certain acts in certain circumstances, i.e., no recognized objective universal moral rule, don't be surprised when the law is based on something else. Unlike morality, the law is the law. It may be an artificial construct, but it's relatively objective and definitely universally applicable within its jurisdiction. You can't prove your morality is shared by all. You can't prove your morality should be accepted by all. Now semantics: intentional killing of another human isn't always murder. Unless you don't believe in self-defense. Do you? Or protecting some lives if the only way to do so is to take other lives, e.g., police killing active shooters. So, no, the willful (intentional) ending of another human life is not murder in all circumstances. Is this simple enough for you to understand? Should I make greater effort to use shorter words? The pro-life argument is based on the presumption that life begins at conception. The entire argument which follows may be logically valid, but I don't accept the presumption, so from my perspective the argument is unsound.

The main focus here is abuse of police force and training etc. ALM addressed that this isn't just a black issue. Again, are there unique issue black people face? Of coarse. But wouldn't it be better to have unity against a bigger broader issue and solve that than to focus on a more detailed niche issue? Is the #MeToo movement gaslighting as well because they are addressing all forms of sexual abuse, including men, instead of focusing on just female rapes? That's a much better example of how to address an issue. It was solely women but then you had people like Terry Cruz come out. I'd argue that probably helped the movement more than harmed it. But let's take your side fully. Even IF it started as a negative response towards BLM (which I'm sure there are plenty that felt that way, we all believe different things) I find it incredible saddening that it was a missed opportunity.

Basically it's like call Jews who fought extermination in Germany terrorists for not wanting to be exterminated and for fighting back. Because Turkey has had a decades long campaign of eradicating the Kurdish problem, much like the Jewish problem in Germany. Turkey is also a Nato Ally and a major supply route for American operations from Iraq to Afghanistan. Even if he is a dictator in the making, nearly every diplomatic event favors him due to this status. During the 1st gulf war Turkey was so afraid of the possibility of the Kurds getting their own nation that they threatened invasion from the north and denying the northern attack route into Iraq by American military forces. We had to kiss some major ass and assure them the Kurds wouldn't be a problem to let us use their country as a staging point. This meant co-ordinating with the Kurds to not even fart in the direction of Turkey, or else they might cross the border. The Kurds as a whole are majorly pro-western and Americanized. They love everything about America. We have a long history of working with them to defeat Saddam and now to defeat ISIS. Just to show how sensitive Turkey is to America working with the Kurds, a American special operations soldier was photographed wearing a peshmerga unit patch. It caused an international incident in Turkey and a dressing down of the soldier and promises for it to never happen again. Kurds are just great people who deserve their own country, even more than the Palestinians deserve it. Iran will hunt them, Turkey will hunt them, ISIS hunted them, even Syrian regime hunted them. No one wants them in their country and no one wants them to stay in their strongholds which also have vast fields of oil wells. Only America power has given them any kind of semblance of Independence but they are being constantly tested. Iraq has warmed to them greatly in fight against ISIS, without the Peshmerga taking the brunt of ISIS the whole country would have been over run. Iraq knows the Kurds saved their ass but Iraq also doesn't like their independent streak. They have been made to turn over control of oil fields and other areas as a form for the co-operation from Baghdad for help in their fight. They have an interesting history, which has changed over time but it's one that stems from basically genocide to save their way of life..... >The group was founded in 1978 in the village of Fis (near Lice) by a group of Kurdish students led by Abdullah Öcalan.[18] The PKK's ideology was originally a fusion of revolutionary socialism and Kurdish nationalism, seeking the foundation of an independent Communist state in the region, which was to be known as Kurdistan. The initial reasons given by the PKK for this were the oppression of Kurds in Turkey and Capitalism.[19][20] By then, the use of Kurdish language, dress, folklore, and names were banned in Kurdish-inhabited areas.[21] The words 'Kurds', 'Kurdistan', or 'Kurdish' were officially banned by the Turkish government temporarily.[22] Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life.[23] Many who spoke, published, or sang in Kurdish were arrested and imprisoned.[24] The PKK was then formed, as part of a growing discontent over the suppression of Turkey's ethnic Kurds, in an effort to establish linguistic, cultural, and political rights for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority.[25] Since the PKK's foundation, it has been involved in armed clashes with Turkish security forces. The full-scale insurgency, however, did not begin until 15 August 1984, when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising. Since the conflict began, more than 40,000 have died, most of whom were Turkish Kurdish civilians.[26] Since PKK leader Öcalan's capture and imprisonment in 1999, he has moved on from Marxism–Leninism,[27] leading the party to adopt his new political platform of democratic confederalism while ceasing its official calls for the establishment of a fully independent country. In May 2007, former members of the PKK helped form the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK), an umbrella organisation of Kurds from Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. In 2013, the PKK declared a ceasefire agreement and began slowly withdrawing its fighters to the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq as part of the solution process between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority. In July 2015, the PKK announced that a ceasefire was over and said that Ankara had welched on its promises regarding the Kurdish issue.[28] In August 2015, the PKK announced that they would accept another ceasefire with Turkey only under US guarantees.[29] So any Turkey involvement in Syria will mean Kurdish forces will have to retreat back to Iraq for safety. Kurdish forces at best are light infantry, they are extremely good at what they do but Turkey is a mechanized modern infanty and armored military power with an Air Force. They don't stand a chance.

"I wouldn't suggest a UBI without some sort of funding mechanism. Your insinuation is that I'm just adding a policy without a means to pay for it. I think there are a few different ideas to do that, but a VAT could be a very promising solution to pay for it at 10% which is half the European level. Solutions like UBI are being proposed primarily because of the reduction of jobs because of technology and automation. Furthermore Medicare and Medicaid are some of the biggest expenditures for the Federal government, are there any novel ideas there on how to reduce that? My sense is that with gene-editing technology improving rapidly and a host of therapies that deal with age related disease we could dramatically reduce the costs of end life care (much of the cost driver of Medicare). &#x200B; Science can dramatically improve our lives and it can also create dramatic change quickly. Federal spending will have to be reprioritized massively in the coming years because of these changes. UBI is a way to respond to the rapid unemployment we're facing because of technology.

"Getting government out of marriage entirely is pretty much necessary at this point to protect the first amendment. The left controls too many institutions. There's a lot of inability to understand things out there, some of it intentional. If the conservatives controlled institutions or if there was at least they were close to neutral then this wouldn't be the best approach. Of course, the government can and should define marriage as between one man and one woman. Society benefits from strong families with most children raised by a mother and a father. Society does not benefit from broken homes and it does not benefit from giving tax advantages intended for families to homosexual couples. Gays would be still allowed to marry the opposite gender as they've always been able to, so there would be no equal protection issue here. The government should also make it more difficult to get divorced, and we should probably rethink how we approach abortion and birth control. We should also bring about robust school choice. A colleague from Denmark was telling me that the money simply follows the student in his country and that he only pays the difference between the public contribution and the total tuition for his children's private school. Here, Parochial schools often cost a fraction of what government-run schools cost. School choice can and should be implemented. It would result in better quality education, cost less money, and actually serve to protect the first amendment by enabling more parents to send their children to a school with values that they approve of.

"I think they are both rising in popularity. White supremacy and communism are both on the rise. There is a concentrated effort to rebrand white supremacy as ' identitarian' to try and distance themselves from the toxic brand of white supremacy. Much like the effort for communists to rebrand as 'democratic socialists.' Communism's popularity rises and peaks with each generation hitting college. The appeal of a marxist utopia is rather appealing to college students, it was appealing to me for a semester my freshmen year after I took Intro to Philosophy, college writing, and world history. It lasted a whole winter break until I took accounting, econ, and calculus the next semester. College kids are naturally drawn to it because it makes the world more like college, which is what they know. The common running joke for decades now is 'you're a communist, sure, but wait until you graduate and start having to pay taxes' or 'show me a young conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart, show me a old liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.' These are common jokes/idioms because that's how it works. Most people, when they get out of college move on from communist ideals when faced the realities of life. The real issue, in my mind, is the rise of *populism* on both sides and the growing divide between the two wings. Sensible socialist solutions like single-payer healthcare are written off as 'communism gonna kill us all! death panels!' when it's a far cry from the end of the world communism. Much like sensible nationalist solutions such as sensible border security is written off as 'nationalism is going to kill us all! nazis! fascists!' when it is a far cry from end of the world fascism. The reality is neither of them are communist or nationalist, they are just solutions to problems. I know I changed topics heavy there; but I am trying to build to a conclusion to answer your original question about the disparity in how hammer and sickle tshirts vs kkk robes are handled. It seems to me that the rise of communism and fascism/white supremacy this generation is a result of stagnant wages, and a growing divide between the haves and the have nots. *(Disclaimer: The next part takes the assumption that wealthy people are to blame for society's woes, which is the common thread between the two populist movements. I don't believe this assumption is correct I'm just setting a framework of context.)* Both sides feel the weight of the 'elites' or the '1%.' The difference is who they put the blame on. Communists blame the people who hold all the capital. Fascists/White supremacists blame the Jews, because they think Jews hold all the capital, and are trying to control the global culture with 'cultural marxism' and immigration and white genocide. So to me, when I adopt the stances, aka 'put on the shoes,' of the people we are talking about, something I try to when I am making a judgement on character and intent, one side of that equation at least puts the blame on the right people. The other side is woefully and dangerously misguided, and are placing the blame on scapegoats created by people with power and money. I personally find them both to be rather idiotic, but I find one side of that equation to be more dangerous. One wants to dismantle power across the board (communists), the other wants to protect power, while eliminating that powers enemies for them (fascists). The kicker is that in practice, that is ultimately what both sides do - eliminate powerful people's enemies for them. But in the context of their common thread, 'in their shoes' I fear that it's more likely for someone to come along and prey on the fascists to do the dirty work than the communists. So to me, the objectively more likely outcome in this context is that fascists become a real threat. \----------- As a final note. I think that is society's belief as a whole; whether or not they understand why. I am, personally, glad there appears to be rational people who are standing up to communism as well. Just because I think it's a lesser threat, doesn't mean I don't think they need to be opposed. I'm just choosing to oppose right wing populism more. My sincere hope that is that reason prevails, and soon, and we start finding sensible solutions to problems before someone comes along and preys on one of the sides and we find ourselves in a real pickle; because the first people that go are the people in the middle talking reason.

This would alleviate all the Democrat concerns, but then race gets involved lots of people who go for voter a key like the idea that people of a different race will be disenfranchised. When a voter ID law comes up that you like why don't you contact your representatives and tell them you want it but with funding for ID cards to qualify? There are logical reasons to want this, but most the electorate that wants it to hurt other people. This is exactly what happened in South Dakota for this last election.

"**Information asymmetry** In contract theory and economics, information asymmetry deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other. This asymmetry creates an imbalance of power in transactions, which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry, a kind of market failure in the worst case. Examples of this problem are adverse selection, moral hazard, and monopolies of knowledge.Information asymmetry extends to non-economic behavior. International relations theory has recognized that wars may be caused by asymmetric information and that 'Most of the great wars of the modern era resulted from leaders miscalculating their prospects for victory'. *** **Market failure** In economics, market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, often leading to a net social welfare loss. Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian philosopher Henry Sidgwick. Market failures are often associated with time-inconsistent preferences, information asymmetries, non-competitive markets, principal–agent problems, or externalities.Public goods are both non-rival and non-excludable (i.e., public goods are not only non-excludable) thus existence of a market failure is often the reason that self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions intervene in a particular market. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a9zs0v,moderatepolitics

"I can't speak to society, but I can speak to my own reasoning as to why I call one out and not the other. The KKK was a real movement here in the United States where people terrorized black people under the guise of Christianity, largely because they rebelled over their perceived right to own other people and started a civil war where half a million Americans died - and lost. They felt their only course of action was to try and scare black people away, or back into subservience. They hid their identities under white robes partly because they knew what they were doing was not supported by the American population as a whole, and further to terrorize people into inaction out of fear of never knowing who was part of that movement. It's a wholly American phenomenon and serves as a horrible reminder of what people in our country can rationalize. It hits very close to home for a lot for people, including myself; and elicits an immediate sense of revulsion. &#x200B; Compare that to the Hammer and Sickle; which was a European, and Eastern European at that, movement that terrorized the American people through a cold war; leading to two generations of people spending the bulk of their lives in a constant state of stress over an unannounced, unstoppable instant death via nuclear war. This fear is fundamentally different than a fear that anyone you know could be in the KKK, and could overhear you speaking about black people's rights and decide that you also needed to be lynched. Over a thousand white people were lynched by the KKK, primarily as a method to prevent white people from openly allying with black people. &#x200B; The fear of cold war nuclear death by the soviets was a fear of a distant faceless enemy, the fear of the KKK was a fear of your ally and fellow countryman - a fear of betrayal. Further to the point, most people, including myself, don't think that college kids in a hammer and sickle shirt want to commit the atrocities that Stalin and Mao and Kim did. We think they are just to dumb to know, right now, that giving that much power to the state won't end well, and it certainly won't end in their dream of a stateless moneyless marxist utopia. To me, college kids in hammer and sickle shirts is as comparatively harmless as it always was. College kids have been wearing those shirts for 40 years, and millions have not died, and no real efforts to start a violent revolution have come to fruition. The closest we got was the weathermen - which was fucked up and widely condemned, even by the very kids in hammer and sickle shirts in the 60's. &#x200B; But if I were to see college kids in KKK robes, I do honestly think they will lynch someone, and soon, if left unchecked. I do honestly think the best course of action is to swiftly and immediately condemn and fight against that, lest it take roost again.",t3_a7byi8,moderatepolitics

"Lindsey Graham is bullshitting us for the sake of keeping us in Syria while trying to prevent Trump from being embarrassed. Basically, Trump said he was pulling out of Syria after the Turkish president asked him to. Trump did his without consulting any US military leaders. Almost everyone in leadership positions in US politics thinks this was a stupid thing to do. Belatedly, Trump sees that this was an extremely stupid thing he did, because almost nobody thinks he did the right thing. And he realizes that his presidency could literally be destroyed by this decision -- that Republican leaders would stop supporting him. So maybe Trump would like to walk back the decision, but would be embarrassed and shamed if he just came out and said 'whoops, I shouldn't have said we're pulling out of Syria.' So Lindsey Graham steps in and tells Trump 'I will tell the public that you are being careful and listening to your generals and slowing down the pull out of troops. And what we're actually doing is we're not pulling out at all and nothing has changed, and in the end your voters haven't really been paying attention to these details anyway.'

"I'll speak to the area that I know, the State of Utah, and the map seems reasonable for this. I actually live in the same zip code as one of the more urban zones in northern Utah. I'm from, and still have close connections to rural Utah, and I'm very familiar with many of the counties that are part of the rural counties. For the urban areas, the problem is that businesses don't want to locate in these areas because they are perceived as 'low income' or 'less developed'. The houses are older, smaller and there isn't open space to build newer, larger homes. So these homes get built in the open areas nearby, and the owners commute to Salt Lake City. Automobile pollution is the major contributor to really horrible air quality due to the fact that it's located in a valley surrounded by high mountains. The population is booming, but the transit system is lagging, so people drive. If small manufacturing and other blue-collar businesses could be located in these opportunity zones, then things would improve. It would be almost impossible for a real estate developer to make much money in the northern Utah zones because these locations have the only lower cost real estate in an area that is seeing a seriously nasty sellers market for real estate. I think the Governor and others chose well here. The rural counties, especially in central Utah, are hamstrung because there isn't the population to support manufacturing and they are isolated from consumers. No matter what you built there, it would have to be transported a long way to market. So light industry and niche manufacturing is almost impossible to start there. So, the only really viable industries are extraction industries taking advantage of the open land and the existing minerals. Food production, mining, drilling and waste holding industries are about the only anchor industries that could turn a profit. Without these industries, it's pretty impossible for real estate to improve at all. They need new jobs first. The main roadblock to this is that a lot of the land in these counties is owned by the Federal Government and administered by Forest Service, BLM and some Park Service sites. Any opening of any land for mining is usually vehemently opposed by environmentalist groups. These groups become unreasonably hysterical at nearly any provocation, so there is no possibility of negotiations. These groups are 'we want it all to stay undeveloped, for ever, so we can . . . we don't know . . . but just should.' That's the main roadblock for these places. I am seriously discouraged by the fact, though, that the Governor precisely excluded every county that has a Native American reservation on it. That's the one part I can't agree with at all.

"First, your positions sound very similar to mine and I'd advise you hop on over to r/ConservativeDemocrat to find likeminded people. More to the point, however, the solution to immigration is threefold. First, we must improve border security and the best way to do that is by better incorporating technology into what we currently have. For instance, drones could be used to cover massive areas of land. Second, we must have a more watertight immigration process because as its currently designed, immigrants are incentivized to risk breaking the law, not because they are criminals but because it offers them a better chance of being able to stay in this country. The Gang of Eight's bipartisan immigration reform would have solved many of the problems with the system but such reform needs to be passed politically, which in the case of the current Congress probably can't happen at all. The third thing is that we must have effective internal enforcement. As its currently administered and led, ICE is justifiably regarded as an anti-immigrant paramilitary rather than a legitimate government agency tasked with enforcing immigration standards. Their hiring standards are so lax, pretty much anyone can get in which has led to some horrifying stories including over 1000 cases of child sexual abuse. So ICE needs massive organizational and administrative changes. But it also needs a massive overhaul of its current policy which focuses on the immigrants themselves while virtually ignoring the real offenders, the corporations who hire them in defiance of the law. The current President's approach to this issue exacerbates the problems we're currently facing. The main solution he's offered is an extremely inefficient and virtually ineffective border wall that does little to actually regulate illegal immigration. And as for internal enforcement, the people he's appointed to run and manage the current system have been absolutely incompetent. They've implemented poor solutions to deal with the crisis (child separation, allowing standards to fall by focusing on quantity rather than quality) and rather than admitting their error have doubled down on the failed policies. Unfortunately, I'm not confident that Trump understands this because rather than firing the people who allowed this to get out of hand, he's doubled down and tried to defend them.

"The issue with trying to wipe away the ACA was twofold. One is that Democrats were never going to give up something that was the culmination of decades of effort. The Republicans overpromised when they aimed their base towards a full repeal. There is no way to produce a compromise out of that. The second issue is that despite its flaws, the ACA was a decent bill put together through a long, fairly open process that solved real problems. The Republicans never really thought enough about how its popular provisions would be preserved. They already made covering preexisting conditions hard by demonizing the mandate, which is a mechanism that has proven itself in other countries. So they had no idea how to achieve a promise that the Democrats vigorously opposed. No amount of spine is going to get that passed. If they had a good replacement put together, they might have gotten it passed. The border wall may have been a possibility once upon a time, but the last time Democrats offered a compromise for border wall funding Trump screwed them over.

Someone needs to be named so they can be indicted, perhaps we should call them the alleged co-conspirator but we know for a fact there was a co-conspirator and we only use 'alleged' to not accidentally be libelous against someone. In that case we would say 'Donald Trump allegedly co-conspired' or 'allegedly Donald Trump was the co-conspirator'.

"A costly reorganization at a private or public company is very different than a taxpayer-funded shutdown of the federal government.

But as a voting taxpayer, I have every right to voice my displeasure with the way the federal government is operating. “That’s life, hopefully you can find a new job” is an appropriate response to a handful of people being laid off.

"There are a lot of problems with your analogy. &#x200B; 1)Market size. Baseball cards and other such similar avenues (like Trading Card Games) were never that big of a market. Maybe they were/are a problem, but that problem was small enough that not enough people cared. Once something gets to be a big enough problem then part of the role of a modern government is to step in and regulate it to protect consumers, even if from themselves. &#x200B; 2) Physical access. Physical card collectibles generally require physical interaction to purchase and use. Yes the internet means that isn't true anymore for purchasing, but except for the rare person who just collects you still have the physical interaction component. While that may not prevent addictive behavior, it does provide some safeguards. Hard to be interested in physical card games if no one else is around to play them with you (same with showing off baseball cards or what not). There are dozens of ways addictive behavior can be curbed or seen and potentially dealt with before it becomes a problem once you actually have to get face to face with others. &#x200B; Another aspect to this is that video games are a constantly available access, anytime and anywhere. You don't have to visit a game store or go looking online and waiting a few days or more to recieve the product after you've ordered it. You just power on your device of choice from the comfort of your bed/couch/chair and go. School, work, traveling, shopping in a store, eating, etc... &#x200B; 3) Financial control. While more relevant to children than adults, although still relevant, the fact is that it's really easy to purchase loot boxes in a lot of cases. All a person has to do save their credit card with Steam, Battlenet, Origins, Apple, Google, whatever and then you can make purchases at your first uncontrolled whim. Most places have safeguards to require a password or some other authentication but those are ineffective in a lot of cases because people are stupid or lazy, assuming they even use them in the first place.

"Why would Google want to serve fake news? Even places with only a mild conservative mean like Fox News have to be pretty dishonest to get there. There are some conservative news outlets that get there somewhat more honestly, but even then they have to lie by omission. There's a bunch of good reasons why most of Europe, Canada, Japan, and a ton of other places have a lot of liberal policies and they're succeeding, they largely work when not taken to extremes. Things like renewable energy, preserving the environment, tolerance to people of all races, universal health care, and taking basic measures to prevent kids from being shot in school have done a bunch of good work and these other countries. Touting trumps policy on coal, means ignoring all the successes and solar and wind energy. It also means ignoring the fact that coal is still shrinking and not very profitable. Being for the wall, for tear gassing immigrants, against helping Puerto Rico, or against people kneeling nonviolently in protest pretty much means being racist. I've had the aid Puerto Rico argument a huge number of times and no one has been able to tell me why Trump was unwilling to deploy an aircraft carrier to power hospitals, the only reason I can think is racism. The preponderance of his base doesn't like Puerto Ricans. I think was only recently a lot of them learn Puerto Ricans were American citizens. When we see Fox News cover these stories, they always blame the brown people and try to make Trump look good. Even the Koch brothers did a study, but they subsequently tried to bury, it showed that universal health Care would save a ton of money for everyone except the insurance industry. Last I checked we were something like 60th or 70th and terms of quality of healthcare, and among industrialized nations the only nation with a declining life expectancy. We spend many times more per person than any other industrialized country and get worse results than most of them. If you are supporting Trump at the moment, you have to be opposed to fixing this. If conservative news outlets are to report on health care then they need to not use the fact that there are 50 or more countries with cheaper health care and better results. Some huge percentage of the electorate supports some kind of gun control, no one wants people bringing guns in the schools and shooting kids. But at present the Republican stance is to do nothing, I'm not saying I know what the right answer is but I'm fairly certain nothing isn't it. We have an order of magnitude more gun violence than any European country, and even including their knife violence it just doesn't make up for it. Guns make certain crimes way too easy, and when combined with our lack of access to free and easy mental health care we're just asking for problems. Conservative news outlets have to simultaneously be against free healthcare for the mentally ill, and pro guns when analyzed the stance just doesn't make a whole lot of sense and in order to get there with sources there needs to be a lot of lies by omission. At present groups like Fox News, Infowars, Breitbart, and a bunch of others that are even less reputable somehow have been put in a position where they have to oppose these things.

"I'm not the commenter you're asking, but the second half of your question doesn't make sense. There's no such thing as 'district lines drawn by population numbers alone' - there are a multitude of ways to draw districts by population numbers, so population numbers 'alone' cannot determine how districts are drawn. They're a constraint on how districts can be drawn, but far from sufficient for drawing actual lines. It also doesn't make sense to ask about removing 'districting', since districts do need to be determined somehow, and that changes after each census. That's called 'redistricting', it adjusts the districts to the new population distribution, and it's necessary. Removing gerrymandering is not at all the same as removing redistricting. If you asked 'do you support removing all gerrymandering' I think that commenter would say yes, and I say yes as well. You could further ask 'how' if you want to know how they would do it. But we have some decent answers from states like Iowa and California. You can end gerrymandering by having a nonpartisan professional redistricting commission, whose members aren't representing parties or ideologies, and aren't running for office. Some people have proposed using software to draw districts, and there is software that can take a number of criteria and priorities and census data and draw districts. But you can't run it on autopilot. First of all, people need to set the criteria. For example, what's more important, compactness of districts, or adhering to city and county lines and natural features (such as rivers) to make districts more comprehensible to voters? Secondly, even if you set sensible criteria, there may be multiple equivalently good options, and there may be some significant problems the software wouldn't catch. In fact, redistricting commissions (and courts) can and do use software to draw districts, but human oversight over the process is still needed. What's important is that the people running the software, and accepting its results, aren't partisan and don't have a conflict of interest (which they would if they were elected officials or running for office, in which case the districts would personally affect their campaigns). Iowa is a great example because they've had a good redistricting process for a long time, and it eliminates gerrymandering. Their redistricting commission members must not 'hold partisan public office or an office in a political party, and none may be a relative or employee of a federal or state legislator (or the legislature as a whole).' The law tells them to draw districts meeting some standards and criteria: * Districts must be 'convenient and contiguous.' * Districts must 'preserve the integrity of political subdivisions like counties and cities.' * Districts must 'to the extent consistent with other requirements, [be] reasonably compact–defined in terms of regular polygons, comparisons of length and width, and overall boundary perimeter.' * State House districts are required to be contained within state Senate districts 'where possible, and where not in conflict with the criteria above.' * District lines cannot be drawn 'to favor a political party, incumbent, or other person or group.' (There is a flaw in the Iowa law. The legislature can reject the map drawn by the commission. If they reject three commission-drawn maps in a row, the legislature is the allowed to draw their own map. If Iowa ever gets infected by a majority of the kind of ridiculous over-the-line Republicans that states like North Carolina and Wisconsin have been infected by, they could gerrymander by repeatedly rejecting the commission-drawn map. That has never happened so far in Iowa, but it is a loophole in their existing law. I would improve the law by eliminating that loophole. An alternative might be that if you can get a finding of fact by the courts that the map from the commission fails to meet the standards set in the law, and this happens to three maps in a row, maybe some commission members can be replaced, but they have to meet the same standards and follow the same rules.)",t3_a28m1p,moderatepolitics

But I doubt it'll ever happen again, as I believe you might be underselling Obama's performance a bit...as for most of his points, it's hard to find a way to disagree as a reasonable person. He was effortlessly charismatic and more importantly, he presented his points strongly, clearly, and in great detail...and without malice and without demagoguery, which was in sharp contrast to the intellectually-dishonest arguments posed by Republicans. He even personally and respectfully took Paul Ryan to task for his inconsistent positions. Overall, he made the GOP look so bad, that I remember contemporaneous reports that Republicans would never agree to such a televised forum again. Such a shame more people didn't have an opportunity to watch, as it was a great example of exactly the type of reality- and fact-based reasonable discourse that has been missing in this country.

They also don't apologize for President Trump's ridiculous statements and actions, which is refreshing from conservative personalities. However they do praise him when he does things they agree with. Very even-handed imo. I disagree with a lot of their opinions, especially the social conservative ones, but find it interesting to hear their arguments, which make logical sense.

People (media) always seem to leave that part out..' People 'leave that part out' because it's an entirely different sentence and not the one they're quoting.

"While you're correct on comparing across industries, people don't use that when they reference this wage gap colloquially—they use it to imply that a man makes n+x dollars for every n dollars a woman makes, with the implication that it refers to the same job. But unfortunately these statistics have for quite a while included jobs across industries, which isn't quite fair when we see women dominate the lowest-opportunity college programs and men the highest-opportunity ones. When comparing at par (degree, years experience, job position), there tends to be no wage gap.

We are now seeing evidence from Cohen's indictment among others that this was obviously a fairy tale and that Trump was always deeply involved in his campaign. Connection made. As to 'slap on the wrist campaign violations', Cohen is serving three years in Federal prison for campaign violations and that was reduced from five years and three months because he cooperated with investigators. If you consider five+ years in Federal prison to be a slap on the wrist, then so be it.

So roughly 2.5% of that would be border crossers in the last 5 years, representing roughly about 3.5 billion of that seemingly inflated 135 billion number. Even rounding it up to account for newer people being more likely to need services, when you figure that's over 5 years, stopping 100% of those border crossings would likely save no more than a billion a year per year it's in place.

"You also missed my point. I will rephrase it. Political support for politician is an action. You go, you vote. Not something that is solely belief. Therefore it is not the same as private worship of Religion. While Religious worship has been connected to Political power, it is not a requirement for faith. It can be used, but not a requirement. I can believe in the flying Spaghetti monster and not take any political action. Now lets take a look at your Arguments. You make the argument that political belief is isolationist. That it only effects the individual. You also argue that associating those with certain political leanings with greater actions is bigotry. I agree. However, only to an extent. When extreme political actions are taken by the group's leader begin to form a pattern, for example. >There is little doubt in my mind most the things that cause your deep rooted hatred of Trump are based on misinformation. Don't get me wrong I'm sure you would always oppose his politics but its the deep hatred I'm talking about. The fact that you let that hatred spill over to people who support him is just sad in my opinion Once a politician begins to display extreme measures or views, we have to begin to look at the actions others took to get that person into power. Trump did not walk up and claim the Presidency. People voted for him. An action, not passive belief. It is not a stretch to say that those who voted and continue support at least in part hold that his actions are acceptable. Trump is the President of the United States, this means he is head of his party, the Republican party. He is their leader. However, I do not lump in all Republicans with him, only those that have continued to support him. You also make the argument that because of the structure of the U.S political system, Trumps actions are limited. >and what if someone understands that the President doesn't have the power to impose their morals and decision making on hundreds of millions of people due to the checks and balances of our federal government? The American Political system does attempt to defuse power between various offices, however, the head of the executive branch is by far the single most powerful person. And has the ability to pardon and directly bi-pass sections of the Judaical branch, for example. The ability to levee Tariffs is another, very powerful tool. The War powers act another example. Here we see the ability to bi pass the Judaical, the legislative, and excise military power with out approval from congress. The fact that executive branch has grown in power over the past century is a debate book all by itself. >People like Trump hate criminals for their actions. 'hate is what we need when dealing with criminals' is what Trump says. I contest this. Trump's behavior before taking office and after are consistent. He only 'Hates criminals' so far as they are not from certain groups. For Example, his pardon of Joe Arpaio. While I admit that all Presidents exercise this power in ways that are frankly questionable, I find this case to be telling of Trump's character. Arpaio had faced accusations of cruel and unusual punishment by many rights groups, specially on how he treated immigrants of South American ethnicity in prison conditions. He was the first person Trump pardoned, and explicitly had pardoned him before his sentencing. Joe Arpaio and Trump share certain... views. On former President Obama. There is also his handling of the unite the right rally. I looked into that quite a bit. The accusations that the media cherry picked his quote. True, but did not clear him from from many of the accusations. I found his language during that whole affair to be manipulative, purposely vague, and not at all clear and concise. I believe he dodged the question of condemning the rally. And again is telling of his character. Trump only seems to reserve energy and extreme rhetoric for those he deems to not be among the sociably acceptable. An example; his handling of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. In his statement, he directly accused Jamal Khashoggi of being a member of the Muslim Brother hood. No proof given. I did not get this from an article. I read Trump's response first. Would he had made the same accusation if Jamal Khashoggi was of another ethnicity?  Trump is consistent in how he views certain groups and He is consistently takes extreme measures to promote those he shares those views with (Joe Arpaio). Using these examples, Trumps actions are not consistent with someone who only judges people based on actions. After a while, while his extreme actions continue to grow in number, we have to assume those that voted for him and are not denouncing him still support him, and thus support his views and actions. It has strayed from being tolerable to being completely unacceptable in about a year. Perhaps because more people view these actions as 'normal' when they are not. We tolerate the enablers that elected him but tolerance is not acceptance, and acceptance becomes impossible at some point through actions taken by their chosen leader.

">Things become more challenging with PayPal, but there are a number of startups that still exist (Stripe and Square can fill that void from my limited knowledge). I just want to address this part from the standpoint of someone who works in credit card processing and helps businesses find processors. PayPal not allowing a business to use it is not something I would consider a big challenge. The fact is that people only know by name a few processing companies, but there are so many options that if something is legal, there's a processor that supports it, usually many processors. In some cases, the processor considers it higher risk for them to provide services to that business, and if that's the case, a business will have to pay more to compensate for that risk. (This is no different than a bank lending money to a subprime borrower. The bank sees them as riskier, and thus they get higher interest rates.) But PayPal (and Stripe and Square) 1) don't even directly offer merchant accounts, they essentially sublet their own and 2) exclusively deal with low risk businesses. They're very risk-averse. For example, the fact that they don't allow firearm sales isn't a political decision - it's because firearms are considered high risk in cc processing and they would have to do more work. That term applies to anything with complicating factors, like higher than average chargebacks, varied state and federal laws, age-restricted items, goods/services purchased well in advance, etc. So while 'high risk' includes things you may expect, like firearms, adult entertainment, gambling, tobacco, etc. it also includes stuff you probably wouldn't, like travel, tech support, and SaaS. They're also not even a drop in the bucket compared to the big processors, but for whatever reason, they have the name recognition. People get up in arms over PayPal/Square/Stripe banning various companies (that I'm frankly surprised they were supporting in the first place) and think it's an indication that the business is being blacklisted from credit card processing. It's not really the case, from anything I've seen. ",t3_a78fij,moderatepolitics

Trump told the military that other people tried to give them less, and the percentages he said that were lowballs were higher than what *congress* actually got them, and much higher than what he originally proposed. The only person who tried to give them less was Trump. According to your own sources. So not only did Trump lie, he took credit for something he didn't do, and what he didn't do was less than he told them he did. Trump's lies are so extreme, he's lying about lying.

Sure did pander to some big special interests though. hostages back from N Korea  Obama had 10 sent home during his time in office. He also didn’t give himself repeated pats on the back over it in a very obvious political stunt. Not to mention the Iran hostages and many more during his time as POTUS. a N Korea denuclearization pact,  Not going quite as planned. Denuclearisation is great but trump also dismantled the Iran deal which not only undid the work Obama did actually pursuing gains in pacifying the attempts of a Iran to pursue nuclear weapons but also spoke loud and clear to the world that American deals aren’t as good as the paper they are written on. Which has caused irrevocable harm to future negotiations for denuclearisation globally and otherwise. But that doesn’t read as well as your zingy one liner about an imaginary denuclearisation pact with a country who had nearly all of its nuclear scientists die in an accident and the test site ans facility unusable   China to crack down on fentanyl that kills 30k Americans a year This is just silly now.  Overdose deaths still growing and hitting record highs every year. Unprecedented. And trump has done nothing to meaningfully quell the crisis. He's the most incompetent white supremecist in history with minorities reaching historically low unemployment under his racist regime. It’s so incredibly lazy to just throw out numbers like unemployment, give trump a pat on the back and not give a lick of context. Only the most devoted shill and worshipper would do this. Name me 5 things trump has done to directly affect minority unemployment. Let alone the claim he has been the driving cause of the lowest minority unemployment numbers. Let’s also ignore that America hit huge unemployment levels during Obama’s takeover from Bush following the 2008 recession and thanks directly to actions taken by the Obama admin begin to decline steadily for years straight into Trumps presidency where they continue to go down to record levels. Trump has enjoyed the handoff of a steadily recovering economy but all signs point to a slowdown and crash.  Trumps job numbers are also not looking so hot right now. But that said there are a myriad of factors that affect unemployment. You might try to argue that the record low unemployment for mjnorities was brought on by trump’s tax cuts, but that would ignore a steady decline in unemployment charging well into the Obama recovery. There was no uptick in unemployment decreases after the tax cuts and in fact as the tax cuts take hold we’re actually seeing growth and unemployment decreases slow down, job numbers taking a major hit, and the future prospects look pretty grim. But don’t worry I’m sure it’ll all fall apart just in time for a democrat to come in and try to clean this mess up. Much to your chagrin. He can't even crash an economy if his life depended on it with record high median household incomes and consumer/manufacturing confidence. Ah yes, median household income and consumer confidence. The two only barometers of whether an economy is booming or not. Nothing I love more than the median income myth trump loves to drive. Once again trump is claiming credit for trends that were ongoing years before he took office. In 2015 median household income grew 5.1% 2016 - 3.1% 2017 - 1.8% And by this study from Brookings real wage growth has hovered around zero. And the future outlook is incredibly bleak with the only prospect of further wage increases unless we see growth from real hourly wages. A viewpoint trump and the GOP seem to disagree with.  Despite being in a supposed “boom” and having fiscally conservative GOP running the show the deficit has exploded. And not with temporary stimulus like during Obama but permanently the deficit has been jacked up from the tax cuts and it’s only going to get worse.  The trade war has been awful and only served to hurt American consumers.  An IMF report that Among advanced economies only the US stands to increase its debt to GDP ratio Over the next 5 years  Trump is running trillion dollar deficits. A disaster.  The stock market also shows clear signs that investors are preparing for a crash. “The Fed has been pumping liquidity into the economy via its massive quantitative easing bond-buying program, which still holds around $4 trillion of debt. That’s about to be sucked out as the central bank raises interest rates and reduces its bond balance sheet, creating volatility, says Mark Yusko, chief executive and chief investment officer at Morgan Creek Capital Management. That will also weigh on risky assets like stocks that are already overbought, he added,. “Liquidity drives markets and liquidity is shifting,” Yusko said at the Inside Smart Beta conference last week in New York. “We’re in a new liquidity cycle, we’re in a new liquidity regime and it’s going to be negative for risk assets and that is just what it is.” Yusko also says that investor behavior is pointing to another downturn as buyers pile into popular stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), the so-called FAANG stocks, and passive investment vehicles, looking to cash in on the market upswing. “With all this money in cap-weighted indices, it’s not different than 2000, no different than 2007,” Yusko said.”  Trump is a special kind of idiot, so utterly incompetent he even fails at failing.

"TL;dr Don't hurt people. Don't take their stuff. This applies to both individuals and organizations, including government. My answer, from 'First Principles of Liberty' on my criminal justice reform blog : Let's begin from first principles. Every person has the absolute right to their own body; you own yourself. No one else has the right to own you. This is the right of self-ownership, and it is the basis of all human rights. Thomas Jefferson says we have the right to life. If others own us, if others have the power of life and death over us, we are denied our right to self-ownership. Since I own my body, I have the right to decide what to do with it. It's mine. No one else has the right to do so without my consent. This is the right of self-determination. Thomas Jefferson says we have the right to liberty. If others have the power to control our actions, we are denied our right to self-determination. Since I own my body and am the sole determiner of its actions, I also own the product of my labor. No one else has the right to demand labor from me. This is the right to property, which Jefferson replaced with the right to pursue happiness, because he didn't want slave owners thinking they had a right to own people. (Of course, Jefferson was a slave owner himself, and didn't do a very good job of living up to the ideals he wrote down. They're still good ideals.) If others have the power to confiscate our belongings, we are denied our right to property. So every person has these rights, inherently. Inherent means existing in something as a permanent, essential, or characteristic attribute. One cannot separate these rights from a person, because these rights are part of person-hood. To deny these rights is to deny basic humanity. Because these rights are inherent in all persons, they cannot be granted by the state. They may be recognized and enumerated for protection by a benevolent state, they may be ignored and infringed by tyrannical dictators, but they exist independent of the state. The only restriction on the exercise of your rights is that you do not infringe on the rights of others. You may not kill or harm people, because this violates their right to life. You may not enslave people, because this violates their right to liberty. And you may not steal from people, because this violates their right to property. From this, we derive the non-aggression principle, which succintly states that no person may initiate force against another person. This, then, is the only crime: to initiate force against another person, depriving them of life, liberty, or property. A government exists to use force. It funds itself through force. If its power expands beyond using that force to protect the rights of the people, it must be checked. And if it uses its power to deprive the people of life, liberty, and property, then it is no longer fulfilling the legitimate role of a government, but rather that of a criminal cartel. *** The Statement of Principles of the Libertarian Party of the United States: We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual. We hold that all individuals have the right to exercise sole dominion over their own lives, and have the right to live in whatever manner they choose, so long as they do not forcibly interfere with the equal right of others to live in whatever manner they choose. Governments throughout history have regularly operated on the opposite principle, that the State has the right to dispose of the lives of individuals and the fruits of their labor. Even within the United States, all political parties other than our own grant to government the right to regulate the lives of individuals and seize the fruits of their labor without their consent. We, on the contrary, deny the right of any government to do these things, and hold that where governments exist, they must not violate the rights of any individual: namely, (1) the right to life—accordingly we support the prohibition of the initiation of physical force against others; (2) the right to liberty of speech and action—accordingly we oppose all attempts by government to abridge the freedom of speech and press, as well as government censorship in any form; and (3) the right to property—accordingly we oppose all government interference with private property, such as confiscation, nationalization, and eminent domain, and support the prohibition of robbery, trespass, fraud, and misrepresentation. Since governments, when instituted, must not violate individual rights, we oppose all interference by government in the areas of voluntary and contractual relations among individuals. People should not be forced to sacrifice their lives and property for the benefit of others. They should be left free by government to deal with one another as free traders; and the resultant economic system, the only one compatible with the protection of individual rights, is the free market.

An extremely high bar because Trump is not a lawyer and thus is expected to heed the advice of counsel. If counsel never advised that what Trump was asking for was illegal and there's no evidence Trump knew, he's in the clear of legal consequences. That said, it's not a good look for the President to surround himself with so many people that appear to have been engaged in illegal activity. I suspect this is playing into his difficulty in finding a new chief of staff and if it continues will likely bleed into his ability fill other positions in the future. This is a dangerous time for the president. He needs to be mindful that anyone he removes at this point could add to a chorus of former associates who say less than good things about him.

But public schools are public property, so at that point... Who gets to say what? Would have to fall to the school's discretion at that point. Blocking roads and entrances can fall under public safety clauses, similar to yelling fire in a crowded space with there being a fire. But these rights have been held up at times too. Sit ins are a notable example. If students wish to sit in an auditorium where the speaker is to be, and refuse to leave.... It is then *up to the school* to decide if they want to remove them. The case law does not permit police to be used to remove the students, unless the property owner wishes it to be so - so back to the public school issue. Again, it will fall to school policy.

"Remittances to Mexico . A tax on these that could fund the border wall in a reasonable amount of time would be around 10%, and would probably do the following: * Reduce Latino support for the GOP - Despite what Trump might say, a tax on remittances is _still an extra tax on American citizens and legal residents_, not a tax on Mexicans or Mexico. I would see any attempt to tax remittances to a specific country as an inherently racist policy. Taxes on remittances in general are pretty anti-immigrant. * Feed cartel operations - I would expect that if an extra 10% tax is instituted, we will see a lot of people start laundering money instead of paying it, especially when the people paying the tax do not agree with where the money is going. Unfortunately, there are plenty of ready-made laundering pipelines already crossing the border and they are all run by cartels.",t3_a9gym8,moderatepolitics
"I can well imagine a reasonably objective set of criteria to meet: any news source included in the aggregation algorithm would have to 1) havea code of ethics that meets some basic criteria for “principles of truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, impartiality, fairness, and public accountability, as these apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public.” (lazy wiki copypaste), and 2) be seen to adhere to that code. Would it be simple? No, nor foolproof. But it would be a vast improvement on the current state (“Be prepared to meet your GALACTIC OVERLORDS! Scientists say an alien invasion may be weeks away”). No news outlet can be bias-free; that doesn’t mean all bets are off and any old made-up shit is news.

"Clinton wasn’t impeached over the blowjob, he was impeached because he lied to Congress about the blowjob because there was a civil suit over other sexual harassment claims going on at the time and he didn’t want statements confirming the blowjob to be able to establish a pattern on behavior. Impeachment was for perjury and obstruction, which is what some of the Mueller indictments are over right now. So there’s strong precedent for impeachment for perjury and obstruction. Now as far as Trump is concerned, Russiagate could lead to similar impeachment charges. The incompetence side of things has no precedence in the United States, but the 25th amendment does sort of provide justification for this. It’s never happened before, though. What does this get called? Impeachment? Not sure Congress can even pull the lever, the amendment specifically says the Vice President and majority of principal officers of executive departments need to make the call.

Weirdly, the sources it does give right after that seem to counter their argument.

In my opinion, the best way to see what the founding fathers meant is to look back and see how they handle cannons. Those were military only, and roughly equivalent to a rocket launcher or grenade. The fact is that [yes, people were allowed to own cannons] ( So basically, just because a restriction comes from the supreme court doesn't mean it's not a restriction. I think it makes sense that rocket launcher aren't allowed, but I could also see a future where that isn't the case.

"If you think you don't live in a two party system then you are honestly strategically clueless. That's why I mentioned game theory too, people absolutely vote strategically and weigh who can win before they select who to vote for. That's why no matter what they do the major third parties have *never* made any gains on their low single digit results. The best they can ever hope for is a scenario where they put forward a particularly good candidate while their closest ideological neighbour puts forward an especially bad one, in which case they gain an irrelevant single digit percentage increase that is completely erased as soon as their ideological neighbour puts forward even a mediocre candidate in the next cycle. This is of course because almost everyone intuitively understands that voting third party in a first past the post system helps whichever major party they disagree with the most. That's the game theory aspect and why a viable third party will never, *ever* happen without electoral reform, because every step closer that you get to getting enough people to vote for your third party means the person you disagree with the most wins a bigger and bigger landslide until you *finally* get literally like 50 million plus people on board to win. The idea that that many people will jump off a cliff together when as 49.999 million they all die together and only as 50 million they all take flight is literally insane. Please learn game theory, if you actually believe just telling people to vote third party will lead to a third party candidate becoming president in the next 500 years you are expressing a view so illiterate of game theory that you might as well say that you can get to the number 1000 by counting downwards because if you keep going down you get to the lowest number and it flips over to positive numbers. Even if you somehow achieved the impossible like this, all that would happen is the collapse of the ideologically neighbouring party with everyone switching over to the third party that is actually now the second party, bringing all their ideological values and potential candidates with them. If that didn't happen you'll never get enough of a coalition together to do anything other than ensure whoever you hate the most wins over and over and over while you'll fight it out.

Now that it is Trump that is in trouble, many conservatives are worried about the power of law enforcement, and the liberal minded people are silent because it is helping to get information about Trump's campaign. As someone that has always cared about the principal of law enforcement being able to spy on citizens with fisa warrents, and how the public isn't able to get information about the tactics of law enforcement, and how there is no oversight to make sure that they are doing things right.

"I just stumbled on this organization, which you may also appreciate:  **ABOUT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF NONPARTISAN REFORMERS** *THE PREAMBLE* We, as individuals and/or representatives of organizations, in order to foster a government that is representative of and responsive to the people, are dedicated to advancing reforms and causes that increase competition, participation, and accountability in our political system. The Democratic and Republican parties have created institutional barriers to insulate themselves from these reforms. The absence of a competitive political system denies voters fair and equitable access to their government. Such absence of access further denies candidates for elected office any reasonable capacity to freely express their opinions, offer such opinions for consideration of the electorate, or otherwise impact the course of public policy. Further, the destruction of electoral competition diminishes the role of innovation in our political discourse, including within the Republican and Democratic parties, replacing the historic focus on new ideas in the American public square with the specter of the two parties’ prevailing views. We further recognize that the remedy to our unrepresentative and unresponsive government is to credibly challenge the institutionalized advantages that transfer control of the electoral process from the people to the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties, and we resolve to mount that challenge. In our common pursuit of this right and essential objective, we support the establishment of a formal Association of nonpartisan, reform-oriented organizations and individuals that can facilitate shared resources, establish common objectives, and promote general efforts to provide more choice to voters and better representation to every citizen of the United States regardless of their party affiliation or non-affiliation.",t3_a8lva3,moderatepolitics

But the moment he starts demanding radical revisions to visa programs and major cuts to legal immigration pathways then he’s going to lose most Democrats and many Republicans — especially if he’s not willing to give anything up to make up for those reductions.

For example, yes Reddit wouldn't be concerned with a far right politician complaining about business, because a far right ideology also (often) embraces things like nationalism and hardline religious social conservatism, so these other factors drown out reasonable concern about business issues.

"I'd just add that in my opinion, the key to this dichotomy between the two men is not really rooted in President Obama's charisma and uncanny ability to make persuasive and well-reasoned arguments (although that's obviously a plus), it's that his arguments are extraordinary nuanced and influenced by facts and universal realities. He rarely makes unfounded assertions and frequently caveats his statements to conform to the available evidence basis. And when he doesn't (e.g. 'you can keep your doctor,' which was a statement he admittedly much later clarified more accurately), he was roundly criticized. Not sure what to make of Trump's approval ratings in light of this, but imagine it might have to do with the fact that the attributes that make Obama such an effective leader require long-form communication, the appetite for which is increasingly rare in the media and in our society at-large. Trump and the GOP--as highlighted by the linked video here--along with many Democratic reactionaries too, to be fair, have largely abandoned such nuance and context in favor of Twitter and demagogued soundbites. If people don't have access to, opportunity for, or sadder-still, interest in longer-form communication/debate...well, then that's sorta how we got to where we are today.

"Revelant post from u/FactCheckHuman : From the official White House  the DoD reports that in March 2018, Trump signed a bill which authorizes a '$160 billion boost in defense spending over two years.' If the final 2018 bill was $700 billion then, and if this new $160 billion 'boost' is subdivided over two years, then this may actually be where Trump is getting the (roughly) 10% number—'more than 10 percent,' as said—for the 2019 defense budget.

This would make it so the legislature must be allowed to defend the law; it wouldn't be at the judge's discretion.

"Here’s an attempt at a more thorough answer. Am on phone, so apologies for formatting gaffes. First off, what are we calling “socialism”? A dictionary will tell you it’s “government control of the means of production”, i.e. industries, i.e. anything that makes money. This is clearly not an all-or-nothing issue. While you can have complete and total government control of the means of production, and you can also have none at all, you can just as easily have a small amount, or a large amount. So the extent to which a country is socialist is the extent to which it has government control over the means of production. When we then say “X country *is* socialist”, we actually mean “X country has crossed some significant threshold of the amount of government control over the means of production”. It best to illustrate this with an analogy. Imagine that each country has a blank piece of paper, and a set of red crayons. Each country then has to decide how much of the paper they want to colour in. This analogy has intentionally abstracted away from all the economic concerns, making it sound like a matter of mere preference — in reality, of course, it’s a lot more complicated than that. Well, assuming the colour red is equivalent to government control over the means of production, things would look like this: Venezuela would have almost a completely red piece of paper. Somalia’s paper would basically be completely blank. The US would have a slightly red, but not very, piece of paper; let’s say it’s 10% red. The UK’s paper is about 15% red. The Scandinavian countries have quite a bit of red, but still not a huge amount — let’s say 30%. To actually answer your question, here is how I’d characterise the positions of mainstream American politicians using this analogy: Most Republicans want, at the very least, to ditch the crayons. Some also want to erase some of the red currently on the paper. The “centre-left”, “establishment” Democrats like Obama and Clinton want to colour it in a little bit. They don’t know how much, they just know they’d prefer a bit more red on the paper. That’s also why they propose colouring in only a little bit at a time, because they don’t want to suddenly colour in too much at once and they know how hard it can be to erase excessive crayon. In general, they’re still big fans of the white part of the paper. What I’d call a “normal left” Democrat is someone like Elizabeth Warren. They operate under broadly the same principles as the centre-lefts, but they see it as a more urgent matter to colour in at least a little a bit of the paper. They may also have a more specific aim as to how much paper they’d like coloured in (say, 15%). However, they definitely still want a mostly blank piece of paper. Bernie Sanders, and the “social democrats”, are people who look at the Scandinavian countries, and think “damn, that looks perfect”. So they advocate for the US to get close to that amount of red. Note that 30% is still not close to majority red. They still want most of the paper to be white, but they also want quite a lot of the paper to be red because they like how the Scandinavian paper looks. Finally, AOC and the “democratic socialists” are people who want to end up with huge swathes of red, let’s say 75%. They really do believe in the colour red. Even so, they brand themselves as “democratic socialists” because they realise that it’ll take a lot of crayon to colour the paper in that much, that most of the country strongly prefers the colour white, and that they can only get to that level slowly, one bout of colouring in at a time. So is the country getting more socialist? Kinda. But no one mainstream wants a full-on, blood red Venezuela yet. It’s more like people are getting bored of a mostly blank piece of paper, and want to give red a try. What I also hope to illustrate from this reply is how distant the gaps are between the various “left” politicians. I noticed that you put Bernie and AOC in the same camp, as a lot of people do.

"First, from the video linked by OP: You’re absolutely right that when I was sworn in the hope was that unemployment would remain around 8 [percent], or in the 8 percent range. That was just based on the estimates made by both conservative and liberal economists, because at that point not all the data had trickled in. We had lost 650,000 jobs in December. I’m assuming you’re not faulting my policies for that. We had lost, it turns out, 700,000 jobs in January, the month I was sworn in. I’m assuming it wasn’t my administration’s policies that accounted for that. We lost another 650,000 jobs the subsequent month, before any of my policies had gone into effect. So I’m assuming that wasn’t as a consequence of our policies; that doesn’t reflect the failure of the Recovery Act. The point being that what ended up happening was that the job losses from this recession proved to be much more severe — in the first quarter of last year going into the second quarter of last year — than anybody anticipated. So I mean, I think we can score political points on the basis of the fact that we underestimated how severe the job losses were going to be. But those job losses took place before any stimulus, whether it was the ones that you guys have proposed or the ones that we proposed, could have ever taken into effect. Now, that’s just the fact, Mike, and I don’t think anybody would dispute that. You could not find an economist who would dispute that. Now, at the same time, as I mentioned, most economists — Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative — would say that had it not been for the stimulus package that we passed, things would be much worse. Now, they didn’t fill a 7 million hole in the number of people who were unemployed. They probably account for about 2 million, which means we still have 5 million folks in there that we’ve still got to deal with. That’s a lot of people. The package that we put together at the beginning of the year, the truth is, should have reflected — and I believe reflected what most of you would say are common sense things. This notion that this was a radical package is just not true. A third of them were tax cuts, and they weren’t — when you say they were “boutique” tax cuts, Mike, 95 percent of working Americans got tax cuts, small businesses got tax cuts, large businesses got help in terms of their depreciation schedules. I mean, it was a pretty conventional list of tax cuts. A third of it was stabilizing state budgets. There is not a single person in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimulus package, wouldn’t be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid off, more cops laid off. A big chunk of it was unemployment insurance and COBRA, just making sure that people had some floor beneath them, and, by the way, making sure that there was enough money in their pockets that businesses had some customers. You take those two things out, that accounts for the majority of the stimulus package. Are there people in this room who think that was a bad idea? A portion of it was dealing with the AMT, the alternative minimum tax — not a proposal of mine; that’s not a consequence of my policies that we have a tax system where we keep on putting off a potential tax hike that is embedded in the budget that we have to fix each year. That cost about $70 billion. And then the last portion of it was infrastructure which, as I said, a lot of you have gone to appear at ribbon-cuttings for the same projects that you voted against. Now, I say all this not to re-litigate the past, but it’s simply to state that the component parts of the Recovery Act are consistent with what many of you say are important things to do — rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for families and businesses, and making sure that we were providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in. And the notion that I would somehow resist doing something that cost half as much but would produce twice as many jobs — why would I resist that? I wouldn’t. I mean, that’s my point, is that — I am not an ideologue. I’m not. It doesn’t make sense if somebody could tell me you could do this cheaper and get increased results that I wouldn’t say, great. The problem is, I couldn’t find credible economists who would back up the claims that you just made. >",t3_a9oex9,moderatepolitics

"The phrase you're going to want to look up if you're going to research this is 'search engine optimization', and it is certain that right wing news sources are doing it because everyone is doing it. For those who are unaware search engine optimization is the process of trying to make your webpage show up higher in search engine results for certain phrases. That said they're honest ways to do it and dishonest ways to do it. Good ways include simple things like getting reputable sites to link to you, increasing the amount of text-based content you have, and linking to reputable sites. There's also metadata that can be built into a webpage to provide hints to search engines, when this is honest it is helpful. Some websites include analytics provided by search engines, so search engines indirectly measure traffic to some sites, and can measure if your site is getting traffic from legitimate sources. Bad ways of optimizing this include building a bunch of websites that link to each other to create the appearance of being a major news source, hiring (potentially Russian) click farms to post links to your site all over social media, and in general taking actions that the search engines have posted that you shouldn't do. In the situations where websites can measure where traffic is coming from taking active measures the obvuscate that and making it look like it's coming from a legitimate source is a kind of fraud and is often used by the less legitimate SEO providers. Here are some examples of search engine optimization doing some interesting things: Breitbart was stuffing Wikipedia with stuff because Wikipedia is used by search engines as a basis for a lot of web crawls, and Wikipedia kicked them out for being inaccurate:  Not sure exactly what happened here, this could have been a liberal attempt to optimize search engines to associate Nazism with this senator, or it could have been Republicans trying to make Nazism less terrible:  I'm get more, it's trivial easy, one just needs to know that magic phrase search engine optimization.

Now, Uber will need to limit drivers and stop them from logging in which will add administrative costs. They'll probably randomly choose who can get in vs out at first, or have a first come first serve, but then start allocating scheduled allowed hours to their best drivers. Either way it totally breaks the make your own schedule model of Uber. If they allow people to trade schedules or the ability to login to the app, then they are just recreating the old taxi medallion system. It also removes the incentive on drivers to head toward underserved areas looking for rides. If drivers get paid 17 no matter what, then why look for rides at all.

"Prior to the 1800s abortion was legal in most of the world, at least before *quickening*. In part the medical profession of the early 1800s helped push laws banning abortion, possibly because of the risks the available procedures posed in those days, possibly because physicians realized there'd be more money to be made from attending pregnant women for months than a single medical procedure. You believe life begins at conception. I grant that cell division begins after fertilization of the ovum. However, that's just one of several necessary conditions needed to result in a live birth. Precisely because some fertilized ova fail to implant, there's rather a lot of natural *deaths* of fertilized ova, and few seem to morn those *lives* or are willing to spend much thought about them. What's a few more *deaths* before viability? Regarding ectopic pregnancies: Yes, as a consequence of removing a diseased organ the child may die, but that is not the intended result. It may not be the goal, which would be the preservation of the mother's life, but the death of the fetus most definitely would be an absolutely necessary consequence of such a procedure. As a deliberate act which causes the *death* of the fetus, it is abortion by any meaningful definition except the tortured ones you seem to want to mandate in order to avoid allowing the possibility of any legal abortions. Also, it's not *organ failure*, it's a failure of the mechanics of reproduction, i.e., the failure of the fertilized ovum to implant in the correct place, the uterine wall. It's the fetus itself which causes the problem, and the only way to solve the problem is to remove the fetus. That is, abortion. And guess what? It can be done without removing the fallopian tubes if done early enough, so only removing the fetus and placenta and not any of the mother's organs. Or do you mean the fetus and placenta are the diseased organs? And, no, mother's bodies are not perfectly designed to carry ***all*** pregnancies to term. Ectopic pregnancies being a prime example of such pregnancies. Some pregnancies must either be ended by artificial means or mother and fetus both die. You seem desperate to avoid any circumstance in which abortion could be allowed/legal. And speaking for myself, viability is the sufficient condition for *life*. Fertilization is only a necessary condition, but not sufficient.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

"You're close, but you're still a bit off. a debt is a debt, and a line of credit is more analogous to the debt limit or debt ceiling (the most amount of money one could barrow) and the debt is the principle owed. &#x200B; This is not contradictory to what I stated. I even thought about throwing in a line about the debt ceiling being equivalent to the maximum size of the LOC. My point remains: if you continue to borrow against the line of credit, the amount owed goes up. If you operate at a deficit, you MUST continue to borrow against the line of credit, increasing the debt. If you bring in enough revenue to cover your expenses, but not enough to pay all of the interest generated form the debt in that year, then your debt continues to go up. The only way that you get the debt to go down is by bringing in more revenue than your expenses with enough of a surplus to pay all of the interested from the year AND pay down some of the principal. The national debt never went down during Clinton. Which means that we never had enough of a surplus to overcome the interest and reduce principal. &#x200B; I'll give that my statement is a bit misleading &#x200B; I've already stated that I think the national debt is a problem. But it is by no measurable statistic the worst it's ever been. You've attempted to paint it the worst it's ever been by several methods, and it's just not.

"Jeez, you have a problem with logic. Of course babies can't take care of themselves, so aren't viable with respect to ***REMAINING*** alive with no nurturing by other more developed individuals. However, since they are babies, they **ARE** alive, and in the US and many other nations the government assumes the care of those babies if the mother or mother's family is unwilling or unable to care for the baby. How is that possible? Law. See, law can be a good thing. As for more developed people requiring equipment or other persistent care to remain alive, the law in many states allows for Do Not Resuscitate orders signed by individuals which do prohibit life support equipment to be used to try to keep those individuals alive in some situations. Some states also allow close family members to decide whether to allow natural death. Comas are different as coma patients only need to be fed, cleaned, and receive rather basic physical therapy. There's also a difference between coma (some chance of recover) and brain death but functioning cardio-pulminary system (no chance of recovery). It's not ***murder*** because it's ***legal***. Not all killing is murder, since murder is a legal concept rather than a biological one. As for eugenics, you mean euthanasia. Consider buying a dictionary. Eugenics had it's day in the US in the form of compulsory sterilization; see the SCOTUS decision Buck v Bell. Also, it's you who's bringing euthanasia into the discussion. My position doesn't extrapolate to it. Only the mother can provide viability for a fetus; any moderately competent, physically and mentally healthy adult can care for a baby.

There's a ton of money in payment processing, and processing companies are usually good little capitalists. If it's legal, someone will happily accept money to process for you. Businesses just need to not assume it's the company who's name they've heard, or who processes for the coffee shop down the street.

"Before the hearing the defense had argued for leniency and many of Flynn's supporters had argued he was entrapped by the FBI because Flynn did not have a lawyer and he was not advised lying to the FBI was a crime. The judge went right after that: Sullivan began the hearing by questioning Flynn about that, and the former national security adviser conceded he was aware lying to the FBI was a crime when he did so and declined to withdraw his guilty plea to the offense — a mea culpa that could rankle supporters who have suggested he was duped by law enforcement into committing a crime. Flynn has been expected to make a personal plea for Sullivan to show him leniency, though the judge indicated early he was not inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. “I’m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,” Sullivan said. The judge was also clearly enraged by Flynn's undisclosed lobbying work for Turkey: After reviewing some of the allegations against Flynn, including that he worked to advance the interests of the Turkish government in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, the judge pointed to an American flag behind him in the courtroom and said heatedly, “Arguably, that undermines everything this flag over here stands for.

The biggest problem with the wall isn't its anti-immigration racism or its symbolism or whatever. The biggest problem with is is that it doesn't actually solve the problem it purports to solve. What is it purporting to solve? Well, directly it's purporting to block illegal immigration. But why is this necessary? Of course, because all of our economic problems are caused by illegal immigrants, so if we build the wall we fix the economy and if we don't build the wall we can't fix the economy.

"I don't see how this would be difficult to do at all. Honestly not trying to be a dick but have you ever read the actual ad? Couple of things of note. * in 1989 violent crime and murder rates were approaching record highs * The mayor of New York said something along the lines of we shouldn't hate these criminals but try to understand them. (finding the specifics would help but I was unable in a 5 minute search) So right off the bat an case can easily be made that Trump was responding to the crime rate and Koch as he literally references Koch, lists what he says and responds to it. So how can you definitively (as the media did) claim that this ad is in response to the Central Park 5? But the above is just icing. Here is the end all absolute proof Trump did not call for the Execution of the Central park 5 * Trump said rapists and muggers should be made to suffer. Now he doesnt reference them specifically but it's fair to say he is talking about them as they were accused of rape and mugging. * Trump goes on to say 'when they kill, they should be executed'. The 5 weren't accused of killing anyone. The victim in that case did not die. So it is in no way shape or form fair to claim Trump was talking about the 5 here. Right there alone, is proof that Donald Trump did not in any way call for rapists and muggers to be executed but he only called for murderers to be executed. There is no way you can claim that he called for their execution because he only called for murderers to be executed. **On top of that** Trump did a interview with Larry King where he once again clarifies that he is only calling for the execution of murderers when he says 'if she dies, they should be executed' when talking about a different case where a woman was beaten raped and thrown off a building but was still alive at the time of the interview. Trump never once called for the execution of anyone that didn't kill anyone, thus it is demonstratively false to claim that Trump called for the execution of the central park 5. If you read the ad you will see that it is a call for a more authoritarian approach to policing and to bring back the death penalty for murderers (not rapists and muggers). Can you argue that the Central Park Five case was a major catalyst for his ad. No doubt, but the actual ad is about a more authoritarian approach not killing rapists. If Trump did not clarify that only murderers should be executed within the ad you could make a case for those claiming he called for their execution. But he did make this clarification in the ad. Below is the article I would sue the shit out of CNN for as they not only perpetrate the lie that he called for their execution but they completely lie/mislead with this excerpt >Trump told King his newspaper ads were not 'pre-judging' the five teens, but rather advocating for their execution if they were to be found guilty. Trump also explained his ad didn't apply to minors, but said minors convicted of crimes should be locked up for a long time in the prison system. Watch the video in the article, it shows all of the above to be a complete misrepresentation of the truth * Trump wasn't talking about the 5 he was talking about the teens that threw a woman off the roof * Trump didn't advocate for their execution if found guilty. Trump literally says 'IF SHE DIES and they are found guilty, they should be executed'. * All of the 5 were minors yet while literally printing Trump clarified it wouldn't be for minors CNN purposefully neglects to mention that all 5 were minors thus again, Trump wasn't calling for their execution So not only was Trump not talking about the Central Park 5 as CNN implies he was, he said If the woman dies, and they are found guilty. CNN leaves out the 'if she dies part' because it doesn't fit the false narrative they are pushing in which they claim Trump called for the execution of the central park 5. This isn't just a newspaper making a mistake, they are purposefully misleading readers by mislabeling quotes and omitting pertinent facts in order to push a false narrative The article, and a great example of 'fake news' ",t3_a6vgps,moderatepolitics

"the fact of life You're still avoiding the necessity of ***defining*** life. Fertilization alone isn't life in the sense of being likely to lead to a live-born baby because some fertilized ova don't implant. Such fertilized ova are life in the biological sense that they're capable of cell division, but they're not life in the sense of viability. The legal definition of life must encompass viability, so conception on its own is insufficient. In that practical, legal sense, life DOES NOT begin at conception. Since other steps are necessary to achieve viability (likelihood the pregnancy could result in a live-born baby), viability is a necessary legal consideration for defining life. There is no absolutely clear moment at which viability is certain (and I mean probability 100%) other than at live birth. However, back to practicality, certainty isn't necessary. Likelihood is sufficient. However, likely viability HAS NOT been established at, say, 10 weeks. We're not going to agree. You believe conception is all it takes to create human life.

This is part of the reason why the GOP turned to Trump...they wanted someone who would punch back against Obama’s unwarranted and gross attacks. He exploited identity politics and division for his own political gain. Anytime a cop would shoot an African American, before we even got to learn the facts on the ground he would blame racism and white supremacy. Ferguson burned partially because people like Obama jumped to conclusions before the actual facts came out, like the fact that Mike Brown attacked a cop and the officers response was totally justified. Yet when a black terrorist was killing cops in Texas on racial grounds, he wouldn’t condemn the attacks as racist, when we knew that they in fact were. He applied totally different standards and rhetoric to situations based on the races of the victims/perpetrators. He was unbelievably divisive in a much more subtle way than Trump.

"NPR's Politics podcast is worth listening to. They do a weekly thursday summary podcast which is generally always worth it, and then they release episodes occasionally the rest of the week if something major happens. They don't really have a pro-Trump or conservative voice but they're usually aggressively neutral in talking about current events. &#x200B; Opening Arguments is a law podcast generally focused on political cases around current events and what's going to the supreme court. The hosts are unabashedly liberal and have generally been fair and even handed, as much as can be with some of the crazy legal threats and ridiculous statements that have defined the legal aspects of the Trump administration, in their topics. I'm a bit worried because a few of their recent podcasts have had trended to some more feels over facts and seemingly fed up with applying their usual rigor to relatively minor issues, but it's not a huge concern as of yet. &#x200B; BBC's The Inquiry and The Real Story are also worth listening to. The Inquiry takes a current events question and breaks it down into four parts, then gets experts to address each part in prerecorded. It occasionally has a big problem where they blatantly just ignore major aspects of a question but it doesn't happen that often. The Real Story is a longer podcast where they pick a topic and collect experts together and discuss it in a managed roundtable format. The Inquiry is generally a bit more academic expert focused while the Real Story will often pull in political and NGO representatives in addition to academic experts. Also because it's the BBC you often get a wide range of foreign topics regardless of what country you're in (including the UK). &#x200B; For non-political based podcasts, Freakonomics, Planet Money, and Slate Money are all excellent economics podcasts. Slate Money is mostly current events coverage without much political focus. Planet Money is more delving into data points and discussing actual economic research. Freakonomics is telling interesting stories through the lens of economic data and investigative reporting. &#x200B; SciFri and Science Vs for excellent science coverage. Science Vs looks at common laymen topics that get confused or misrepresented (is Vegan health/better, what type of fitness works, what is Lyme disease, what is true and false about gun violence, etc...). SciFri is a weekly podcast that covers anything science related for the week, often pulling in study authors to discuss their research and answer phone questions. &#x200B; Dan Carlin's Hardcore History and Backstory for your history needs. Hardcore History is basically audiobooks in podcast form and episodes are few and far between.

Every president in the past did not have substantial ties that put members of his campaign on the NSA/FBI radar, and triggered valid warrants that opened up an investigation. If in executing that warrant they find evidence of other crimes, they now have probable cause to pursue those leads. That is how criminal investigations at every level work -- and there is no reason Mueller should be any different.

"CS, yes. There are other issues at play. Have you tried seeing what women in these fields say? It does not confirm your suspicions. Link. You seem to be reading a lot into my argument that I'm not actually saying. You've stopped short of accusing me of denying that gender discrimination exists (which is good, because I explicitly said that I believe that it does), but not by much. This is the extent of my argument: There is reasonably strong evidence that there are population-wide gendered differences in interests (especially as measured on the people vs. things metric). There is reasonably strong evidence that at least some of this is driven by biology (especially developmental hormone exposure). This probably explains at least some of the gender gap in fields like CS, and probably explains at least some of the gender pay gap as women tend to choose lower paying positions in favor of other factors (let's ignore the structural economic question of why some types of jobs are paid more than others. It's not unrelated, but I think a little outside the scope). In a hypothetical world with no structural or any other kind of discrimination, where each person is free to pursue her own interests entirely, we should not expect to see 50/50 gender distributions in every field and in every position. And, at some point, pushing for that is a bad idea because we end up pressuring people into fields or positions they might not want. I'm not saying we're at the perfect equitable distribution in every field, but we might be close with regards to the general pay gap. Setting aside my general disdain for capitalism, if we're going to exist in that system, I'm not going to be advocating for more female CEO's so we can close what's left of the pay gap. Or even for women to take more voluntary overtime for that matter. It seems to me that women, more than men, are making the right call by opting out of high paying 'prestigious' positions that don't actually enrich their lives in meaningful ways. I don't know 100% why, but I'm also not sure it's a bad thing. >This is a much stronger statement, on par with me saying 'hormones play no role'. The data fits the theory, but that's not the way science goes. At best you can say 'preference is not entirely cultural, or perhaps Scandinavian and Northern European countries aren't great controls for whatever issues are happening in the US.' Which is why I prefaced it with 'it's almost as if' i.e. 'here is a plausible explanation for some data' not 'we know this to be the case.' >The much simpler explanation is that women in the 80's who were old enough to be professionals were brought up in the 60's, before things like the toy-isle-gender disparity impacted participation rates for girls and boys in tech activities. Girls in the 80's grew up in that environment and unsurprisingly are not now in CS. It's not perfect, but there are other trends going on besides the liberalization of the workforce for doctors. Now you're positing an explanation for the disparity with literally 0 data. You'd also need to explain why girls growing up in the 80's were much more strongly dissuaded from becoming programmers than lawyers or other male-dominated professions of the 60's. .

"Title to a house can legally be held by multiple people according to the title deed. A human body can not. If you look on the deed to a house, even for a married couple you will see both of them mentioned if they hold title in common- and in fact, one member of a couple can hold exclusive title and dispose of it without anyone else's involvement if it's their sole property. The 'legal merging' that several people have in this thread have claimed marriage creates does not exist in fact under the law in any modern legal system in any such simplistic way. All of these are just sloppy analogies though. A fetus that is pre-term and not viable outside the womb can not 'belong' to anyone except the person it is living inside- no one else can take legal or physical custody or directly provide care. The idea of paternal rights prior to delivery is essentially moot because it can't be exercised in any meaningful way unless you physically hold the woman captive. For most of the first two trimesters of gestation, the fetus is indistinguishable from any other organ in a woman's body in that respect. A spouse can't legally block you from donating your kidney because they might want it later, even donor compatibility was part of the reason they married you. A woman's right to direct her medical care, and privacy in consultation with a doctor are well established in most modern legal systems. The right of a man to direct how his sperm is used once he's parted with it voluntarily isn't. Consensual sex is not a contract to bear children. Marriage is not a contract to bear children. The only way to get children is for the person who is going to have to carry them in their body for nine months to be in agreement for the whole process. ",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

Just pointing out that what you are proposing differs from how marriage is actually legally constituted- under current laws in any modern democracy, no one who enters a marriage has fewer rights than before they were married. Giving up freedoms is one thing, rights is another. And if you want those freedoms back, you don't have to divorce to do so- if married couples want separate residences, bank accounts, or an open marriage, the state doesn't have to get involved. Requiring someone to end their marriage to restore the rights that they had before they entered into it (other than the right to marry) is a pretty radical change, but also resembles the status that women had before they were granted full civil rights.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

I agree that the media mischaracterized what Trump said, but I'm not sure it mischaracterized what he meant. Trump has not helped himself by doubling down on his statements that the Central Park 5 were guilty, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence.

"Great, so viability again - a subjective definition that opens us up to a whole lot of possibilities. Sometimes fetuses can't live at 20 weeks, sometimes they can, that's a grey line, why not 20 weeks since some lives can? Should we throw that away? Since viability now grants us humanity, or means that life is actually worth living, and since you said *normal* nurturing and care outside the womb, let's unplug everyone right now that needs assistance living. A pacemaker is not normal, therefore those people do not have a right to live. Lots of things that keep people alive aren't normal and those people would no longer be viable without them, so again murder. I'm glad the line is now grey, we can find lots of room to play with subjective definitions, especially the point at which a fetus can be viable! One minute it's a person, the next it isn't, and it'll be different for everyone, even on the scale of seconds, but that's ok and not at all incoherent. I'm the one throwing around the term *murder* because legality does not bind *morality*, which I've said probably half a dozen times. You then, after putting your pipe and no doubt expansive and lengthy novel down in which you learned words like elucidate, seem to bring it back to legality because..reasons I guess, as you're so taken with the fact that something having a legal definition makes it moral or not moral, because that form the word takes matters? You then morph that word into, not the wilful ending of another human life, but to mean doing so with enjoyment, as if the enjoyment is the trigger for it to be an actual murder. Amazing, you can't follow your own stream of logic here. Aaaaand you circled back to the government. Again, you don't address the pro-life argument, you make your own argument, poorly, and try and stand on that. Wonderful. You have a real problem making an argument and being coherent about it...because your argument isn't coherent. It stands - Human life starts at conception. Abortion is the willful ending of that human life based on real or perceived financial or emotional hardship. That is murder. That is wrong. You've said literally nothing against that, other than trying, for whatever reason, to bring the legal definition of murder in as the arbiter of objectivity, then going back on that and saying murder's actually about joy, then trying to say viability is the marker for life, then saying it's viability with a time limit on it regardless of how that would change from person to person, then you said elucidate and I laughed.

"**Political activities of the Koch brothers** The political activities of the Koch brothers include the financial and political influence of Charles G. and David H. Koch on United States politics. This influence is seen both directly and indirectly via various political and public policy organizations supported by the Koch brothers.The Koch brothers are the sons of Fred C. Koch, who founded Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States, of which they own 84%. Having bought out two other brothers' interests, they remain in control of the family business, the fortune which they inherited from their father, and the Koch family foundations. The brothers have made significant financial contributions to libertarian and conservative think tanks and have donated primarily to Republican Party candidates running for office.' A network of like-minded donors organized by the Kochs pledged to spend $889 million from 2009–2016 and its infrastructure has been said by Politico to rival 'that of the Republican National Committee.'

"I always find it funny when this issue of choice comes up and some people (this thread included) act as though this explains everything and that no further thought is required. In other words, that women *chose* for things to be this way, therefore the full responsibility of this outcome lies in their hands. For starters, this doesn’t change anything about the difference in overall income between men and women. Let’s not forget that still exists. What it does do, however, is help explain why this difference arises even without significant pay disparities for individual jobs *on average* (sexual discrimination by wages is still occasionally a problem, even if on average it is not). What it *doesn’t* do is explain why it is that women are making these choices and not men, and what impact the larger social context has on these choices made by women. People are somewhat rational, so just what is causing women to voluntarily pursue lower paying careers? What do women get out of this trade-off that men don’t (and why)? Obviously many of these answers are related to children and the disproportionate responsibility for child care and rearing generally placed on women. Maybe this *choice* thing is a lot of women responding realistically within the larger social contexts that are present about this. It also doesn’t explain why fields that see increased proportion of female workers also see wage declines over time, or vice versa. Interesting trends. So yes, choices by women are a huge part of explaining the wage gap, but there are *many* further aspects to consider further.

But in my experience as a leader, who also reports to leaders, the reports he is given, and the advice he receives is already a high level overview. They have been prepared for him by some of the best people in the country, and are specifically written to provide him with concise details. His job is to read them, ask questions about anything he doesn't understand, and listen to the people who advise him, and *then* make his own decisions. He needs to know what all the moving parts are in his administration, and make the best decision, as he is the one with the most complete knowledge, or at least he is supposed to be. If he never reads reports, and doesn't listen to his advisors, he is running *our whole country* with incomplete information. &#x200B; Would you trust a director level, hell even just managerial level, person to do their job effectively if they had no idea what was going on?

"Nice post and good explanation. When I think of this issue, I think of baseball cards. Weren't some cards more rare than others? And by definition, didn't that make those cards more valuable than the common ones? Also, wen't the star players more favored than the unknown players? So when you buy a pack of cards, you don't know if you're going to get common or rare, wanted or unwanted cards. Some people will even pay higher prices for a chance at a 'commemorative edition' or 'special edition' card in some packs. In short, you could pay $1 for something that's worth $0.05 or $100 on the open market, depending on your luck. It's definitely a tricky situation, but in the end, it's not the card makers' fault that people will pay $100 for a single card. Their cards are all of the same quality, and people pay to get 'random' cards, which they receive when they make a purchase. So I think it falls short of gambling. With loot boxes, if you pay $2 for a character, then you get a character. Sure, maybe it's not the one you wanted, but they are providing you with something of like quality and nature. The fact that you can't get the stuff you want by either (1) earning it in the game, or (2) paying for it **SHOULD** steer most reasonable people away from the game. Personally, I can't see why anyone would tolerate that. But people apparently enjoy being treated like that because they keep paying for loot boxes and games that contain loot boxes, so who am I to interfere? Now, if the loot box gave you either a character or nothing at all, then I think they would be crossing into gambling territory. I think it's a fine distinction, but one that puts loot boxes on par with baseball cards and all the other kinds of gaming cards such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, etc. The rule in our house is once we purchase a game, that's it. I don't care if something in the game costs an extra $0.01, the kids are not allowed to purchase it. So games with DLC are out (including loot boxes), unless they are happy playing with it as is with no extra purchases. I'd rather pay $60 for a game than pay $20 and then be nagged to pay $1 here and there. Not my idea of 'fun' at all, especially as a parent!

"There are 3 conflicting interpretations: spiritual/philosopical/moral, biological, and legal. Maybe life begins at conception in the 1st (it doesn't for me, but I'll stipulate for the sake of argument). Fertilization alone does not have a consensus as the beginning of life with professionals in the 2nd group; failure to implant isn't immediate death because nonimplanted fertilized ova would continue with cell division; however, it ceases to be potential live birth. Finally, legal, the only sense with practical relevance, and in that context currently ***life DOES NOT begin at conception***. I realize you want to change that 3rd case, but you need a more compelling argument than you really, Really, REALLY believe life begins at conception. First, you have to define what a fertilized ovum which fails to implant would be. As for our discussion of ectopic pregnancies, you're playing semantic games. If removal of a particular part of the interior of a pregnant woman's body guarantees the death of the fetus, and the presumably medical personnel who perform that removal are fully aware that doing so kills the fetus, you're seriously going to assert the consequences for the fetus are unintentional? Looks like I also have to ask you to define *intentional*. Also, when fertilized ova implant in fallopian tubes, the fallopian tube isn't diseased except insofar as there's a fetus growing there. In such cases, the fetus would be the cause of the disease, perhaps it would be the disease itself. Me, I don't hold that. For me it's just one of many fortuitous eventualities which entail nonviability, which from my perspective means the fetus isn't ***life*** in the practical sense that there'd be 0% probability of resulting in a live birth. You'd be far better off simply accepting that all humans, including pregnant women, have a Common Law right to self-defense. In some cases, the entity putting the pregnant woman's life at risk would be the fetus inside the woman. If the woman would have the right to fight off an adult attacker, wouldn't she also have the right to have the fetus THREATENING BOTH THEIR LIVES removed? Isn't a live woman and a dead fetus better than both woman and fetus dead? I suspect you want to avoid this at all costs because allowing any one scenario for legal abortion (defined as *the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy*, which is exactly what the medical procedure needed to treat ectopic pregnancies so that the mother lives would be) opens the door to other potential scenarios for legal abortion, and you don't want that. Also, of course the fetus in the case of ectopic pregnancy doesn't *intend* to kill the mother. There are many possible scenarios in which people (for the sake of argument, adults) have no intention of killing others yet due to circumstances do pose imminent mortal risk to others. If the only practical means of eliminating that mortal risk required killing the person posing that risk, that's legal self-defense. In terms of the law, the intention or lack of conscious intention on the part of the person posing the mortal risk is IRRELEVANT. Only the intention of the person at mortal risk killing the person posing the mortal risk matters, and it's legal self-defense in many cases. Aborting an ectopic pregnancy is a perfectly clear and valid example of it. Finally, since it seems you're the one who wants to change US law, you're the one who's implicitly bringing your philosophy into the discussion. I'm just trying to expose it to show that yours may not be a majority opinion. Just because you believe your position is correct doesn't mean your opinion has a consensus. If you want to believe your position is moral and current law is immoral, that's OK, and no different from a legal perspective than those who believe laws banning prostitution are immoral (impeding right to contract) and those who believe laws permitting prostitution, e.g., in some Nevada counties, are immoral. Morality isn't a requirement for laws, especially when there's no broad consensus on what's moral and what's immoral.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

"No, we can't, because the U.S. District Court upheld the opinion of the government that the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs along the border demonstrated 'an acute and immediate need'. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case. But, greenlab, that must mean what the DHS said was true! If only. Let's look at Curiel's opinion from the case: The court is aware that the subject of these lawsuits, border barriers, is currently the subject of heated political debate in and between the United States and the Republic of Mexico as to the need, efficacy and the source of funding for such barriers,' Curiel wrote. 'In its review of this case, the Court cannot and does not consider whether underlying decisions to construct the border barriers are politically wise or prudent. Ah. So he ruled, as a good judge should, that technically DHS has been granted broad power to make these unilateral decisions and are within the law to do this, regardless of their justifications, since no one has the authority to over-ride these justifications. Great. More from the Judge: Both Congress and the Executive share responsibilities in protecting the country from terrorists and contraband illegally entering at the borders. Border barriers, roads, and detection equipment help provide a measure of deterrence against illegal entries,' Curiel wrote. 'With section 102, Congress delegated to its executive counterpart, the responsibility to construct border barriers as needed in areas of high illegal entry to detect and deter illegal entries. In an increasingly complex and changing world, this delegation avoids the need for Congress to pass a new law to authorize the construction of every border project. So, is there any truth to the DHS?  Take it from some of the people who have smuggled immigrants and dope for a living: Where agents and politicians see future walls, they see ladders, ropes and the promise of higher profits. When prosecutors see adult smugglers going to jail, they see hard-to-jail juveniles replacing them. And where politicians see more agents protecting the border, they see potential accomplices who can be bribed to look the other way. “We always had a [paid] lookout from the Border Patrol,” said Armendariz, a Laredo native who smuggled migrants in the Rio Grande Valley for years until she got busted in 2012; she served a year and a half in federal prison. “Border Patrol, cops, whatever, they’re gonna get that money.” So.

"Hotair: Still, ‘women are making the wrong choices at work’ Wrong choices eh? Let's do better than the author and just skip over the Dally Caller article they read to write their article, and : We find that male operators exploit FMLA to game the system: by substi- tuting unpaid hours for overtime hours, they actually increase their earnings. That's a woman making a wrong choice? Interesting... Women with dependents – single women in particular – are considerably less likely than men with dependents to accept an overtime opportunity. This is especially the case during weekends and after regular work hours, times when there are fewer childcare options available. Ah yes, that classic wrong choice, providing for your children. First, if operators are allowed to exchange or transfer shifts, unexpected absenteeism could be reduced. This would have the dual effect of decreasing unpaid time off and decreasing resultant last-minute overtime opportunities – both of which fuel the earnings gap. Service provision would also improve. Second, expanding the number of operators whose job is specifically to cover for others’ absences would also likely decrease gaps in service, overtime expenses, and the earnings disparity There's a way to maintain flexibility without increasing the wage gap? Why do the women choose not to implement that? Wrong choice ladies! with more options, women’s need to take unpaid time off decreases while their ability to work longer hours increases.This, in turn, results in a narrowing of the earnings gap at high levels of seniority. Interesting, when there are actual choices, then it seems like things work out OK for women. I'm sure that we're all still comfortable saying women make 'wrong choices', though. Single women, on the other hand, appear to be making the decision to do the caretaking themselves rather than to caretake through additional earnings. It is, of course, possible that for women this situation is not as much a personal preference as it is a constraint. Thus, our results imply that differences in care-taking approaches and responsibilities appear to be a major reason why women work less overtime than men. What, what, what?! It may not be a choice, but a constraint? I was promised, 'wrong choices.' Looking at operators who are married and without children, however, we see that men are as many as 6 percentage points more likely than women to accept an overtime opportunity. Married female operators who do not have dependents are, it seems, less likely to play the co- breadwinner than if they had dependents. This result is our clearest clue that intra-household dynamics – gender norms and bias mixed in with preferences – keep women from accepting opportunities to work more hours at a premium rate. I thought we were destroying this myth? It thus appears that women are trading off less convenient schedules for less desirable routes, prioritizing schedule-related amenities on the job over route quality-related amenities OK, now you're telling me that women take the harder routes, for less pay. I guess that's a wrong choice. While we cannot fully determine whether preferences or personal life con- straints are driving the choices we observe, our evidence does show that increasing the pre- dictability of overtime opportunities along with schedule flexibility can help women work more hours and reduce the earnings gap. So again, we allow people to schedule their lives to meet their responsibilities and the earnings gap closes. A system that relies on last minute decision making hurts women. Hoatair.com promised me that I wouldn't find ‘women are systematically being held back at work.’ (I'm quoting Hotair, I don't know who they were quoting.) The gender earnings gap observed in our setting emerges because of differential responses to the institutional environment. Please stop saying that Harvard researchers, you're really 'destroying' the narrative here. I was able to read this article in about 20 minutes, and it's not even my job. I wonder why Hotair and Daily Caller couldn't be bothered. They are attempting to accurately report the findings of this article, and not just make some partisan point, right? Sarcasm aside, the real point of this study is that these practices that incidentally hurt women also hurt the agency's bottom line. They could be paying regular-time when they instead pay overtime. A fairer structure that closes the wage gap also reduces operating costs. ",t3_a5hraj,moderatepolitics

The author goes on to show that these differences in aggression and sensitivity are rather minimal >For example, he states that the sex differences in physical aggression and physical strength are “large”. The study very specifically says the opposite of this. So it seems like both Hyde and the author are playing fast and loose. That's more evident where the author actually does cite evidence: >Might sexist parents be buying computers for their sons but not their daughters, giving boys a leg up in learning computer skills? In the 80s and 90s, everybody was certain that this was the cause of the gap. Newspapers would tell lurid (and entirely hypothetical) stories of girls sitting down to use a computer when suddenly a boy would show up, push her away, and demand it all to himself. But move forward a few decades and now young girls are more likely to own computers than young boys – with little change in the high school computer interest numbers. So that isn’t it either. Think about that: Everyone in the 80's was deluded into thinking that purchasing sons computers instead of daughters led to more tech acumen. Cut forward a few decades (when sons and daughters are now actually earning) and new young'ns are getting computers but the earners haven't changed! Weird, it's almost as if we're seeing the effects in real time of how it affects future choices. Women are joining tech fields more and more, which follows the catch-up lag of girls getting computers more and more. See my prior point about the first programmers being women, in the 50s and 60s, when it was *much* more a menial, solitary, technical job than it is now (as in, absorbed in tech versus social cooperation, not as in ENIAC was more advanced than a smartphone). >It’s pretty relevant. Meta-analyses have shown a very large (d = 1.18) difference in healthy men and women (ie without CAH) in this domain. It’s traditionally summarized as “men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people”.

And I would flesh out “people” to include communities, talking, helping, children, and animals. Note that this is treating exogenous variables as internal. It assumes that gendered preoccupation with these things, and where we see them interface with the data, happens 'purely', as in, external of 'privilege based effects' or 'cultural learning'. And that's kind of absurd. It has in no way controlled for culture in applying the theory. So no, the 'privilege based theory' hasn't failed, the author has simply excised it from being a discriminatory variable and declared it vanished. The author has not 'been proven wrong' with this. The conclusion that it's all hormones and us silly leftists/progressives who were right about lawyers and doctors back when those were a fight, are suddenly now wrong because of a newly invented theory of ignorance that treats outcomes as the only relevant variable, that could actually somehow be true.

"Instead of trying to add value to low value areas and populations this tries to fix things with tax cuts. The way the tax cuts are handled only big and well connected corporate players will know about the tax cuts and have the opportunity to take advantage. Instead of directing investment this is a way of institutionally enforcing low value status and and causing areas to become dumping grounds for operations that would otherwise either shut down or be forced to improve. A better solution would be to figure out how taxes should work as simply as possible and then apply those rules as broadly as possible. If there are cases where subsidies are needed then supply resources directed at developing low value labor and areas into higher value through improvements, infrastructure, or other developments. The idea that tax cuts are the answer to everything is flat out wrong and draws uncompetitive parasites who would otherwise be flushed away in favor of genuinely improved business conditions. I would in particular call out those who say this will generate investment. We constantly see reports that Podunk Town in Flyover Country is the absolute best for business but when looking closer one sees that Podunk Town is a dump with little to offer except tax subsidies for crooked players. All the biggest most influential and fast growing businesses keep getting started and developed in relatively high tax urban areas that are supposedly so hostile to business that no one can make or sell anything anymore except somehow that is where all the business is golly how does that always happen.

And to reiterate a point you missed, what exactly do you want her to apologise for? I've stated what I want her to apologise for, but I also don't see a need for her apology to go any further than that. edit: one thing that came to my mind just as I was about to reply to someone else, is that she could also apologise for potentially misleading the law association on their own diversity statistics. If the point of these statistics is to make sure there's at least some Native American representation, then she could very well have taken a chance away from a much more Native American lawyer by listing herself as such.

The Court acknowledges that in some cases, this format of cross-examination may not constitute a due process violation. However, in this case, Plaintiff was effectively denied the right to cross-examination because he was not notified in advance of the hearing that Jane Roe would not be present at the ARC Hearing. It was plain at the hearing that Plaintiff intended to ask certain questions, but because Jane Roe was not present at the hearing, he was not able to ask those questions.

"The professor of criminology is partially correct. Dumbass law enforcement officer here. Let me explain it in simpler terms. Crimes have elements, and all of the elements of the crime must be present for it to be considered a *crime*. One of the elements to all crimes are **culpable mental states**. Now, there are certain crimes (like DUI/DWI/OUI) that are *strict liability* crimes, which means that you are culpable simply for committing the act. Other crimes vary based on your culpable mental state (i.e. knowingly, recklessly, etc). In the campaign finance law violation above, if Trump did not have the culpable mental state required to be charged (knowing that what he did was illegal and still intending to do it anyway), then he literally **did not commit the crime**. All of the elements are not present. And while ignorance of the law is not a defense of the law, a lack of a culpable mental state absolutely is a defense. Anecdotally, a guy shot his wife and the prosecutors failed to bring charges against him because he claimed he thought his wife was an intruder. We were unable to show otherwise, so despite the fact that we could prove he got his gun, he pointed the gun at his wife, he pulled the trigger, and his wife was shot, he was never held criminally liable because we were missing that single important element; his culpable mental state.

See, the thing about Trump is he tweets a lot of things that others think but do not say...and he does not have a filter, so what he thinks comes out without a second thought.

"Hip Hop and their respective artists are constantly criticized when it comes to misogyny, homophobia, and some other issues that come up. Just from the top of my head here are a few criticisms and backlash: This is a criticism of Kanye West’s TLOP:  This is about the backlash to Migos’ homophobic lyrics:  Azaelia Banks was banned from twitter and apologized for homophobic and racist comments:  Furthermore, I would argue the a large number of musicians (and stars in general) get away with some pretty horrible (and illegal) things, and people just shrug it off. Look at Jimmy Page, who had a relationship with a 14 year old, and refused to allow her to leave his house so that he was not caught:  To add politics to things, Ted Nugent was a (proudly self admitted) draft dodger, who sang songs about forcing himself on a 13 year old, and adopted an underage girl (16) so that he could legally bring her on tour. Why is he so loved among Conservatives, and even has a relationship with our own President? Isn’t he the antithesis of conservative ideals?

"You drawing a distinction between a 'live-born baby' and a zygote as one having been delivered doesn't detract from the latter's status of 'alive' or 'human,' it just distinguishes the two in their development. Your trying to draw a definition based on developmental markers is exactly what /u/otiac correctly regards as extrinsic and applied by someone else to fit an agenda (e.g. 'at what stage in its development am I comfortable terminating this human life?')… one could just as easily reason that 'are those infants life? More so than a zygote, but not viable in any meaningful way' as infants are more reliant upon others (the facetious 'parasitic' argument people like to peddle) than toddlers in that stage of their development. Introducing 'legality' as a concept that has to be applied in regards to these 'developmental markers' is, again, one of those extrinsic things /u/otiac talked about. Either humans are intrinsically humans from the point of conception onward, or their 'humanity' is lacking for some extrinsic reason and we can start to kick around at what point racism or eugenics are no longer okay (e.g. is it okay to abort 'colored' 'non-human clumps of cells,' female 'non-human clumps of cells' et cetera).

To ensure all the criminals they arrest *stay* arrested, they must follow these rules or else entire back-logs of non-related cases can be re-tried. So, to assume the FBI are not doing *everything* by the book is really quite **conspiratorial** with no proof of them doing anything wrong in this entire matter.

"One more from the same OP video: Actually, I’ve gotten many of your ideas. I’ve taken a look at them, even before I was handed this. Some of the ideas we have embraced in our package. Some of them are embraced with caveats. So let me give you an example. I think one of the proposals that has been focused on by the Republicans as a way to reduce costs is allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines. We actually include that as part of our approach. But the caveat is, we’ve got to do so with some minimum standards, because otherwise what happens is that you could have insurance companies circumvent a whole bunch of state regulations about basic benefits or what have you, making sure that a woman is able to get mammograms as part of preventive care, for example. Part of what could happen is insurance companies could go into states and cherry-pick and just get those who are healthiest and leave behind those who are least healthy, which would raise everybody’s premiums who weren’t healthy, right? So it’s not that many of these ideas aren’t workable, but we have to refine them to make sure that they don’t just end up worsening the situation for folks rather than making it better. And another from his 2011 SOTU: Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America’s success. But if we want to win the future -– if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -– then we also have to win the race to educate our kids. Think about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us –- as citizens, and as parents –- are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed. That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It’s family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. (Applause.) We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline. Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools don’t meet this test. That’s why instead of just pouring money into a system that’s not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top. To all 50 states, we said, “If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we’ll show you the money.” Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation. For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning. And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country. And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that’s more flexible and focused on what’s best for our kids. (Applause.) You see, we know what’s possible from our children when reform isn’t just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities. Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs. But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their families to go to college. And after the first year of the school’s transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, “Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.” (Applause.) That’s what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country. Let’s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as “nation builders.” Here in America, it’s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. (Applause.) We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. (Applause.) And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. (Applause.)",t3_a9oex9,moderatepolitics

"And it is the creation of new life that is assumed to be good, or 'ordered' as the Catachism says. And that's where it breaks down. Creation of new life isn't inherently good.

Teen mothers and unprepared are EXACTLY the kinds of situations in which we're saying people SHOULDN'T have sex, BECAUSE they are unprepared to deal with the consequences. But just because the parents are not prepared to raise the child properly doesn't mean that the creation of life is inherently anything other than good. 'The logic also conceptualizes sex as merely a means of reproduction, ignoring its role in most romantic relationships.' No. The Church does NOT view sex *only* as a means of reproduction. The Catechism, various Papal encyclicals, even John Paul II's Theology of the Body go deeply into the importance of sex as part of a marriage. However, that relationship enhancement always comes as a secondary benefit to the creation of life. The creation of life is an inherent good.

"OK OP, help me out here. Because I read the linked study and couldn't find key 'quotes' in the article in said study. Here is the conclusion of the CPRP report near the end: >During 2016 and 2017 we saw significant efforts made by Russia to disrupt elections around the world, but also political parties in these countries spreading disinformation domestically. Looking at the growth of cyber troop activity from 2017 to 2018 has demonstrated that these strategies are circulating globally. We cannot wait for national courts to address the technicalities of infractions after running an election or referendum. Protecting our democracies now means setting the rules of fair play before voting day, not after. >[...]A strong democracy requires high-quality news from an independent media, a pluralistic climate of opinion, and the ability to negotiate public consensus. But the IRA leveraged social media to manufacture and spread junk news, manipulate public opinion, and subvert democratic processes. >[...]. The ubiquity and prominence of social media for everyday life underscores their importance in today’s society, and users place high amounts of trust in these platforms. But with their ability to segment audiences and target messages in a quick, cheap and largely unregulated way, it is clear why these platforms have attracted the interest of political operators. Unfortunately, **there is mounting evidence that social media are being used to manipulate and deceive the voting public—and to undermine democracies and degrade public life.** From the article, we have these series of 'quotes' from the source. >To be exact, just “11% of the total content” attributed to the IRA and 33 percent of user engagement with it “was related to the election.” The IRA’s posts “were minimally about the candidates,” with “roughly 6% of tweets, 18% of Instagram posts, and 7% of Facebook posts” having “mentioned Trump or Clinton by name.” I could not find any of these quotes in the CPRP report.

"I have been increasingly skeptical of this Russiagate story since the beginning, because it smacked so much of a conspiracy theory that people were desperately trying to find evidence for. Here's the editor of Mother Jones in his summary of the big picture of the story as we have it today: edit: The editor of MJ is arguing that the Russiagate conspiracy is a Big Deal that we should all follow closely. >1) Trump, while campaigning for president, had a secret deal in Russia for which his attorney sought Putin’s help. Trump lied to the public about this. - Thing is, this 'secret deal' is described in the editors words earlier as a 'secret deal' to open a Trump Tower in Moscow, which Trump says ended in 'early 2016', but apparently ended in June, which makes it lying on Trump's part. It's not shown whether Trump was doing this directly or if his organization was carrying on with the negotiations, or if it was something along the lines of sending invoices or whatever after a deal wasn't reached. >2)Trump’s campaign was informed that Moscow intended to intervene to help Trump. It said nothing about this information, essentially encouraged the Kremlin, and denied Moscow’s involvement once the Russian hack-and-dump attack became publicly known. - But it's still not clear if the Russian state did this hack, and it's not clear (to me at least) that any of this 'Russian hacking' was at all effective. The dog that didn't bark seems to show that it wasn't. >3) Trump, after being told the Kremlin was attempting to subvert an American election, claimed no such thing was happening. He covered for Putin. - This again assumes there was any effective 'subverting' of an American Election. I still don't see any evidence that's worth considering. I get that lots of people do e.g. there's a top posting in this subreddit talking about how the Russians changed our election results with memes. Memes! if that isn't the dumbest, techno- and media-ignorant, boomer's idea of a conspiracy I don't know what is. So in essence this story has morphed from Trump being a secret KGB mole down to being guilty of once attempting to negotiate building a Trump tower in Moscow.

"From your linked article: Following the Secure Fence Act of 2006, Yuma tripled manpower and added mobile surveillance, as well as fencing and vehicle barriers. It also added 58 miles of fence (to get to 63) to the total of 126 miles that county shares with Mexico. And straight from his co-worker: “If you did try to cross and you got caught, you were held accountable. There were consequences,” Bratcher said. “So the combination, the fence slowed them down, but they are going to find a way over it, under it, through it, whatever. **But the real issue was, when you got caught, you went to jail. It stopped.**” Bold me. I could also bold that sentence before that where he says the obvious logic that they will found ways around it.

"From his 'More Perfect Union' speech: And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me. He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms, or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions — the good and the bad — of the community that he has served diligently for so many years. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother — a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. These people are a part of me. And they are part of America, this country that I love. Some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable. I can assure you it is not. I suppose the politically safe thing to do would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro, in the aftermath of her recent statements, as harboring some deep-seated bias. But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America — to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through — a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect. And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every American. Understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point. As William Faulkner once wrote, 'The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past.' We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the African-American community and the larger American community today can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools were and are inferior schools; we still haven't fixed them, 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education. And the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students. Legalized discrimination — where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions or the police force or the fire department — meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between blacks and whites, and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in so many of today's urban and rural communities. A lack of economic opportunity among black men, and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion of black families — a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened. And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods — parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pickup, building code enforcement — all helped create a cycle of violence, blight and neglect that continues to haunt us. This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generation grew up. They came of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What's remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame the odds; how many were able to make a way out of no way, for those like me who would come after them. For all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who didn't make it — those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations — those young men and, increasingly, young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour of American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the African-American community in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful. And to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience — as far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything. They built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away. And in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear an African-American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. A bit of a more confrontational approach in a gun control forum in 2016: First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks' guns is just not true. And I don't care how many times the NRA says it. I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it's just not true. What I have said is precisely what you suggested, which is, why don't we treat this like every other thing that we use? I just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I got people who we know have been on ISIL Web sites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we're allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun. This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much — as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing's prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is. So, sir, I just have to say, respectfully, that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws. There is a way for us to make sure that lawful, responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting, hunting, protecting yourself, but the only way we're going to do that is if we don't have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the Second Amendment. And that's how the issue too often gets framed.",t3_a9oex9,moderatepolitics

We believe in individual responsibility, so yeah, if someone was negligent with their firearm, they should absolutely be liable if it was misused or stolen. Anyone who leaves loaded weapons lying about near small children shouldn't have either. But we also advocate for more firearms education as well. Guns aren't toys. The education programs are (imho) the only good thing the NRA does, and there's some other people doing important work in this area as well, such as Maj Toure of Black Guns Matter. But we would 100% oppose anything meant to disarm the population, *especially* if it is lopsided and would more adversely affect the poor. An armed population is the last limit on government abuses. Throughout history, even prior to the invention of firearms, government oppression is always preceded by civilian disarmament. We fought a rebellion over this. The Battle of Concord was an attempt by the British army to confiscate two privately owned cannon - weapons of war. We didn't like it then and we don't like it now. The gun violence problem is an entirely different issue, and our argument is generally that gun control infringes upon citizens' rights but does not guarantee anyone's safety. It's security theater. We've had widespread firearms ownership in this country for hundreds of years, but the mass violence problem is relatively new. Guns aren't the cause. There's something else wrong, something sick in our culture. There's not going to be any simple solution to fix it. Neither banning guns nor arming teachers will prevent school shootings. The best way to protect yourself is likely to learn to responsibly use and carry a firearm.",t3_a4mxd8,moderatepolitics

Someone who’s charismatic and has the ability to convince America to take on a spending plan that will destroy our economy is dangerous. Ironically if our economy were destroyed it would probably cause far fewer people to have health insurance than do today. Today, if you walk into a hospital but have no money, you will be treated regardless. It is still terrible to end in debt, obviously, but if you were to walk into a hospital in a bankrupt America, you might not be treated. That option may be off the table if we do something drastic and severely cripple our economy.

"After initial implementation costs, automation cost year over year will normally be substantially lower. Total automation cost needs to be compared over the same time span. If total wages for workers are 50g a year, thats 500g over ten years. If automation yearly operating costs are 20g/yr, thats 200g over ten years leaving 300g for initial start up costs to break even. Automation also has fewer wild card variables to deal with like calling in sick or bad attitude. What you are suggesting is letting market forces determine wage. The problem with that in the US is automation, high workforce supply, and foreign competition are suppressing those wages. That creates more and more inequality. Your long term solution to re-educate the workforce to fit higher skill jobs will be unworkable for a large part of the workforce. That is the problem. College level learning is beyond the capability of a good portion of humanity - bluntly, it’s not that they are uneducated, it’s that they are genuinely stupid. There will be jobs out there for them, but wages will be necessarily low to stay below the cost of automating. Like the article mentions, this a coming revolution, not the 100 year long progression. Maybe it won’t be any worse than the automobile replacing horses, or production lines? I think it will be more transformational and happen quickly and possibly be more damaging more along the lines of refrigerators and the iceman.

"Article excerpt: Two new reports on Russian political interference released by the Senate this past week — one from ' Although he wasn’t speaking directly about civil rights, it’s impossible to ignore how well the issue fits. In the closing sections of the “Long Telegram,” Kennan wrote: Much depends on health and vigor of our own society…. Every courageous and incisive measure to solve internal problems of our own society, to improve self-confidence, discipline, morale and community spirit of our own people, is a diplomatic victory over Moscow worth a thousand diplomatic notes and joint communiqués…. We must formulate and put forward for other nations a much more positive and constructive picture of sort of world we would like to see than we have put forward in past. Similarly, Kennan's Foreign Affairs essay concluded: The issue of Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this. In the light of these circumstances, the thoughtful observer of Russian-American relations will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlin's challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which, by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear [...] What all these examples serve underscore is something that should be obvious but perhaps needs to be said: The best way to defend America is not with hardware or software or technical fixes, but by America realizing its highest ideals.

Very often the government's response is to refer similar embarrassments the last time the opposition was in power, even if it was a different leadership at the time. Given how things are playing out in the US, it seems there is a tendency to evolve towards hyperpartisanship and the US system is not strong enough to overcome this.

"One of the biggest issues with basing a single payer program on Medicare instead of Medicaid is that Medicare spending increases year after year automatically. It takes an act of congress to reduce the growth of the program (which is the fastest growing line item in the federal budget as-is only applying to 65+) and that reduction in growth immediately gets spun by AARP as a cut even though it is never a cut, but merely a reduction in the rate of acceleration. This creates a problem in a democracy where elected officials has a powerful disincentive to address any looming budget problems even if they all agree that they are unavoidable without reducing the year to year growth of Medicare. &#x200B; By contrast, a single payer program that was based on Medicaid would require congress to act in order to authorize each year's budget or at least pass continuing resolutions like we do to fund the rest of government. This is obviously more responsible as a method of funding because it allows for both positive or negative growth year to year based on conditions and the economic health of the program. We can have a real values based debate, weighing what we want to be covered against what people are willing to see withheld from their paycheck and that will probably fluctuate along with public opinion just as government programs should in a healthy democracy. &#x200B; I'm not an expert on all the different country's single payer programs and the differences between them, but I would be pretty surprised if very many of them were as cushy as Medicare and also on budgetary autopilot. The Medicare for All proposal is laid out in such a way as to present a binary choice between MFA and the status quo and they aren't making it clear to the public that there are other ways to do single payer or why they chose Medicare as the model. This kind of obfuscation is probably the biggest reason why the Medicare for All crowd is actually standing in the way of a single payer program actually being adopted. The CBO numbers are going to come out, then people are going to realize what their personal tax contribution would be and the level of support for single payer will crater because people think single payer automatically means Medicare for All. The thing is this: America has an unusually narrow tax base. Certainly far narrower than any country that has universal healthcare. Currently, the top quintile is paying 86% of all federal income taxes. In order to fund a massive program like Medicare for All, the funding will have to come from the automatic Witholding Tax that every person has automatically taken out of their check and sent to the government the way Social Security and Medicare are done now. So currently, when you look at your pay stub, you see 6.2% taken off the top for Social Security and 1.45% taken out for Medicare. If Medicare covered 325 million people instead of 44 million people, your Medicare withholding would obviously need to be some much larger number,at least as large as your SS witholding and possibly as much as 10%. You may think that people's natural reaction would be to compare that to what they had been paying in health insurance before, but people have shown over and over that they have a viscerally negative reaction to additional taxes. That reaction is going to be amplified by GOP and various interest groups running adds telling voters that they could do better if given their own money and allowed to spend it how they like. That may be true or untrue, but it's obviously a lot easier to attack a program that results in a big new tax than it is to defend it.",t3_a2wuos,moderatepolitics

If the cost construction/maintenance is not even close to that of the impact illegal entry has on the tax payer, and 60 % of illegal entry takes place at the ports, which can be enforced with out a wall, this is a net lose. The only viable reason for a physical wall as opposed to say, tightening of immigration procedures is nationalism. It only works on at most, 40% of illegal entry.

The state of math education sucks that it is easy to trick people with bad numbers but this seems to be used most often against consumers, and then defended by both sides of the political spectrum.

I'm not exactly trying to make a giant convoluted argument. Other countries with gun restrictions have less gun violence and less violence. That's a pretty direct claim, and I can't even explain how that works: guns make violence easier. I wish we could all accept some of these base facts, because there are better arguments to be made for supporting guns. If you are a believer in the four boxes of democracy, soap, ballot, jury, and finally ammo, then it's not very difficult to make a case that a level of gun violence is acceptable as last line of defense against tyrants. This argument might even have good facts supporting it, but I've never needed to try arguing against it and I probably wouldn't.

I was wrong about Reid's destruction of filibuster applying to SCOTUS but it still applies to judicial nominees broadly. And I think the concern about the far left petulantly pushing extreme reforms with massive potential for unintended consequences (such as this) is valid in light of other proposals such as abolishing ICE and the electoral college. What exactly is the problem with Gorsuch and Kavanaugh other than people's feelings about them? I haven't seen that they've been partisan. I don't see how this isn't a 'solution' in search of a problem with high potential for negative side effects. If Ezra the far left (and the right as well!) are really concerned about the high-stakes emotional nature of SCOTUS appointments they could stop slandering moderate justices as extremists (and rapists!!!) while simultaneously lionizing and building a cult of personality around another fairly moderate justice (RBG). EDIT: You seem to suggest that under the current system Trump can appoint extremist judges and that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are extremists. This is completely false. Both are constitutionalists and with Gorsuch in particular there's no debate about it. Furthermore the president (especially this one) doesn't have that kind of power to get the party to vote for whomever he chooses. In both cases POTUS was given a short list by McConnell which i believe is de rigeur. There's nothing wrong with the system and the SCOTUS justices we have are all pretty good.

"I think this falls into two categories: 1.Can people fairly compete in today’s internet age (Monopolies) 2. Should more groups of people (specifically political ideologies) fall under protected classes, or should we do away with protected classes altogether For point 1, I would strongly argue that (given Net Neutrality) that people can still compete with giants, especially when it comes to the web. You bring up Comcast, but that is very different than a company like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and Facebook, purely based on choice. When I move somewhere, depending on the area, I don’t have a choice on who my internet provider is, I am forced to go with Comcast, and a new one cannot move into town, even if they have significant financial backing (see how Google was unable to use public poles for Fiber, since they were designated to another ISP). I am not forced to use YouTube, Patreon, Instagram, etc. there are alternatives for each that have a suitable user population and are just as convenient. Things become more challenging with PayPal, but there are a number of startups that still exist (Stripe and Square can fill that void from my limited knowledge). What makes the internet so great is that I can make my own form of Patreon today (If I was so inclined) and have it as accessible as any other site on the internet (within reason, there are numerous optimizations to consider). Assuming Net Neutrality doesn’t go completely in the trash, it is reasonable for a company to decide who uses their platform. 2. Should political speech be protected, and to what extent? This is more challenging. Free speech, in the most simplistic terms, just means that I cannot be arrested (within reason) for the things I say. It does not mean that people have to host me on their private land. That concept becomes more challenging with the Civil Rights act, in which you cannot discriminate against someone for their race, ethnicity, or sexuality, however there is a difference between denying someone business based on their identity vs giving someone free will to express themselves in any way they see fit. So at what point are we denying people the right to live given certain political leanings vs at what point are we forcing people to spend money (servers, IT support, etc. ain’t free) to provide a platform for those people? Unrelated to politics, but more directly related to uncensored speech: Spez had a really interesting take on why Reddit banned the barelylegal subreddit: it was costing them more than any other subreddit since they had to have someone from Reddit monitor submissions, and they were losing good employees who would quit when they had to take over that role. This subreddit brought very little to the Reddit community as a whole, but hurt Reddit’s image and was unbelievably painful to deal with. Why should a private corporation have to hold that burden?

Rather than telling women that they should work harder and choose higher paying, more competitive careers, why not analyze a system that asks people to sacrifice their wellness and their families for more money? A just system would allow men and women to have healthy work-life balances and still be compensated fairly.

"Yeah id love too. well the pro is obvious everyone gets health care. People aren't neglected based on class and income to obtain treatment. Here are some cons : 1) Insurance companies approve medicine, when an insurance company doesn't approve of it you can fight it. Imagine the federal government not approving a medicine, it will be incredibly tough to fight. 2) being a doctor is incredibly tough. You go through 4 years of med school, 4 years of residency which pays 50k a year for 80 hour work weeks, and then fellow ship for another 4 years which is basically the same as residency. If medicare for all is approved, the wage of doctors will go down as the public sector usually lags behind the private in terms of wage. The amount of people wanting to go into medicine will decrease and the quality of doctors wont be the same. 3) 85 percent of diseases are from life style choices such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Should people be responsible for others life style choices? 4) The pure cost (OAC said 21 trillion a year but it increases every year just by population dynamics currently in the USA) and the increasing population, make medicare for all impossible to sustain without a loss of quality in medicine. its your choice, i personally think the cons out weigh the pros.

'Critics of the U.S. healthcare system use this comparison to argue that the United States is uniquely inefficient. They point out that life expectancy is higher in some nations that pay less for healthcare, such as Canada, France, and Japan.

Privatizing it and doing it through government.

Considering that often times it's impractical (or nearly impossible) to achieve these items just from earning points playing the game, I am very inclined to agree with your standpoint. However, I wonder if the courts will find these practices synonymous with gambling, and thus legally bound to the same types of laws. In my mind, when I think of gambling, I think of casinos or online poker/card games and such, where the prize is usually a pool of cash from other gamblers.

"Both parties had  That fateful year had the most electoral college vote defectors in American history: 7. And of the 7, Hillary lost 5 (three to Colin Powell, one to Bernie Sanders, and one to the Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle), and Trump 2 (to John Kasich and Ron Paul). I think it's disingenuous and a little biased to say any party or ideology has a monopoly on the faithless elector problem. In my scenario, it would only take two faithless electors (who are allowed to vote their conscience, not bullied into supporting Bernie in the end) to prevent Bernie from winning the Presidency. If he won the electoral college in Election Day and did not win the pledged electoral delegates, and did not become President when it was all settled, there would be chaos far, far worse than France's recent yellow vests. It would be an American constitutional crisis *par excellence*. (But it is also my belief that we only had so many faithless electors in 2016 because Trump's electoral victory was so decisive. Had it been a closer delegate election, I think we might've had 0-2 total faithless electors.) I do agree that Trump did not plan or want to win 2016. I think he set himself up for a win-win, expecting and hoping to lose. And I don't think he really wants to be President for another full term, either.

"There are 'three conflicting interpretations' only inasmuch as pro-abortion advocates need to find some means of justifying a heinous procedure that prematurely terminates human life. The only way to do this is to ignore the biological reality of 'life begins at conception' by kicking the can down the road from 'conception' to 'some point after conception, possibly before birth but potentially just at birth' for the sake of shifting discussion about abortion from 'it's always wrong to destroy human life' to 'when does life begin, anyway?' Introducing 'legality' as a way of 'trying to define when human life begins from a legal perspective' is asinine. All law is moral law. Philosophy is tied to legality, the two aren't separate - if they were, we wouldn't bother with the question of whether abortion is 'right' or 'wrong' because we would draw no moral equivalence for murder. Because murder (and other morally wrong acts, such as theft, assault, and even adultery in states with at-fault divorce) is philosophically 'wrong' we legislate it. Legislating against abortion is no more 'you shouldn't force your morals on others!' than legislating against murder. All law is compulsory morality and behind that morality are individual consciences; everyone who participates in public life through elections, et cetera, does so in a way that compels others to their moral views. This is why the 'don't bring your *philosophy* into this *strictly legal* discussion' is so ludicrous. You seem to want to introduce these 'really technical, sticky' situations (e.g. 'should nonimplantation of fertilized ova be treated as murder, legally speaking?') to confuse the matter when they have very simple answers (no, because no one was involved in an 'act' of murdering the child; death from nonimplantation results from natural processes, not artificial ones). Life begins at conception, and a fertilized ovum is a human life. Failing to implant doesn't change that reality. Miscarriages are tragedies, but they're not murder. Regarding ectopic pregnancies: Yes, as a consequence of removing a diseased organ the child may die, but that is not the intended result. The proximate cause of death for both mother and child in the case of an ectopic pregnancy would be *organ failure,* not surgical dismemberment, or any other type of abortive procedure (e.g. drug-induced termination of pregnancy). This isn't a difficult concept to grasp... Not being consequentialist is why one can discern between 'means' and 'ends' in moral acts. Because the 'ends' are the same, not all 'means' are equal. A gunshot wound and cancer may both result in death but only one results in charges being brought. As an accomplished legal scholar I'm sure you can spot the flaw in this kind of reasoning (sorry to poke fun, but you're really trying to cut low with some of your language), from which flows so much of your argument. As with a mother needing to 'defend' herself from a fetus - this is a rather lame argument when a mother's body is designed to carry a child to term, and an abortion is an intervention to prevent it from so doing. You seem to believe fetuses are parasitic, or are capable of assault? This ignores the biological reality of what men and women are designed to do in the reproduction of human life. Talk about semantics, you seem to be asserting that passage through a vaginal canal is what defines human life? ",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

"Yep, they are. Too bad you didn't include any. You provided predictions and subjective interpretations. Here's how to tell something is a prediction, ie not facts. I included many. You just chose not to read them. That’s on you. 3 million + jobs added Correct. But as I wrote in my original reply simply citing a statistic means nothing without context and analysis. Unless you’re an ideologue. 3 million jobs sounds great, but what percentage of these jobs are attributed to actions of the current administration? What was the data trending towards? How many of these jobs pay well? How many are full time? How have wages paced with inflation? These are just some of the millions of questions you can ask. There are also questions about taking a broad lens and ignoring micro analysis. The experiences in New York may differ greatly from those in Wisconsin. Simply throwing out a number, sans context is the attempt of an ideologue. Anyone can toss out a number that means nothing to make anyone look good. You clearly understand this but you won’t admit it since you’re an idealogue. Women, African Americans and Latinos are employed more now then they have been in decades. Which I addressed in my reply. You chose to ignore. This is 100% a talking point. Being employed is nice but being employed doesn’t mean you’re wealthy. It doesn’t mean you own a home or have savings. It doesn’t mean you have a pension or health care. It doesn’t mean racism has now ended. Unemployment is at record lows, that’s a fact. This is due to a number of factors, not just a strong economic growth but also the boomers leaving the work force. I stated this and more in my last reply. The claim you’re trying to make is that Trump is not a racist or sexist Minorities and women have low unemployment Trump is president = trump loves women and blacks = Trump is the best I don’t take issue with your facts. But more so the implications you’re trying to draw. And a resonable person has some questions. - what has trump done to tackle minority inequality? - what has trump done to reduce minority unemployment? - what other factors affect minority well being than employment? - how are wages distributed amongst minorities? There’s more questions... so many more. But that’s the problem with you.

"Not really. Laws require clear definitions. Well, the clearer the definitions of terms, the better the laws. Defining life as beginning at conception leads to the problem of how to classify fertilized ova which fail to implant on the uterine wall. Are those ova which the woman expells then deaths under the law? Certainly they're deaths in terms of biology, but are they ***human deaths*** for which the law should remain indifferent? More to the point, defining life as beginning at conception would require special consideration for ectopic pregnancies which would kill the mother way before the fetus could become viable. Would abortions in such cases be banned because the fetus was a life? Or would the mother be allowed to exercise the Common Law right to self-defense? If self-defense is an acceptable reason for abortion, could anything else be such as late manifesting deformities which mean less than, say, 10% probability of live birth and 0% probability such a live-born baby would live more than 1 week? In any event, we're talking about the law. Right now the law in the US allows relatively unrestricted access to abortions at least in the first half of pregnancy. Implicit in that is that the law currently DOES NOT define fetuses in the first half of pregnancy as human life protected by law. If you were just discussing your own personal preferences, don't worry: no one here would prevent you all from carrying your pregnancies to term. However, I suspect your agenda is to require all others to carry their pregnancies to term. Thus compulsion, thus law, so legal definitions are both appropriate AND ESSENTIAL to this discussion. If this were only an academic moral discussion, then perhaps viability might be extrinsic. But that's not the case, is it? If I have to be clearer, I'll try. To me religious or philosophical definitions of ***life*** are superfluous. As for scientific definitions, I figure you won't get consensus among bio PhDs or MDs that conception is the beginning of life except in the most expansive sense that there's cell division. A practical, legal definition of life requires consideration of viability. So, no, from my perspective a fetus at, say, 12 weeks isn't a manifested human life. It's a lot further along than a fertilized ovum, but still not there.",t3_a1phfa,moderatepolitics

When those metrics are determined by location, popularity, relevance, key words, and history, then they are being determined by an objective metric. That is the service which they are providing.

While this is at times a difficult element to satisfy, ***examples of evidence supporting the element include***: (a) an attempt to disguise or conceal financial activity regulated by FECA; (b) ***status or prior experience as a campaign official, candidate, professional fundraiser, or lawyer***\*;\* and (c) efforts by campaigns to notify contributors of applicable campaign finance law (e.g., donor card warnings).

If left unchecked, entire cultural institutions will emerge based around these predictable social fissures. It is trivial for attackers to exploit these tendencies. I see racism as a disability, often co-morbid with poverty, and that the most vile and pernicious racism often flows from privileged people who only believe that racism exists in a mythologized class of *other* that they share fantasies of themselves engaged in heroic battles against. Racism rarely looks like the caricatures depicted on television news, and quite often like the person we see in the mirror. I care deeply about the cause of uniting people in spite of their differences, and feel that through mutual exposure and vulnerability real progress can be made. I think the best way to harmonize large groups of people is to provide them with a vested stake in the future. I think nothing provides a greater platform for that than a system that we can all perceive based on the evidence of our own experience as benefiting us all. I emphasize systemic racism in our criminal justice system for this reason. We are great as a nation, by many objective measures and international standards, but still have tremendous ground to cover---and we can lead the world. I feel more or less that is what .

He also said that Trump's comments in Iraq make it sound like he wants to use Iraq as a jumping off point if we need to do anything further with Syria, and this Iraq expert said that he wishes he wouldn't do that because Iraq gets touchy about their territory being used as a staging area for the US to conduct missions in other countries.

"The two are not necessarily in conflict. There are a lot of apple to orange comparisons going on. If we assume all of the statements are true (which I am doing only for the sake of argument) then we can potentially resolve as follows: The study looks at non-citizens on welfare, but single undocumented residents aren't as easily able to *get* welfare because they are undocumented. So while residents with visas are applying for assistance, workers who have no status are taking nothing but still either paying taxes in the form of sales taxes, or helping business profits which in turn pay more taxes. Meanwhile, those who have anchor babies can probably transition from undocumented to having a visa, allowing them to get welfare for their household. So the proportion of undocumented workers who are a net benefit stays high. The concept of 'non citizen household' is the real key here, because it means a child who gets government assistance is treated as getting it on behalf of the household. Ironically, if that assistance works as intended and the child grows up and becomes a productive taxpaying member, the child leaves the household and starts a new, non-immigrant one. Children for whom the assistance does not meaningfully change their lives likely remain with their parents. Thus you'll see a very high concentration of assistance 'not working' because of all the conflation of households and individuals. As a second reconciliation, the 35 percent of non-citizens who are not on welfare could be putting in quite a bit of taxes. I came down to the USA on a visa myself, I'm a Green Card holder, and I've paid about half a million dollars in taxes alone in the seven years I've lived here. That probably covers a lot of welfare checks. I'm probably an outlier but visas granted to skilled workers are usually for incomes well above the average citizen.",t3_a3qmau,moderatepolitics

This has been pitched by various politicians since my childhood (I grew up in the 90s and no one was shy about invoking the trade deficit bogeyman in response to NAFTA). Here's Bernie Sanders on the topic back in 1997: The US currently has a trade deficit of $114 billion. Economists tell us that $1 billion of investment equates to about 18,000 (often decent-paying) jobs. Connect the dots. Our current trade deficit is causing the loss of over 2 million jobs. Over the last 20 years, while the US has run up over a trillion dollars in trade deficits, millions of American workers have been thrown into the streets. This is been fed to folks for decades. The American public (or at least a large portion of it) is conditioned to believe that 'deficits' are bad. Trade deficits included. What the public doesn't understand is that trade deficits aren't bad. This is the position of most economists on the matter. So we're dealing with an education problem here: the public believes trade deficits are bad. This is where Trumps rhetoric actually gets its power.

For this the president most embroiled in scandal would have to be Clinton with Whitewater when he did something lighthearted and fun like play the saxophone at a state dinner it was covered in Good humor. Neither of them ever made policies that directly killed 7 year olds, Trump's policies directly do this, no other US president has setup prison camps for children. He made impossible promises about his stupid wall and other things, he's obviously motivated by hatred and bigotry on multiple topics (see his history with black and blind eviction), even most conservatives I know dislike his tax and medical policies. Trump is the lowest kind of human being and has been given every advantage in life. What does he do with his improve stature? He has a long history of using it for cruelty.

Abortion is a right that was established through a court decision (in the US). Changes to the law regarding abortion has to be consistent with that decision. Some of the distinctions that you are proposing (such as distinguishing between married and unmarried parents and granting a 3rd party rights in the decision) are in conflict with the basis that establishes abortion rights, and with other fundamental legal principles that deal with how rights are consistently established and protected. If this is your 'if I ruled the world' vision, that's one thing, but I think there are some subtleties involved that can't be ignored. Fundamentally, to me it seems disingenuous to argue that a father has an equal stake in a pregnancy, given that he doesn't have to face the risk of death, permanent incapacity, or loss of fertility. If 100% of the risk and harm is born by one party, giving the other party veto and requiring legal maneuvering for the at-risk party to assert their rights seems backwards.

">Democratic Socialist darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Friday said fellow progressives’ and her election victory – in an overwhelmingly Democratic district – was akin to the 1969 moon landing and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. >“We've done what we thought was impossible,” she told a crowd during an event hosted by an environmental group, the Sunshine Movement, that aims to combat climate change. >“We went to the moon. We electrified the nation. We established civil rights. We enfranchised the country. We dig deep, and we did it. We did it when no one else thought that we could. That's what we did when so many of us won an election this year,” Ocasio-Cortez added. For me this article points to what I consider to be a growing issue in this country (other than the media's misrepresentation of the truth, something this article does its fair share of too) So many people look to frame what they are doing as some monumental moment in history. Protestors today think of themselves as civil rights activists.

"...To be a conservative means to be a marginalized voice, suppressed and dehumanized; bullied into hesitating to speak out. That sounds exactly like my experience being liberal in otherwise conservative leaning groups. For example I enjoy shooting guns for sport, and appreciate my rights to carry them. This brings me in constant contact with others who are quick to assume that I want to take away those rights. It's almost as if most people, no matter their political leanings, are intolerant, and unwilling to consider ideas that differ from their own. The complaint was that, by being openly gay, I was provoking people who were happier not being confronted with something uncomfortable to them. Today I hear the same things when I see conservatives express concern over censorship and the left dismisses us as hateful bigots upset that our intolerant worldview is disappearing from society. Or maybe they just disagree? The fact that your various views are met with disapproval does not mean that this rejection stems from the same cause. It sucks, but I'm sure that some people are made uncomfortable by overt homosexuality; that doesn't necessarily mean that their dislike for your politics is related to their lack of comfort with conservative ideals. We find no compassion from our adversaries. In fact, we see them champion silencing us permanently. Again, I argue that the tendency to silence one's opponents is a global crutch, not one monopolized by the left. Despite the wide range in differences in style, subject matter, and presentation between Milo and many of us on the right, the left does not see much distinction. Yes, and I see so much appreciation for the nuance of my personal views in /r/CCW when I mention that I'm liberal or left-leaning. This is how generalities and stereotypes work. Sucks, but it's not an exclusive facet of liberal views. But just as I did not choose to be gay, I did not choose to be conservative. My political evolution happened over time as I came to realize that I valued truth and reason over narrative and emotion. And now we're just making stuff up and dismissing alternative beliefs. Let's hope that someday I, too, can realize The Truth, eschewing my obviously emotionally motivated reasoning (/s). Homosexuality is biological, and the author diminishes this fact when equating it with their own 'political evolution,' doing a disservice to the group that he purports to represent.

"Oh boy, let me go one by one: >First your remittance numbers are low, but then again when you cite CNN as a source of information that isn't surprising. >Here's some more accurate information sourced from Banco De Mexico:  That's funny, because if you look at the CNN article, **_they also cite the Bank of Mexico's numbers_** from January to November 2017. In fact, they even say: >Trump specifically threatened to slap a tax on Mexican remittances to pay for his proposed border wall. Economists say that particular threat has also encouraged Mexicans to send money home before any restrictions are put in place. which perfectly explains why those numbers might have increased; even if the number is now $33B, it doesn't change the fact that any wall-tax would have to be very high. But if you want to keep flaming CNN, go ahead. Your views as to rather it is racist or not are likewise irrelevant. Having viable borders is a foundational element of maintaining a nation and if you believe it is somehow racist for countries to do so, I wish you the best with that opinion. I am not objecting to the numeric viability of taxing remittances as a method of paying for the wall. I'm telling you that it is not going to happen because: * It's not 'making Mexico pay for it,' because it's a tax on American citizens and is therefore stupid * It's taxing American citizens on the basis of their national origin and is therefore illegal * It's building a wall, which is not a necessary part of border enforcement, and is therefore unnecessary Further there are quite a lot of LEGAL Hispanic (and other) immigrants that aren't too excited about all of the people that are here illegally. Even were that the metric we were to agree on, there's really no way of determining the net support until it is done. It is called 'polling' and pretty clearly shows that a majority of Americans think that the wall is a waste of money. If you are going to flame polling as fake news, I can't really argue with you.

"I read through the sources and I'll try to summarize my understanding. Currently, there's a requirement that people need to be enrolling in at least 20 hours per week of job training (or be working) in order to be eligible for food stamps beyond a three month period. States are currently allowed to waive that requirement if their unemployment rate is more that 20% above the natural rate, which is 3.7% in the United States. So, under current rules, any state with over 4.44% unemployment can waive the work/training requirements tied to receiving food stamps. The proposal from Trump wants to raise the unemployment rate criteria for that up to 7%, and this would allegedly disqualify 700,000 people for food stamps. The Christmas part is the icing on the cake, who doesn't love a good grinch story? This doesn't seem like the end of the world to me, we're currently in a low unemployment period, 3.7% unemployment is historically low. The spirit behind the '20% above natural' idea, I think, is that states with struggling economic zones would get more help, but when the country as a whole has low unemployment, raising that bar makes sense. Unemployment as an excuse for needing Federal assistance stops holding water when rates sit at 3.7%.

Since the LGBT rights movement truly began in the 70's, the right as a whole has been absolutely horrendous towards us.

With that type of history of hostility and slander, it at least raises questions in my mind when a gay person is willing to label themselves as conservative. Why are they willing to support a movement with so many people in it that hate them? Also, a good chunk of gay conservatives are very much of the 'fuck you, got mine' attitude towards trans people.

Second, a large amount of people aren't getting accurate information and are being rational actors with what they have.

"I think one major thing would be stronger laws about overtime wages. Salaried employees are often working more than 40hrs/weekly without getting paid more because their job is expected to come with 80hrs/week of labour and an unspoken rule that only those who work toxic amounts like that will ever progress. Perhaps overtime should also pay more to incentivize companies hiring more people rather than paying the overtime. Paid parental leave should also be given to both parents and not be transferable (use it and spend time with your new family or lost it). You could also raise the wages for the types of jobs that women do that come with lots of hazards. Women do work less deadly jobs but nursing (which has the highest rate of nonfatal injury) and social work are often hazardous jobs too with high injury rates from actual violence (including long term issues like contracting of disease). (Also tbh logging is a bad example because they don't make good money despite being so deadly and that whole industry needs to be upturned because it is nonsense that people - mostly men - are risking that much for $40,000/yr.)

"Overtime isn’t causing the wage gap. Men choose overtime and women don’t. That’s causing the wage gap. Women would close the gap if they chose overtime more often. They literally controlled for every aspect. Single women with no dependents choose overtime less than single men with no dependents. The study shows that the wage gap is caused by men and women having different priorities. Feminism doesn’t like that. It needs women to be oppressed to keep academic and political feminists in jobs. The implicit statement that chasing money over everything else as men do is the preferred status quo is pretty reprehensible. First, it was that the wage gap was caused by systemic sexism. Then, we proved it wasn’t sexism, but women’s decisions. Now, we’re attacking the data by misrepresenting while simultaneously ***heavily*** implying that women are making the “wrong” choices by not chasing wealth like men do. Modern third wave feminism requires a patriarchal foundation to exist. Your comment is proof positive. The study showed what every other study of its kind has shown: the wage gap is explained by personal choices made by women. So, how about we acknowledge that women have the agency to make decisions based on their own priorities. And maybe we can admit that chasing wealth over all else probably isn’t the better option.

"Let's start with this, from the article, it's about campaign finance reform, something Trump campaigned on (Drain the Swamp), and Democrats have campaigned on: >A Pew Research poll from May found that 77 percent of Americans favor “limits on the amount of money individuals and organizations” can spend on campaigns. (This includes 71 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.) Sixty-five percent believe that new laws could effectively reduce the influence of money in politics. Now, let's look at a Mitch McConnell, who is the Senate Majority Leader and is who decides what house bills make it to the senate. He is a staunch opponent of campaign finance reform, and he has some good points. Political speech is free speech. But the, as it currently stands, bill being proposed by the incoming House, seeks to strengthen individual donations for lower income people, while also trying to limit the influence of lobbyists, and create more disclosure rules for Super PACs. I, like McConnell, have reservations about the disclosure part. And based off our previous discussions I bet you do to. Fortunately the senate has the ability to alter a bill, and send it back down. But the assumption here is, McConnell will flat out refuse to bring it before the senate at all. Thereby superceding the desire of 77% of the American population. This issue is clearly an issues that both sides care deeply about, as consensus on this issue is higher than damn near any issue in this country. It's very rare in today's world for such a high consensus to be found on a issue. So the question to you is: At what point would obstructing a campaign finance reform bill be grounds for the constituency of the GOP to push their representatives to replace McConnell as the Senate Majority Leader should he govern in line with all of his prior choices and positions: IE: Opposing any and all Campaign Finance Reform measures, and block any bill from reaching the senate floor for debate.

">It's not actually the case that women are joining tech fields more and more. At least not with respect to computer science. CS, yes. There are other issues at play. Have you tried seeing what women in these fields say? It does not confirm your suspicions. . >It is also generally well known that gender gaps in certain fields are wider in more egalitarian countries. If you actually look at the tables, you see that the data is *just all over the fucking place*. The study you linked is a poor representative too, look at their sample sizes! NINE?! >It's almost as if, when women are able to exercise greater freedom of choice, inherent gender differences in preference become more apparent in the aggregate. This is a much stronger statement, on par with me saying 'hormones play no role'. The data fits the theory, but that's not the way science goes. At best you can say 'preference is not entirely cultural, or perhaps Scandinavian and Northern European countries aren't great controls for whatever issues are happening in the US.' >Now that women (in western countries at least) can be lawyers, doctors, etc. we see women moving disproportionately away from computer science. The much simpler explanation is that women in the 80's who were old enough to be professionals were brought up in the 60's, before things like the toy-isle-gender disparity impacted participation rates for girls and boys in tech activities. Girls in the 80's grew up in that environment and unsurprisingly are not now in CS. It's not perfect, but there are other trends going on besides the liberalization of the workforce for doctors. >The point of including individuals with CAH in the analysis was to control for exogenous variables. They are women with the developmental androgen exposure of typical males. Despite being socialized as women I think that's a tricky thing you just said. Even among women and men, within the cohorts, there are different kinds of socialization. Masculine women raised as tomboys would likely have a different set of constructed preferences than feminine women raised as delicate snowflakes. That was my point. It's a huge assumption to say that you've controlled for culture *after years of culture having an impact* to your final outcome. >However, it's not automatically the case that every gender gap is caused by discrimination. Sure. What we have is women complaining of gender discrimination in STEM fields, actual proof that it does happen and is more widespread than in other fields (hence why women quit the tech industry to go elsewhere), and actual concrete statistical evidence that there is an outcome disparity. To rush to find evidence that discrimination is a minor factor seems... driven. >Would you say that men are discriminated against in medicine because they make up 54% of internal medicine doctors but only 15% of OBGYNs? I know for a fact that soft discrimination occurs against men trying to be OB/GYNs. *Women aren't comfortable going to male doctors* a lot of the time for their bits. We can talk about whether that's justified but it *does exist*. >but it also could be true that women, more than men, make the entirely rational choice that the marginal income is not worth the loss of work-life balance and other sacrifices that need to be made to climb the ladder. This doesn't at all explain why women seem to know something men don't. I for one don't think that's the case. In a vacuum, we would expect some distribution of preferences in human brains that would predispose some to be wiling to forego worklife balance for pay and some not to. Pepper gender in there and *then* explain a model that tells me why one gender is more predisposed to a certain preference distribution, don't go the opposite way. But more to the point, >r maybe we should recognize that there are entirely rational reasons not to join that rat-race and consider that, for some reason, men are worse at making the right call in that arena. It could be choice, not discrimination. This has farther reaching outcomes than just pay. Whenever a group is marginalized from positions of authority in a society, they receive overall worse outcomes and smaller choice. That's not good for a whole *host* of reasons. It's why I'm interested in seeing the fruits borne of countries like Namibia or Rwanda where, at least in government, parity is achieved or exceeded. It's hard getting good scientific controls, but we can gather data and look at outcomes in societies with radically different arrangements of genders in positions of authority.

It is an unintended (i.e. *not* deliberate) consequence. Again with the consequentialist arguments. These are the fatal flaws in your reasoning. Of course, I was using the word 'organ failure' to indicate that a diseased organ, usually the fallopian tube, needs to be removed in the course of treatment for ectopic pregnancies. The child dies as a result of removal of a diseased organ, not as a result of direct surgical intervention to kill it. This is not abortion. Abortion is the deliberate termination of human life e.g. surgical dismemberment, et cetera. A woman's body, when functioning properly, is designed to carry a pregnancy to term. Only when functioning improperly (and therefore in need of some medical intervention, as with an ectopic pregnancy) is medical intervention necessary. I'm glad you agree, and can see why abortions are unnecessary. I'm not desperately avoiding anything. The scenarios and arguments you're presenting aren't difficult to sort out in a consistent manner and have straightforward answers.

You have to write up your report when it's fresh in your mind, the very fact that they didn't even bother to write one in the first place shows how little they thought of the conversation. Without that original 302 report, your dangerously walking the line of fruit of the poisonous tree. Mueller attempted to bypass this whole discovery process by recommending Flynn get no jail time. But the Judge saw things differently and demanded Mueller turn over the 302 report, the only reason we know the original doesn't exist, and this quasi fake one was created 7 months later is because of court filings that Judge Emmitt Sullivan requested. 302 reports have a maximum of 5 days to file, many cases are thrown out if they aren't filed within 72 hours. Legally and ethically, filling a 302 report 7 months after the fact is pretty damn alarming. Comey says he read the 302 report, which would have been the original, the 302 report filed with the court was written after Comey was fired....someone is lying. How can Comey read a 302 report that apparently never existed? Or one was written and it was destroyed. And if you need some background on Emmit Sullivan in question....he over turned Ted Stevens conviction in Alaska due to political bias and prosecution misconduct. He is no stranger to the abuses of power. And we got a pretty good glaring one in this case.",t3_a6vvoc,moderatepolitics

"Excellent post! **First to any others: Gambling is an addiction. For some, too many, gambling is fucking heroin.** I never dealt with baseball cards, but cards changed value over time depending on the player, so there’s that. Not sure modern game cards have the same possibility? Apparently the rush from gambling and buying cards must not be the same since I don’t recall any stories of people bankrupting themselves buying cards, but I personally know several that casinos have ruined. So are loot boxes addictive like casino gambling? I would guess for some. Enough to be concerned. More so for children with lower impulse control. Maybe it won’t condition them and they’ll grow out of it. Is it worth that risk? Maybe it’s the mechanics of it. I don’t play any games with them. If you can buy get loot boxes as fast as you can feed a slot machine, there surely is the same kind of addictive possibility. Honestly I think loot boxes prey on our wish to fit in and be respected.

"Sure, I'd love to expand on it. Thanks for asking. I don't think it is a position, but how you approach your position and approach others from your position. Let's take an example. I'm a anti-capitalist but I feel that I have more in common with a libertarian who's willing to discuss the issue with me in good faith, who earnestly believes their perspective is the best way to help the most amount of people, and who's as willing to listen to my perspective as I am to theirs, than I do with another anti-capitalist who just wants to grunt about eating the rich and using their position to further their own personal power. I think a moderate is someone who accepts complexity (seeks it, even), someone who's firmly 'de-camped' themselves, who does not necessarily occupy political territory because they are wary of the stultification that inevitably results from doing so. Being a moderate is about how you interact with your reality, and others, more so than any particular belief. Most importantly, perhaps, a moderate is ready to be wrong. I want to be effective more than I want to be right. Being wrong suuuuuuucks. It hurts, every time, but if I'm not willing to be wrong, I'm no help to the rest of my people. And since I'm a humanist first and foremost, all people are my people. This is the first time I've written this out so thanks for understanding that this is not as cohesive as I would like it to be.

Are the rules particularly lax? On the topic of immigration rate, the US isn't anomalous among western countries; their absolute numbers are high, but so is their total population. The US is the third most populous country, behind only India and China. If you sum up the immigrant population percentages from all EU countries , you can see that the EU's total of the global immigrant population is around 23%. That is a lower per-capita amount than the US' ~20%, but if you look at the wealthier EU countries like Germany, the UK, France, or the Netherlands, you can see that immigrants make up a similar percentage of their total population.

"I'd prefer since over the legal definition; you started with a legal definition, which is sort of my point. It also answers your question(s) regarding deciding how to legally classify the ending of that life; since legally it is not a human, the ending of that human life by miscarriage (generally), non-implantation, etc doesn't get a trip to the ME or coroner to determine the cause of death. Of course, if the mother causes a miscarriage by say, drug abuse, there are states which can prosecute that. By the same token, if a criminal act harms a fetus (that the mother has decided is a human, i.e. is a wanted pregnancy) the criminal can be charged with additional counts of crime. That doesn't make the legal definition particularly coherent, but again the legal aspect isn't the issue. It ignores the science. If a fetus is not a human life, what is it? Non-human, or non-life? It would be great if the legal system and the culture took into account the fact of life, but since the legal system has decided that the life is 'sub-human,' much of the culture is willing to go along with it.
