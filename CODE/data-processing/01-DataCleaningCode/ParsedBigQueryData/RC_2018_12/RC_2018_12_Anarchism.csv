">committing mass genocide on a simply unthinkable level Yikes. There's a difference between 'not loving Stalin' and 'spewing anti-communist propaganda on a communist subreddit'. Are you going to tell us that Stalin killed 100 million people? He was no friend of anarchists and did a lot wrong, but it doesn't really help any leftist to regurgitate the exaggerated or unfounded propaganda surrounding the USSR in a leftist place that's obviously going to ban you for doing it, then coming here to complain. You're being intentionally antagonistic/divisive. Edit: Good job, my anarchist dudes! Get angry at /r/communism for being a ML echo chamber/circlejerk, then turn around and downvote me for dissenting here! Get angry at liberals for slurping up their propaganda, but believe Cold War propaganda that implies Stalin was a worse-than-Hitler supervillain! You anarchists are just so much smarter than those dumb MLs/liberals, aren't you all? Also love the 'just saying the truth, just stating the facts' circlejerk, like anarchists are the only people who know the 100% true facts and aren't afraid to say it. Sounds like some twisted leftist form of enlightened centrism, or just plain old liberalism. For the record, I am an anarchist, and I've been banned on /r/socialism (for what, I don't know, the mods never told me) and /r/latestagecapitalism (for criticising the DPRK). I've been active on leftist subs for years. I'm not a brocialist or a tankie or any weird anarchist shit like anprim/ancap. It's easier for me to just spew out stuff in a big edit than write out replies so I'm just going to do that.  (which are obviously still going to be biased against an even nominally socialist regime), the Soviet administration under Stalin caused roughly 6-9 million deaths (out of a population of 140-180 million over a time period of 30 years). They also usually don't categorise most of those deaths as expressly genocidal in nature. Many were due to famine (in a region that had historically experienced several famines, and which was troubled by strong political turmoil over its rapid collectivisation/industrialisation). Many deaths (up to 6 million) were also squarely the fault of Stalin and the Bolsheviks -- it's no secret that things like the Cheka and the Gulag system existed, and that events like the Great Purge happened. Was Stalin a 'good guy', in any particular sense? No, not to me at least. Were there, at the least, millions of deaths under his leadership? Yes. Were a significant proportion of those deaths intentional and/or preventable? Yes. Was he directly responsible for 'massive genocide on a simply unthinkable level'? Fuck no. You'd have to be an idiotic liberal drinking the anti-communist koolaid to even think of saying that. Saying that also devalues one of the only people in history who could *actually* be described like that -- Hitler. Hitler planned his genocide for years (or decades), and he *industrialised* his genocide. Hitler's genocide was *actually* 'unthinkable' -- as in, the Allies were utterly shocked when they came upon places like Auschwitz because they never could have imagined what the Nazis were actually doing. 'Exiling/killing all his friends' is also just laughable, like Stalin is an actual James Bond villain or Saturday morning cartoon villain or some shit. 'Stalin was so evil that he even killed all his friends!' Seriously? Did he kill/exile people? Yes, and that's bad. But he wasn't some evil inhuman monster that decided 'you know what, these people are my literal friends, but fuck that, I'm going to kill/exile them because I'm a bad guy'. He had falling-outs with political allies who ended up being political rivals, he ended up killing/exiling some of them who he considered a threat, again that's bad but that's not him literally doing it to his friends. And what is really the goal of saying stuff like this? It's a known fact that /r/communism is primarily an ML sub, so what did OP expect by going in there and saying some hyperbolic shit like that? Why is OP acting surprised and running here like some great and unexpected tragedy has happened? All it does is play into the anti-communist handbook by further reinforcing the idea that 'communism killed 100 million people', while sowing needless division between different groups of leftists that are already divided enough. That's not to say we should just let MLs do/say whatever they want in the name of 'left unity', but it's just to say that we shouldn't start pointless counterproductive shitflinging like this. It also goes without saying that many capitalist administrations have killed as many or even more people than Stalin, but which aren't put to anywhere near the same level of scrutiny as Stalin's regime (because the goal of doing this is to ignore deaths under capitalism, while linking Stalin = evil guy who killed millions, to Stalin = communist leader of communist country, to communism = evil and kills millions). Why as leftists, even non-ML leftists, do we also tend to be focused on Stalin? Why go to a ML sub to start shit about Stalin, rather than going to a liberal sub to start shit about someone like Churchill? It, again, also goes without saying that these MLs have already heard anything you've got to say about Stalin ten times over. They've heard he's responsible for 10 million, 20 million, 100 million. They've heard he's not much better than Hitler, just as bad as Hitler, worse than Hitler. Even if it's all completely true and Stalin is a cartoonishly-evil supervillain, it's pointless to keep flinging this shit at them -- they're simply not going to learn anything from it, and neither are you. But most liberals actually are ignorant as to how much death and suffering capitalism has been responsible for. Everyone on Reddit circlejerks about the Holodomor, but far fewer people know as much about an event like the Bengal famine -- which killed at least as many people and was more likely genocidal in nature. The difference? The Holodomor is pushed a lot by anti-communists so they can say 'see, communism killed millions', while the Bengal famine was the fault of capitalism/imperialism (arguably the direct fault of Churchill, a historical figure liberals love to worship) so it gets swept under the rug.",t3_a7giuo,Anarchism

Because it will teach them not to break the law again. That's authoritarianism to you. Trusting that an authority (in this case, the police) does the right thing, without question. That there is one correct, absolute morality, which is being enforced by these authorities. That excessive violence is a just punishment for people who don't follow this absolute authority, and by extension, violate the absolute morality. That's why authoritarianism is so harmful.

"i did not say that someone who is not prorojava canot be pro ezln. Now, about the diference of EZLN and Rojava. Rojava is not a socialist revolution, and here are some of the reasons. In rojava, there is private property, and the big land owners that did not immigraded from syria during the war, are still there. If you read their constitution, you may see some socialist things about their political line, but when the question comes in economic and classes, guess what, its the same words that the western constitutions have. And the biggest, as i said before, their number one ally, is US, the parent of capitalism in earth. So following simple plain 1st grade mathematical skills, if the father of capitalism founds something, then this something is propably not counter to it. It seems illogical and hypocritical to me that some anarchists are supporting rojava, but not the commies, on the basis that when the commies are left in economics, are statist in politics, but the rojava, is the one that is not statist? No. So, we have communists, that are statist and anti bourgeoisie and socialist, and you have rojava, that is statist, non-socialist, puppy of USA, and left only in politics(women rights for example, that communists also support enyway, and capitalists also support...).

"This is 100% true. Like 90% of the middle class in America do not have outrageous healthcare costs because they have insurance which pays for it. The actual after-tax take home income of middle class Americans far exceeds that of the French middle class, and the prices on everything from housing to food to Sales tax are way way higher in France than in the US. That’s why the French middle class is rioting. The US doesn’t spend that much money on defense. The US spends 3.5% of GDP on Defense. France’s public spending is over 50% of GDP and France itself spends 2% of GDP on defense. The defense part of the budget is peanuts here in both countries. >It gives insane tax breaks which is not spending, but it may as well be. That many should be going to all of us in the form of social services, infrastructure, the other billion things we need. And France gives insane tax burden to its middle class. This isn’t a morality tale. France’s middle class is rioting because it’s fucked compared to the US middle class. US taxes are way, way, more progressive on the rich than in France. US has a 15% payroll tax, France has 50%, that’s even before we get into income tax brackets. In France 50% of your gross pay is taken out of your pocket before it even gets to you, then you pay normal income tax on what you do get. Then France has sales tax rates of 20% compared to average of like 6% in the US. It’s a tax squeeze at all levels The US gives huge tax breaks to the middle class. Things like the mortgage interest deduction for home ownership, the earned income tax credit, the exemption on capital gain from the sale of you personal home for average and low valued houses. These are middle class tax breaks France doesn’t have on top of what is already a more progressive US income tax system",t3_a67p5f,Anarchism

"Hello friend! I too had a very similar journey. Kicked out at 17, became homeless and addicted to drugs. Was always keenly interested in anarchism and radical politics in general, then got swept up into the occupy movement. Lots of things (both good and bad) to be said about that movement, but on a personal level it helped me kick a lot of bad habits and for the first time in my life, made me feel like there was really a fight worth fighting. I’m sure you probably have already, but if you haven’t - get involved with some other radicals. Whether it’s just a DIY venue or a co-op or an anarchist collective, it’s so important to have partners on this journey. Fight the good fight, don’t lose hope (you will inevitably at points), and one thing that’s really hit me these past few years - don’t be afraid to evolve and adapt. Don’t let others gatekeep what is/isn’t anarchist and other semantic bullshit like that. While camaraderie and community are vital to anarchism and radical politics in general, at the end of the day anarchism is for the individual.

If your goal is trying to get more socialists, you need *diversity of tactics*, let alone of people. Who the hell are you to tell a community of color to fall in line with the DSA? Are you organizing in the hood? What--you want black folks to seek out white organizers? Are you really so daft to not see how ineffective that would be? Eventually, sure, there's always a hope for larger scale unity on the left. We won't get there until the word socialism means what we know it to mean to every community.

"IMO, the most *common* arguments against anarchism and socialism aren’t really arguments. They tend to be things like “the Nazis were socialists” and “what about (insert non-socialist country)” and *occasionally* “what about (actual failed socialists/anarchists that were totally “not” crushed in their early stages through the concentrated effort of fascists and capitalists.)” The only counter arguments are facts, and people that use these “arguments” are not interested in facts. I’ve literally quoted three dictionaries and an encyclopedia to someone making these arguments and they insisted that they didn’t *really* say what they said. “I reject your reality and substitute my own.” is very difficult to counter.

"I make a grip of filthy capital harassing maga chuds and stealing their money for $5k auto warranties that cover literally nothing. It's called illegalism and it rocks.

We went over her finances together, and we agreed she won't be able to pay her membership dues at her senior center or whatever anymore. Friday I sold a policy to a fucking ACTIVE DUTY pig in Columbus Ohio. Gave him a 'discount' too. The fact is we call mostly the South, and if you are dumb enough to buy my shit then you probably voted Trump. Every single one of them says 'god bless' at least once.

"The bourgeois media started out very sympathetic several weeks ago when the movement was confused and could be interpreted as a petit-bourgeois kind of thing (which tbh I thought too at the time and so did many french leftists, hence why it took so long for them to get involved). They thought it could be coopted I guess, or understood/reframed within a petit-bourgeois 'muh big state' kind of thing. Now they are properly scared. Like actually. They are trying to devide 'legitimate greviances' and 'good protesters' from 'extreme infiltration'. I heard from france info tv the word 'class warfare is back'. Like shit I heard a right winger say the only solution is to dissolve parliament and have new parliamentary elections to avoid a repeat of may 1968. They aren't so much using the horseshoe thing, its not all that common in french political discourse. There its more framed as 'extremes' vs non extremes, and protestors vs 'casseurs' (breakers/rioters).

">In my opinion, any argument made in favor of capitalism that could also be made in favor of feudalism or state socialism ought to be discarded. All three are authoritarian systems where non-coerced agreements between worker and ruler are impossible due to massive power imbalances. Authoritarian implies state authority, and lies on the opposite end of the social axis of the political spectrum when compared to anarcho-capitalist political philosophy. The economic left, and economic right spectrum is what best defines capitalism in my opinion. Capitalism only grants authority over ones self, and ownership over ones property. In no place does it grant authority over human beings, which is what separates it from the feudalism. state socialism, etc. We can only agree if we both define capitalism as 'the voluntary exchange of goods and services between individuals' if that's not your definition that's fine, but for the sake of discussion just replace the word capitalism with the quoted phrase so there's no misunderstanding, because that's what I intend to communicate. >Merit does not justify tyranny. I'm sure Stalin worked hard and used a great deal of talent to seize control of the USSR. Does his merit justify his position? If not, then why does merit justify the capitalist's position? >Social mobility does not justify tyranny. Under feudalism a peasant could be knighted or marry into the nobility. Under state socialism you just need to become a party bureaucrat or develop some skill that makes you more highly valued. Regardless, the ability to move from exploited worker to tyrant does not matter to me. >Inheritance does not justify tyranny. If someone who never worked a day in their life gets a piece of paper from a dead relative that says they own a factory/feudal plot, and that numerous workers have to enrich them to avoid risk of starvation through leaving their job/fleeing, why should I respect that piece of paper? If instead of inheritance that capitalist/noble worked hard to obtain their position, that goes back to the merit argument above. >Risk does not justify tyranny. Every time the capitalist invests, they risk losing that investment. Every time a bureaucrat tries to climb the party's hierarchy, they risk the gulag if they upset the wrong people. Nobles have even more risk, given the possibility of bloodshed when they come into conflict. Regardless, for the capitalist the absolute worst case scenario is becoming a worker. Why should workers care? Walking over a metaphorical snake pit on a tightrope not impressive when the vast majority of the global population spend their entire lives in that pit. By your loose definition of tyranny, nature is a tyrant, forcing early human beings to toil and labor for centuries, with little in return other than a minimal sustenance? I define tyrant as someone with authority over other humans backed by violence, which is why to me the words criminal, and state are almost interchangeable. In capitalist hierarchies, participation is voluntary, making the word tyranny an inaccurate description. If one has the ability to sustain themselves without engaging in voluntary exchanges with other human beings, they are free to do so. Non-voluntary, or coerced exchanges are invalid, and are what define authoritarianism/totalitarianism. To me this means no human has the rights to the labor, or property of another without that humans content. >Political and economic hierarchy are an engine of chaos in society. Disagree, hierarchy creates predictable patterns in society that would otherwise be more chaotic. Not that chaos is a bad thing, but organizing into hierarchies is by definition not an 'engine for chaos'. >~~The~~ people ~~at the top~~ will inevitably break whatever rules a system has in any high reward / low risk situation. Everyone will, me, you, and everyone reading this included. >Expecting capitalists to follow the Non-Aggression Principle out of altruism in a situation where they can profit from violating it without being discovered is untenable. That's why most Ancaps advocate for a private/voluntary rights enforcement mechanisms for enforcing individual rights. >For their part, workers will always resent laboring to make others rich while they live with few meaningful options, and this will inevitably drive many of them outside the NAP due to desperation. Capitalism works in theory, just as state socialism does. Or more accurately, they both work under falsified theories. This assumes nobody enjoys their work, or professional accomplishments, or that nobody is entrepreneurial, or self employed. Granted, unskilled labor is rough, and doesn't pay much, but the further one ventures toward highly skilled in a desirable career, or entrepreneurial in nature the more ones labor enriches themselves. Personally, I can't say I enjoy my job enough to do it for free, but I've agreed to do it because of the compensation it provides making the agreement between us not only beneficial to my employer, it's beneficial to me as well. I'm free to choose my best option, and for now, I've decided this is it. >Capitalism without a state to enforce it is impossible because political power will shift from the governments to massive, land-owning corporations. These corps will effectively become states in their own right. Again, your definition of capitalism isn't the same as mine. People have been voluntarily exchanging goods and services since before there was a state. That's all I had time to respond to. &#x200B;",t3_a8j9ia,Anarchism

"r/communism has a weird ideology regarding 'imperialism.' Obviously we want the US to withdraw from foreign lands and give the people the opportunity to practice their own autonomy, particularly in Rojava. But that's not what's happening. The US is withdrawing on the heels of a massive weapons deal with Turkey and leaving the door open for a Turkish invasion. If the US withdrew troops with the guarantee that the Kurds would be protected from Turkish aggression, it'd be a completely different story. It's important that we be able to think—as communists in those subs are wont to remind us ad nauseum—to think about real material circumstances and not about abstractions like 'imperialism.' Right now there are two real alternatives—on the one hand, US troops remain in Syria and provide a buffer against Turkish aggression (by no means guaranteed, of course), or on the other, the US troops can withdraw and it's almost certain that Rojava will have to defend itself against Turkey. The so-called communists in those subs can't acknowledge that, however wrong the US military's occupation is, it pales in comparison to what Turkey will do. Ironically, they're the ones being idealistic. There was a right way for the US to withdraw and a wrong way; predictably, Trump chose the wrong way.

"Look I don't wanna be snarky or snappy here because I know everyone is learning at their own pace, so I will say earnestly, I think you possibly have a different understanding of anarchism than most people on this board. Yes, anarchism comes from a liberal European tradition. That doesn't mean it is aligned with liberalism today. It diverged significantly after 1848 when proletariat revolutionaries realized the liberal bourgeoisie would always be down to use them for a fight and then sell them out after. In 1871 you see the final break between the anarchist and communist traditions with classical liberalism, when the working class of Paris expelled the liberal business class and ran the city as a dictatorship of the proletariat (which is a Marxist idea but in this case also certainly anarchist. That split came later). Since then, anarchism developed globally as a tradition separate and distinct from liberalism, largely rejecting the idea of universal rights in favor of a materialist analysis of the state and capitalism. Indigenous and Black liberation movements around the world also inform anarchist theory. In 2018, it's pretty much impossible to reconcile 'classical liberalism' with the way that most people understand anarchism today. Here's an example. Liberals believe free speech is some kind of 'right' that is enshrined in a constitutional document, that applies equally to all people because the state (supposedly) enforces it. Anarchists, being materialists and realists, know free speech is the condition of being able to speak and to have your voice matter, regardless of what your so-called 'liberal rights' actually are. So an anarchist analysis of speech in American society would reveal this: due to the overwhelming control of most people's lives by the dictatorship of the workplace, the privatization or government control of all land, and the destruction of communities and local autonomy, most people have almost ability to speak and be heard. They have the 'right' to free speech, but this means nothing since materially, they are unable to do anything with it. It's not that anarchists even have to disagree with the idea that this 'right' exists somewhere out in the aether-- it's just that they **don't really care**, since they are interested in actual human liberation and not symbolism.

"TL;DR for those who don't have time to read my 'summary' either: Bon donates to Dr Bones patreon. He calls them and they become friends. He makes himself invaluable to them. They meet, get very drunk and have sex. He admits to being attracted to them for a long time. He behaves strangely, is manipulative, constantly pushing them for pics/meetings/etc and eventually comes clean with being a serial cheater after getting found out by his wife. Bon who already was alarmed by his behaviour decides to go public with their story when they find out that he was having relationship with several others, and they are afraid that these are just as manipulative or worse. Longer summary here: I'll try and make a quick summary from the twitter thread for those who don't want/can't read it all. For those who are arguing semantics over their use of the word 'grooming' in this context of everyone involved being adults, they give this definition as context: '(For those not up to date on terms relating to abusive relationships, grooming is a form of conditioning used to gain a person’s trust through a perceived emotional connection. This theme would happen throughout our “relationship.”) Anyway: Bon is an aspiring anarchist writer and a fan of Dr. Bones. They donate to his patreon, which establishes contact between them. They become close online friends. He praises their writing and helps them get published on different radical websites and such. My interpretation of the published conversations before they met for the first time: He shit-talked other radical people he didn't like. He told Bon they were great, but also tried to paint himself as the best way for them to get recognized in radical circles, and that several other radical actually were assholes who only gave them time of day because of Bones. Apart from this, they talked about most things, confiding in each other. It seems pretty clear to me that he liked Bon a lot (as you tend to do with your friends), but with hindsight and coupled with the fact that he kept insinuating that he was the key for them to succeed, it stinks of trying to make someone dependent of you. He also admitted to being very physically attracted to them before they ever met. Anyway, when they met, because Bon were in Florida, the plan (from Bon's side at least): was to talk anarchy and have a place to crash. Bones lived with his wife and mother-in-law, so Bon assuming that this would only be a platonic visit seems very reasonable. What happened instead was that they got extremely drunk, and Bon's version is that he was pushing them to drink from the first moment that they arrived at the house. The story also indicates that he was driving drunk to pick up his wife from work and buy more booze. Anyway, when everyone else had gone to sleep, they kept drinking and eventually had sex. Bon do not remember much of how this came to be, but doesn't call themselves a victim even though it's fairly obvious (to me at least) that Bones intentionally pushed them into drinking to lower their inhibitions. Afterwards, Bon is ashamed and tries to rationalize what they just did as them being infatuated with Bones since day 1. Bones on the other hand, now gets overtly sexual and open with that he has been attracted to them sexually for a long time and that he wants to have sex with them again. Over the months, Bon gets more and more discomforted by Bones increasingly reckless and horny behaviour. Things included are: * Bones stating several times in different graphic manners how he wants to have sex with them. Nothing wrong with that in itself, and it could be cut out for convenience, but Bon never seems to reply with the same kind of 'sexting'. * Bones' deleting conversations and having a sneaky behaviour because his wife is suspicious of him (note: they are in a mono-relationship. Bones is constantly breaking his wife's trust). He claims he will try to make her become open to polyamory. Nothing in the story indicates he actually tried this. * Bones suddenly gone missing, making his wife (and Bon) very worried. When he eventually resurfaces, he tells a strange tale of a destitute sex worker he met, and for some reason brags about not sleeping with her even though he could have, like this makes him some kind of hero. * Bones claiming that his wife tricked him into marrying her, and resenting her and her mother because of her mother's mental illness. * Bones repeatedly asking for nudes, sexual favors, for Bon to come see him and finally, for Bon to find him a trans sex worker to pay. This is extremely manipulative behaviour: he is trying to make them complicit in his repeated cheating, even when they are not the one he is cheating with. This is also a nasty thing to ask for in another way: Because Bon is a trans sex worker, he assumes that they know (and can give access to) other trans sex workers even though they do not live in the same state. For those who don't understand why this leaves a bad taste: imagine if you are, let's say, a black sex worker living in London, and your German friend asks you to get him a black sex worker in Berlin. In the end, Bon is planning for another visit to Florida, and wants to meet Bones to tell him in person that this is over, that he is making them extremely uncomfortable and that they don't want this. They don't write this openly (of course, because why would Bones consent to such a meeting?). On his side Bones is adamant that they come see him so that they can have sex, and even when several travel mishaps makes this hard, he still tries to find ways for them to meet for the specific purpose of sex. Even after his wife finds out that he's 'flirting' with *several people* online and throws him out of the house, his focus in their conversation is still on them having sex. He is completely unapologetic at first. Then, when Bon has seen his 'oh fuck' tweet and he comes clean about what happened and how he has now blocked them on twitter and wants to make amends (to his wife, presumably), they notice that he writes 'people', as in that he was having several affairs all along. Bon wasn't special. He didn't love them (as he claimed). They were just one of many persons that he talked to. Because of the manipulative dimension of their relationship, Bon decides to make the whole thing public, since they are afraid that these other people are likewise being manipulated/groomed/lied to by Bones. Oh, and some of the shit they claim he has said and done is being corroborated by others on twitter. ",t3_a8v0mq,Anarchism

"I think maybe the same is happening in Europe. I don't have sources at hand, but if memory serves Germany is (semi-secretly) paying Erdoğan 400 euros per head to keep Syrian and other refugees in camps in Turkey so they don't cause political chaos in the EU. Afaik the money goes to the refugees, but then they are kept in large concentration camps in Southern Turkey (which I saw with my own eyes only a few months ago) so in effect it goes to Erdoğan's dictatorship (since they have nowhere else to spend it other than in prison stores). 5 star concentration camps, as far as gulags go, but basically prisons they are hostage in for as long as this scheme runs. Of course this is a growth industry, since it amounts to a 'democracy' funnelling money to a dictatorship. Erdoğan is constructing more and more of them. He's basically getting into the privatized jails business. And so he has means and incentive to fill them. (*Okay, here's your choice: POW and we torture you, or you can call yourself a 'refugee' and then you get money from the EU*). I think you have to read The 45's wall in the same light as China's.

"I don't want to come off as someone who is saying that this isn't a big deal, because it's a *huge* deal, but I don't think this is necessarily the end of the DFNS. If Turkey invades there is going to be a lot of death, pain, and suffering, but I don't think Turkey is guaranteed a victory. It took a combined force of Turkish soldiers and TFSA a month and a half to take Afrin, which was a region that was isolated from the rest of Rojava while the SDF was fighting a two front war. Though they have managed to hold the area, they are still fighting a brutal battle against SDF guerrillas that are killing dozens of occupiers a week. Turkey clearly has the advantage going forward, but they'll be charging into the SDFs home turf and the SDF is no longer fighting a two front war, not to mention the Turkish won't have support of the TFSA going forward after they started offing them a few weeks back. A lot of Turkish troops are going to die, and that has the potential to turn public opinion quick. If the Turkish military doesn't perform at 100% for the entire operation, the DFNS could easily turn into their Afghanistan. They've been fighting the PKK for decades to no avail, to think that they'll simply run right over Rojava is potentially a bit naive on the part of Turkish strategists. The single biggest advantage the Turkish military has going forward is air power. If the SDF are able to negotiate with the SAA or the French to enforce a no fly zone over the DFNS, Turkey will not be able to win, period. Even if they are not able to secure such an agreement, it's important to remember that the SDF is a uniformed military made up of fighters who come from a lineage of guerrilla warfare. They might lose a conventional war, but their main strength is in their ability to fight asymmentrically, as they have been for decades, and will likely continue to do so for decades to come if need be. Even if Turkey wins on the conventional battlefield, the spirit of socialism will live on in the region. The PKK and the YPG/J are socialist at heart, and that's not likely to change with a defeat, they'll just go underground until their next chance to come around. At least that's my take on the situation as of right now. ",t3_a7xrdt,Anarchism

However, globalized markets without the free movement of people is just a way to oppress people internationally. People who do not make this distinction are being disingenuous with their philosophy. For example poor people in places like Bangladesh do not benefit from globalist economics, but if we had a globalist society where the underpaid sweatshop workers could easily move to a nation with higher wages and employee protections it would be a huge benefit. The issue with globalism is that most of it's proponents care much more about the free global movement of capital than they do about the free global movement of human beings.",t3_a5wnfa,Anarchism

Slurs institute an oppressive hierarchy by their very nature because they are a reminder, to the person who is the target of the slur, that they used to be demeaned and dehumanized. We must be against that, otherwise why the fuck are we even here? 'Nigger' was a term used to dehumanize people of color. It is not okay to use the term (outside of very specific academic uses). People of color can use it because the term is *about them*. They are *reclaiming it*. Same for 'faggot', 'tranny', 'slut', etc. These are all terms that have been used in the past to institute an oppressive hierarchy over gay people, trans people, and women who are sexually liberated, respectively As much as I despise LSC, they link to a  about all this stuff.

"Running as a medic in Cville was an enormously traumatizing and radicalizing experience for me. I spent the following year with nothing but good feelings about Fields being locked up and facing the fire, even if I don't agree with the system. Now that the verdict came down, I feel nothing but a deep sadness. To put it bluntly, fuck James Fields and what he did, but also absolutely no justice has been served and this does nothing to mediate what happened. Story time: The morning of Cville before shit really popped off, I ran to my car to get some more gear with a crew of like five or six people. Some awkward dude wearing IE gear waddled passed and awkwardly waved at me. Not like a 'I'm a bad ass Fash, I'm so not scared of you I'm gonna wave at you and tell you I'll be seeing you later' but like this weird genuine, super awkward wave. They waved, lowered their head to the ground and kept walking. At no point did I feel threatened or even angered, just kind of in awe at how fucking awkward this person was. I almost felt bad for them. Three months later, in the middle of a group therapy session I connected the dots and realized that the person was James Fields. I don't know anything about Fields, but experiencing that, and then seeing footage with him in it through out the day and seeing that, while he was rolling with IE, he didn't really have any battle buddies and seemed to be pretty on his own in a crowd of people, and I just feel sad. This is a dude who probably had some serious shit to work through, probably had no real close relationships, and likely got radicalized on some shit board on 4chan or something and joined a group hoping for companionship. He was on his own all day, and to prove his allegiance to his cause committed an act of cowardly martyrdom to impress a bunch of people who didn't care for him. He's now going to spend the rest of his life locked up and further radicalizing. If he's in gen-pop he's gonna fall in with the white gangs, if he's segregated he's going to succumb to the mental torture and blame this on the people who came out on August 12th to fight him and his. He will never be rehabilitated, he will never fully come to terms with the reality of what he did, and his punishment will never mend the broken bodies and souls of that day. It just all seems like a waste. To be clear, I'm not saying that he should just be let free and we all should forget about what happened. To be honest I don't know what should be done. All I know is that the verdict, at least in me, has brought more frustration than closure. I really hope this helps Heather's parents sleep a little happier at night, at least that would be a plus. But for me this was like ripping off a bandage that had molded to scab. All the shit I thought I had dealt with and locked away is back, but from a completely different angle; one which I don't have the slightest clue how to even begin addressing.

This is especially likely when they're from privileged class / race / gender positions and somehow feel cucked vis a vis life goals. They are susceptible to out group animosity, express it in a rage modeled by a militant culture, and so they grab the tools of violence within arms reach to express that rage. Unfortunately, in the US, many many guns are within arms reach. From this standpoint, libs may be right that the guns amplify the death count in mass killings, but the anarchist recognizes that the root of the problem is capitalism / fascism / hierarchy, etc. Serious gun control measures may save significant numbers of lives, but the anarchist has to weigh that against the potential lives lost when disarmed communities cannot defend themselves against capital and its agents.

"From the first paragraph of the article: >Identity Politicians (IPs) are a particular kind of leftist who use the spectre[1] of an identity-category (gender, race, sexuality, etc) as a lever to obtain power. In the sense discussed here, they should not be considered coterminous either with groups of people oppressed by identity categories, or even that subset who prioritise identity as a key site of struggle. Not all women, Black people, People of Colour (POC)[2], or members of other specifiable groups are IPs; not all feminists, anti-racists, or even separatists are IPs. Racism, sexism and other oppressions along identity axes are sociologically real, and not every person involved in the struggle against such oppressions is an IP. Not much further down, the author address intersectionality: >Intersectionality - the recognition of multiple forms or axes of oppression, with complex interacting effects - is an effective theoretical response to the problems of Identity Politics, but there have clearly been difficulties putting it into practice. In identity-linked movements, some people use intersectionality as a way to avoid the idea of principal contradiction, although occasionally in practice, people who claim to be intersectional end up treating one or two oppressions as primary. This is how the author defines identity politics: >What is being criticised here is a particular political style, rather than a theoretical orientation - a style which labels as oppressive any deviation from a particular political line, which resorts almost immediately to public denunciation and exclusion, and which entails analytical and categorical rigidity, with corresponding boundary-policing. They can be distinguished from those whose approaches pursue open-ended becomings through the deconstruction of identity-categories (eg Heckert), which are minoritarian becomings rather than minority identities. >IPs see one axis of oppression as primary - the principal contradiction[3] They demand that everyone focus on this axis. If someone fails to do so, IPs label them racist, sexist, white supremacist, patriarchal, etc. Ditto if they refuse leadership by the oppressed group (often meaning the IPs themselves), deviate from the IP’s proposed political line, or criticise an IP.

"It's seen as a two way street by one party, the hunters. I doubt the animal being killed feels overwhelmed by a warm, comforting sense of being respected. It was also customary for husbands in Western culture to treat their wives with respect, which could encompass physical abuse, rape, belittlement, chastisement, etc. in addition to genuine respect. &#x200B; Believing that you're respecting another by following a code of ethics (which happens to bestow all the power on you) and actually respecting their interests and motivations aren't the same thing. We invented these notions of 'respect' to organize our societies. We can appreciate them from a cultural or historical perspective while also acknowledging where they fall short philosophically or morally when deciding whether or not to continue them. &#x200B; I assume that when we're talking about the end of eating meat we're talking about an industrial society where sources of plant-based protein, nutrients, and vitamins are plentiful, not a historical scenario or a remote tribe or an impoverished country where meat is the staple.",t3_a29xff,Anarchism

"Is there any vision to anarchism beyond the transitional stage of smashing and burning everything? It appears to me, and I would guess many others that anarchists are purely thrill seekers using political ideologies as an excuse to riot. It seems to me that beyond the chaos of rioting, even if enough people became anarchists to cause the coveted “revolution,” people will eventually seek stability of some sort again. Humans are curious creatures and we will continue to seek innovation and that manifests itself in technology, space travel, deep sea exploration and all other frontiers of understanding that anarchists seem to despise. Any way you cut it, rioting is not a stable state. Families are not going to be interested in maintaining states of civil unrest for extended periods of time and eventually societal structures will need to be formed in order for the 7+ billion of us to function. So it’s frustrating to listen to angst, and rage filled young men quoting all sorts of ideological figures and philosophers while calling for riots and destruction without considering where civilization has come from. We came from a sort of anarchy to get to here. No matter how many times you smash it all to bits, this is where we’ll end up. It’s inevitable because people need something to do. Progress in various fields is what gives human beings lives purpose. To smash everything because it’s not working perfect for everyone is insanity. The real heroes and leaders of our time are the people quietly trying to solve the worlds many problems.

"It reminds me of that moral conundrum that sometimes gets brought up in introductory philosophy of ethics classes. It goes a little something like this: A man who absolutely abhors war and nuclear proliferation and has promised himself, on principle, to never work to create those things, finds himself in the unenviable position of being offered a job working on creating better nukes. Further, he knows that the other person being interviewed for the job *really fucking loves nukes* and that she would passionately pursue the job, likely leading to more advances in nuclear research. Instead, if he takes the job, he knows he's going to half ass it and do the bare minimum to not get fired, which will slow down the course of nuclear research. Should he take the job, violating his principles to never act to further nuclear research, in order to ensure that the much more enthusiastic employee doesn't get the job and, ultimately, slow down the research? Or is it wrong of him to violate his principles, because there is some moral importance to *him* being the one to do the research, *even if* he's doing it to slow down progress? I'm in the geospatial field, so every day I feel like that guy, and play that moral conundrum through my head. I do just enough to not get fired and to keep a roof over my and my boyfriend's head, but I *know* that, as an independent imagery provider, our imagery can be used by anyone. Sure, we help the forestry service stop deforestation, and we help provide imagery to aid disaster recovery after earthquakes and things, and we provide atmospheric data that helps us predict that kind of weather, which is all great stuff. But we also provide imagery to people in defense and oil gas, imagery which almost certainly has got some innocent, poor civilians in some country I've never been to killed. On the one hand, I know that if I don't do this job, someone else will, and that I've got to look out for myself and my boyfriend, and additionally that almost anyone could do the job better than I can, so I'm probably doing some good by gumming up the works a bit. But at the same time, the absolute dread I feel, every day, walking into an office full of happy people seemingly perfectly OK with the work they do leading to the deaths of innocent people... It's absolutely crushing. A part of me knows I'd be doing less bad in the world working as a Target bagger, but then I wouldn't have the time, energy, or money to engage in the kind of anarchist praxis I typically do in my day to day life, so I'd be doing less good as well.

"I would love it if people in the mainstream actually took people being killed (aka 'dying under mysterious circumstances') seriously for once. Like... -Journalists like Americans Michael Hastings and Serena Shim who were almost certainly murdered by intelligence agencies (the CIA and Turkish intelligence, respectively) and never investigated. -Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas (the lawyer who served the papers for the DNC fraud lawsuit to Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office), and Beranton Whisenant (a federal prosecutor from Wasserman Schultz's district who was found dead on a beach from blunt force trauma to the head). -Whistleblowers like Barry Jennings (Deputy Director of the Office of Emergency Management stationed in Building 7 of the WTC who claimed to have experienced massive explosions and then stepped over dead bodies during his rescue from Building 7, who then strangely recanted his story, and abruptly died shortly after. Another disturbing case, the so-called 'DC Madame: Deborah Jeane Palfrey. She ran the high-class escort service Pamela Martin and Associates in DC which was known for its discretion and allegedly patronized by important Washington politicians (ABC News posthumously used phone records to identify numerous clients, but only publicized the names of two State Department and DoD officials, but other names have been offered by people close to her). Prior to a court date, Palfrey stated publicly that she had highly damning information about some of her clients which she had learned through her exposure to them and that she intended to . She explicitly stated publicly that she would not kill herself, then she was found apparently hanged in the shed behind her mother's house. There are other examples of whistleblowers, other 9/11 witnesses whose stories didn't conform to the official narrative, and I'm sure I don't have to tell anyone about the many radicals, labor organizers, civil rights activists, etc., who the CIA, FBI, and police have murdered over the years. I will grant that I find some more certainly suspect than others (Beranton Whisenant and Deborah Palfrey are certainly very odd cases, but I don't know how Whisenant fits in-- whether he had any relevance to the DNC fraud lawsuit or if there was any other motive to be killed, although it seems apparent that he was murdered by SOMEONE-- and in Palfrey's case, there is a lot of reason to be suspicious, plenty of motive, and one of the girls who worked at her escort service was also found hanged under equally strange circumstances, but in her case she was facing a 6-8 year prison sentence. Now, certainly that can be given as an explanation. It's really not that life-ending a sentence for a woman her age, she didn't seem depressed, her friends and neighbors claim it doesn't make any sense, she explicitly said she would not kill herself over this, would've had book deals and such, but you never know-- maybe she had a serious change of heart). But my point with these examples is that, time after time, journalists, whistleblowers-- people who put their lives on the line in true public service-- are made to disappear, and the world just keeps on turning. Perhaps because of the uncomfortable implications, perhaps because we don't want to be discredited as 'conspiracy theorists,' or perhaps because we're just wrapped up in our own lives and focusing our activism on other issues, but we don't linger on these crimes, we don't sufficiently demand justice for these people... The perpetrators just get away with it and they become footnotes of history that we rarely even think about. But I implore everyone to think about the consequences of allowing this to become a world in which dissidents, threats to power, people who try to reveal the crimes of the ruling class, can just be eliminated with impunity. I think that, if it means creating obstruction to the ability of the state (and other powerful social forces) to simply murder at will, as long as they're sneaky about it, it's a more-than-worthy cause to bring attention to. I am perfectly empathetic to those who approach any such case with skepticism, who require motive and evidence, to take it seriously... But in many cases motive, evidence, and suspects all exist, and those who broach the subject are declared to be insane conspiracy theorists anyway. There is absolutely sufficient cause for the rationally and empirically-minded to investigate many of these subjects, rather than to just dismiss them and to be complicit in the corporate media's smear-campaigns. There is quite a big difference, in my view, between David Icke baselessly saying that the world is run by reptilians in human suits, or QAnon claiming that Trump has actually been secretly convicting Democrats and celebrities and sending them to Guantanamo Bay, but making them pretend they're free day-to-day so we don't know, versus someone who raises reasonable questions like 'If Seth Rich died in a robbery, why was his wallet, phone, watch, and all other valuables left on his body,' or 'Why would Assad justify American intervention by attacking his own civilians with chemical weapons when he was literally within a hair's breadth of winning the war against the Islamist militias by conventional means,' or 'Why was lots of a very high tech nanothermitic explosive found in the dust from the World Trade Center?' Hell, there's even a difference between someone who claims John Podesta and Hillary Clinton run a satanic child sex trafficking ring out of a pizza shop and someone who asks 'Why are the Clintons, Alan Dershowitz, Donald Trump, and so many others all on Jeffrey Epstein's 'Lolita Express' flight logs to his private island where he's known to have exploited minors for sex? There is always a difference between having an irrationally conspiratorial worldview and really analyzing and thinking critically about the possibility of conspiracies occurring on the basis of legitimate empirical data. Absolutely, structural analysis is essential. Absolutely we need to understand the very real role institutional imperatives have in shaping people's actions, to understand the social relations that different forms of organization are built on and what those social relations mean for the members of those institutions. You 100% cannot make sense or capitalism without these kinds of systemic modes of analysis. But sometimes I hear fellow leftists argue that we should use that kind of lens *instead of* understanding people to be individual agents who make decisions and have personal motives. I think it's self-evident that these things are not mutually exclusive. You and I are individual agents who make decisions (whether or not that free will is illusory), and we are also parts of institutions. Institutional imperatives and social relations are a factor, but so are our thoughts and decisions, and sometimes we conspire or organize, whether it's in pursuit of collective goals or personal ones.",t3_a1tw7t,Anarchism

". Here is a quick and rough translation by yours truly who thought it would be of interest, with some help from DeepL. Please excuse the errors (such as in the title ¬_¬) and weird language, it is getting late. # Gilets jaunes: what their very first study tells about the revolt December 11, 2018 Chloé Leprince Through 166 evaluated questionnaires, the first field study of the *gilets jaunes* tells who they are, from what position they are talking and what it is they want, they for whom it is their first participation in a social movement. Here is a summary of the main results from the study. The *gilets jaunes*' past month of mobilization has contributed to bringing class back into the middle of public debate. The movement has however also had the effect of making two distinct categories of people more heard than prior: - People of, one could say, 'modest' means that are in fact either from the working class or at the poorer end of the middle class, who have long been invisible in both the media and political debate and now suddenly regain in visibility. - Sociologists and social science researchers in general, who have been numerous in coming up with contributions aiming at shedding light on a movement that surprised many with its vigor, but also with a novelty that had to be deciphered - and it had been a long while since the media fed that much off social science, often aided by the viral potential of social networks. After four days of mobilization, the first field study on the *gilets jaunes* was published this Monday, December 10, through an article in *Le Monde* - or at least, its first conclusions since its authoring collective of more than 60 researchers in sociology, political science and geography has announced it intends to keep the study going. Their intentions are to better define the profile of those we have gotten used to naming, in their own words, 'the yellow vests', and to analyze as finely as possible the way they mobilize, especially as the movement has the pecularity of having emerged in a manner that was simultaneously broad, fast, and outside of all organized structures such as parties and unions. ## Questionnaires, yet true encounters This first report on the work of the collective of researchers (mostly federated around Sciences-Po Bordeaux, the INRA and the CNRS) harks mostly on a study conducted by thirteen of them through the use of questionnaires. Note however that 'questionnaire' does not signify 'write-in form': to obtain 'richer' answers and 'longer' testimonies, researchers put these together from live, face-to-face interviews obtained by meeting the *gilets jaunes* where they were mobilizing - essentially 'in traffic circles' and in the street during their demonstrations. Of the twenty-eight questions asked to all interviewed, five were so-called 'open questions', but even so-called 'closed' questions (theoretically calling for short answers), the interrogated have occasionally given answers that were more detailed than anticipated. 'Concerning the subjects touched, 15 questions were about the participants' motivations, the reforms they desired, their preferred modes of action and their attitude towards the political; the last 13 dealt with the sociodemographic profile of the demonstrators', the researchers add. All in all, 166 questionnaires were analyzed between November 24 and the publication of the results on December 10. These questionnaires were handed out during the second and third days of the *gilets jaunes*' mobilization, sometimes called 'Act II' and 'Act III' (November 24 and December 1), in six geographic zones: - Bordeaux and surroundings - Marseille - Caen and surroundings - Rennes - Montpellier - Grenoble and surroundings 'For this study, we decided to concentrate on persons active in the movement who participated in at least demonstration or blockade', the collective adds. What emerges from these questionnaires far from invalidates the first outline for an analysis that was formulated during the very first day of mobilization on November 17. Field work makes it even clearer instead. Back then, many a researcher that attempted to analyze this peculiar movement underlined the necessity to take time for a proper analysis, as well as to listen to what the interrogated had to say (and the way in which they would). A hundred and sixty-six questionnaires and three weeks laters, the collective of thirteen researchers publishes not the composite picture of the 'archetypal *gilet jaune*', but rather an X-ray of the collectives of which they could observe the mobilization in the six zones that they researched. These are the main lessons they have learned: ## Who they are These *gilets jaunes* are on average 45 years old, with a mobilization that is substantially equivalent in the age ranges from 35 to 49 and from 50 to 64. A large majority of them work, and when they are senior citizens, they are retirees who have worked in the past. 55% of the 166 *gilets jaunes* met via questionnaire are men and 45% women, but this female ratio is much larger than the historical participation of working-class women in such movements. The researchers underline that the absence of established leaders has brought women to a broader and unprecedented prominence within a heterogeneous movement. Among \[the *gilets jaunes*\], white-collar workers are overrepresented: 33% in total if one takes retirees into account, but 45% if not - even though white-collar workers make up only 27% of the broader French working population. Other overrepresented category within the mobilized *gilets jaunes*: craftsmen, shopkeepers and business owners - 14% of the working people questioned for only 6.6% of the entire French working population (and it is all the more interesting that they had not been pillars of social protest until then). Conversely, blue-collar workers represent no more than 14% of the 166 *gilets jaunes* interrogated via this questionnaire even though they represent one out of five workers in France (and even one out of three if only men are taken into account). Executives are in turn half as numerous in the traffic circles and demonstration than they are within French society as a whole (13% of the interrogated workers vs. 26% of the working population in general). 'Non-workers' (the unemployed and retirees) make up a quarter of the mobilized people who answered the questionnaire. ## What they think For half of them (47%), this mobilization within the fold of the 'gilet jaunes' is a first: if four out of five had already been in a demonstration, only 44% had previously been in a strike. A third affirm, by the way, being 'neither right- nor left-wing'. Of the others, only 6% define themselves as centrists, 12% right-wing, 42% left-wing and 15% far-left. The 166 gathered questionnaires within six different corners of France bring an answer supported by numbers as to whether the *Rassemblement National* managed to co-opt the movement: on November 24 and December 1st, only 5% of those interrogated see themselves as far-right, which concurs with the first observations that Benoît Coquard could make in other traffic circles from other rural areas during the very first day of mobilization on November 17. This also concurs with the deciphering attempt of four researchers from the LERASS, in Toulouse, who had combed through the Facebook posts of numerous *gilets jaunes* and shown that only very little xenophobic discourse could be found in them. ## What they want The first motive for their mobilization mentioned by those interrogated is purchasing power. Calamitous end of months and the idea of being unable to 'afford indulging in anything' have been largely echoed in the testimonies gathered by the questionnaires. Half of those come from people not subject to tax with a medium income below 30% of France's average. It is however not possible to affirm that the *gilets jaunes* are a movement of the poorest: within the gathered questionnaires, only 10% have an income below 800€ per month. Sixty-nine of the 166 people who answered also hinted at the heavy burden from taxes, but one out of three aggressively brings forward what they see as disdain for the working class (*mépris de classe*) about which the interrogated talk in terms of 'arrogance' or 'privileges'. 'May the government put itself in our shoes', say several demonstrators. This field work echoes the notion of a 'moral economy' of historian E.P. Thomson, which politologist Samuel Hayat brought forward in a blog post: almost everywhere in France, it is finally about social justice that the mobilized *gilets jaunes* talked to the investigators who submitted them their questionnaire. They are not fundamentally hostile to the idea of taxes per se, but figure that these taxes are distributed terribly unevenly. Among the gathered testimonies, one out of five demands a better distribution of wealth. ",t3_a5bkc9,Anarchism

"The historical examples in this thread are good but I'm going to comment from the perspective of my understanding of contemporary, 21st century anarchists and Marxist-Leninists. I'm often unimpressed by anarchist critiques of Marxism-Leninism since they usually betray a very shallow understanding of what MLism actually is, as a theory and a practice, and they often boil down to two things: One, the 'will to power' argument, which says that some humans innately lust after power and control and that party systems for achieving communism preserve hierarchies, so certain people who are corrupt end up taking power after a revolution and recreating the inequities of capitalism. This argument should be dismissed since it is based on a flawed notion of human nature. That's a whole other debate but basically it's the same thing that American liberals will say for why any type of leftism can't work. The second argument that you often hear goes, 'well just look at all the people who died under Marxism-Leninism'. This, again, probably has some truth to it, but it alone is not an argument for why a specific theory is inadequate. It's not possible to parse apart the historical circumstances of the time, much less to figure out which statistics about, e.g. deaths in the Soviet Union are verifiable and which are American propaganda. In order to make a real anarchist critique of Marxism-Leninism, we first need to accurately describe what we mean by these ideas. Both marxism-leninism and the social, non-nihilist types of anarchism imagine the same end: communism, a stateless, classless society, free of exploitation in human relations. It's difficult to compare, e.g., an anarchist text written in 2015 with Marx, or a modern Marxist-Leninist party with Daddy Kropotkin, but I think we can generally say that this final aim is the goal of both theoretical frameworks. These frameworks differ in their approaches for achieving this end state. I will attempt to go through some of the ways that these theoretical approaches differ, and posit my argument for why I am ultimately an anarchist and not a Marxist-Leninist. **The State**: For Marxist-Leninists, the modern state is an implement of class dictatorship. Lenin saw all the states of early 20th century Europe as dictatorships of the bourgeoisie, where state power was used to crush working people and defend and advance the interests of the capitalist class. Therefore, communism could be achieved by taking control of the apparatus of the state, and using it to crush class enemies. Lenin argued that only state power in the hands of the proletariat was capable of defeating the bourgeoisie, and that the state would 'naturally' wither away after the bourgeoisie were ultimately defeated. For anarchists, the state itself is a relation of bourgeois domination that must be dispersed and destroyed. It is incorrect to suggest that state power is a neutral implement to be wielded by whoever can control it. The modern 19th/20th/21st century 'state' is not something that has always existed, but rather, it is a historical formation of class power specific to the bourgeoisie that came into existence for the express purpose of maintaining relationships of domination necessary for global capitalism, and by extension, imperialism. Therefore, if it is 'seized', it can certainly be used to crush the power of the people who formerly controlled it, but as long as it structures human relationships in society, it will not be possible to transform society into one that does not function through relations of domination and submission. I think it has yet to be seen whether a Marxist-Leninist state would actually 'wither away' following the final defeat of the capitalist class, since no historically ML state has ever reached that power. But I think it's highly unlikely, because the state itself is not a neutral tool, but rather a self-perpetuating formation that is constitutive of class domination. **Organization** Marxist-Leninists advocate the creation of a mass revolutionary party, in order to build political power outside of bourgeois governments and to ultimately confront and defeat the capitalist state. They argue that a 'vanguard' of politically conscious proletarians is necessary to begin the struggle, to educate the rest of the workers, and to ultimately seize power and take over the state. MLs argue that without the consistency of democratic centralism, in which minority opinions must submit to the plan of the majority, struggles will fail. Anarchists have for a long time insisted on creating the conditions of the envisioned society within their own organizational principles, meaning that they have tried to limit where possible the hierarchical organizations of parties and vanguards. Instead, many anarchists argue for a horizontal structure, where decision making is distributed across many decentralized actors and decisions are based on consensus as much as possible. This is for two reasons: 1). Anarchists have long contended that the hierarchical structure of ML parties is extremely vulnerable to attack and subversion by enemies, who can destroy whole movements by simply chopping off the head. In extreme cases, the hierarchy of a party conducting militant actions means that enemies can capture a small number of party members and turn them against the rest, through torture or bribery, and thereby corrupt and sell out the entire institution. The infiltration of the Black Panthers and many other leftist movements in the 60s and 70s happened this way. A horizontal structure, or even a cell structure, is much more resilient to this kind of infiltration, since it is impossible to destroy the movement just by attacking a few key nodes. In less extreme cases, hierarchical organizations are also just more likely to fall apart if by chance a leader makes a series of bad decisions, or drops out. 2.) Anarchists have also pointed out that when ML parties gain power within a state, the material interests of the party immediately start to diverge from the material interests of the class of people that the party is meant to protect. From Lenin and Mao to the union bureaucracies of the American labor movement, 'labor leaders' tend to prioritize the 'partial gains' of the party or bureaucracy over the need for militant struggle. From the point of view of the party bureaucracy, it is always better to maintain their position rather than risk losing it all by escalating conflict. This means that both the USSR and the union movement in the US and Europe, labor leaders almost immediately started acting to control and contain the militancy of the rank-and-file workers, fearing that further conflict would be too risky. This has the effect of chilling and dampening any genuine mass movement. **A few other things** One further critique of Marxism in general that I would posit is the insistence on the primacy of the worker. 'Workerism' refers to the way that this heavy-handed insistence on the centrality of the working-class for politics goes beyond simply describing the conditions of the exploited people of the world, and starts prescribing and insisting upon their status as workers and nothing more. In the course of attempting to liberate workers, MLs end up reinscribing and valorizing the status of the worker even more. In contrast, if we want to liberate workers, we should try to liberate them as people first, deserving of dignity regardless of the work they do. We should also liberate people who do not work-- the mentally ill, the homeless, the unemployed, and all sorts of other people. I'm not saying that Marxist-Leninists can't also be conscious of this critique and work around it, but just that anarchists and the anti-work Left have been pointing this out for a long time. In short, anarchism is more satisfying to me as a theory but out there in the real world we have about 15 years until we suffer mass irreversible climate ecocide so you better get off the internet and start working together with people on projects to actually start changing things. MLs are comrades if they are decent people who treat their fellow humans with dignity and respect.",t3_a76th7,Anarchism

"French here. Cops are, in theory, subjected to the same self-defence standards as the rest of the populations, and only have the right to shoot to kill in a self-defense situation (threat on their life), but with means proportionate to the threat. Protesters throwing stones are not gonna get shot with bullets, but are going to be managed by less lethal means (that can still maim). Also, they may seem in danger in this videos, but very few people are actually in favour of killing cops, during the Paris protests, isolated cops got escorted out of the crowd, but they weren't lynched, protesters mostly want to go were they want, and stay were they want, not to attack cops. There is also the fact that the level of violence is pretty low in France. Sure, there may be impressive riots with barricades, burned cars and lootings, but very few people actually wish to hurt anyone, this is not like rioters in Paris are there to kill the local bourgeoisie, they 'just' want to burn their car. In addition, police starting to shoot to kill on protesters would risk sparking a huge revolt, with massive loss of life, and may precipitate the situation out of control, I doubt the government wants that. And finally, the French are way less armed than the yanks. Handguns are not carried by civilians, as this requires a valid reason, and an extensive permitting process, and there are quite few handguns in France. These are the kind of weapons that make people die in interactions with police, since cops are scared shitless of a concealed handgun. Someone on the street pulling a pistol on you is not gonna happen in France, so the 'threat level' is lower, and police training is less about learning how to shoot someone who twitches, and more about beating up anyone who looks at them funny.

People will make their own states if there are none, so it's better to have a small one, bound by a solid constitution, that basically enforces a few federal laws. My ideal world would be where everybody is an intelligent, rational person where we all get along well enough to not kill eachother, but that's unrealistic, so my more realistic ideal world would have a few federal laws just to ensure that things don't inevitably devolve I to a conplete shitfest.

"This time of year can be especially rough since capitalism has instilled this false belief within society that success is being able to drop a grand on Christmas presents for your family and if you're celebrating the holidays alone then you've somehow failed society. It's no-fkn-wonder so many people kills themselves this time of year. Stay strong comrade, sometimes the grind gets to be too much and I've definitely told my fair share of companies to go fuck themselves without a back up plan. YOUR WORTH IS NOT MEASURED BY YOUR PRODUCTION. So reconnect with friend/family you might have been too busy to see because of work. Apply for jobs in non-profit or other sectors that you might find more fruitful and less of a grind. Read, play videos, make music or do whatever it is that you like to escape into. Catch up on sleep. Me personally, I play guitar and sing in bands and my music has always been a constructive outlet for my rage at the absurdity of the system we live under. Aside from that I've been involved in DSA and will start going to IWW meetings in my city.

Personally, I believe anarchism as the predominate mode of social organization is 100-200 years off. I believe our situation is so desperate right now. There is so much work to be done. But the work is simple. Win victories. Hold. Weather the counter attack. Hold. Win victories. Hold. Etc. For the next 100-200 years. And people will have to die. Trillions of dollars are at stake.

The stakes are mounting by the day, and the inevitable is clear. There will be violence, and whether we must prepare ourselves to commit violence is, in my view, secondary to the REAL concern which is how much are we willing to sacrifice.

"  Greek Police are bracing for expected riots on Thursday, the tenth anniversary of the killing of teenager Alexandros Grigoropoulos by a police officer. The young man was killed during a demonstration in Exarchia, in central Athens.  Five thousand police officers, including riot police and officers in plain clothes, will be employed in hopes of preventing the violent clashes that have taken place on December 6 of every year since 2008.  Police are also concerned that December 6 will become a symbolic day for attacks against police stations. There have been several such attacks in recent months, and authorities expect more on Thursday in “retaliation” for the murder of Grigoropoulos. There will be additional security measures to prevent such attacks, with all Hellenic Police agencies on high alert. There is also fear that anarchist groups may launch police station attacks on the eve of the Grigoropoulos anniversary as a precursor to the expected Thursday demonstrations. Police helicopters will be flying over the center of Athens during the day of December 6 to monitor any suspicious activity. On Thursday there will also be a scheduled demonstration organized by political parties of the Left and allied political groups.  ",t3_a3pbkp,Anarchism

Indeed, when the government tries to nominate leaders to pacify the protest, it just doesn't work, and now some yellow proles are humiliating ministers on TV!

"IMO it's because the protest is messy. Its social and political composition is all over the place, and the mainstream discourse has tried very very very hard to make it look like a bunch of angry petit-bourgeois who want to pollute more, with an infiltration of far-right and neo-nazi groups. Opportunists on the right are trying hard to coopt it, but its not working all that well. The french left took a while to support it for these reasons. Especially the 'traditional' left institutions and social circles in Paris, who bought into that mainstream narrative, and saw the protests as reactionary. The situation has shifted dramatically over the past few weeks tho. The movement is structuring itself and published a series of demands that make total sense when looked through the lenses of class warfare: they want less taxes on the poor, more taxes on the rich, they want heavy taxes on kerosene and fuel used for transportation of goods / luxury modes of transportation (which pollute way more), they want a 'social' environmental transition (read, they want environmental policy that actually attack what pollutes, and who pollutes the most, ie: the bourgeoisie), they want more funding in social services. Unions are joining in, anarchists have joined in in Paris. Pretty sure some marxist groups are joining in as well (the NPA was in support from the beginning for example). So now, obviously a social movement made up of the working class is going to contain messy and reactionary elements, its going to contain some homophobes, some racists, some sexists, its going to contain people who aren't politicized and fall easily for conspiracy theories. That's a concern, a really big one, and it makes sense some comrades are cautious about it. But the working class protesting is also made up of racialized people, of women, etc, the working class is not homogenous. The biggest mistake for leftists would be to refuse to go in and provide guidance and political narratives and militancy, because if they don't, the movement can turn reactionary. And if they don't, the movement won't make the step towards revolutionary potential. But that potential is there ya. ",t3_a23z4t,Anarchism

If we all had our needs met then crime would significantly decrease. 2. Educated communities have proven to also have lower crime rates. So investing in education for all would reduce crime and poverty. 3. Sick people are more likely to not work and get on government assistance. So investing in healthcare for all would increase the employment rate which would strengthen the economy. Lowly educated or dumb people cant understand any of this because its not a direct result to them personally.

They were talking about police responses in general. Basically any instance where a police officer had to use some degree of force. For example if a police officer shot someone. Situation A: the police officer opened fire on an unarmed person. Situation B: the police officer shot someone as they were aiming a gun. These situations are very different and require context to make a judgement on. In situation B the officer would be justified in opening fire. In situation A they would not be justified in opening fire. That is an instance where context matters. That was all he was saying.

"How we get here from rojava the question if rojava is not socialist or not? Being a working class pal myself, and living among them, i can say to you from experience that most of them are ignorand, and evne if you say to them about socialism, they may like it, but when the discussion goes on about religion or nationality, they will certainly see you as a madman(how dare you not love our dear homeland and call it a creation of the rich?How dare you insult god?), so if you want to hear the truth, most people are stupit, indipendment from class. Capitalism, or rather opportunism, is in nature, as is the feeling of justice or revenge or the feeling to murder e.t.c e.t.c. What i want to say is, that the left, is beyond the human nature. Because it is in nature does not mean that is good. This is why people of the right, relegious or nationalist, or capitalist in ideas, are more baboons that the other who are in the left, that are more advanced as human beings. Nationality haves its rootes on tribalism, and relegion in the comon man's fear of the unknown. Things prehistoric, that suit more the baboon and the early human that the advanced one. Capitalism is in human nature, and this is a fact, not a matter of debate. My point is, that many things in human nature have to disappear, for us to advance. Anyway, about idelogy and non left extermination, a movement that never exterminates the enemy will never to anything, and never reach to its goals. You can disagree with that(you seem anarcho-pacifist, i can not change your opinion, and i dont in fact care changing it, i do this debate for fun anyway) but you have to know that you are blind if you disagree. About statists, i myself threw mood in their faces in the previous writings. Point is, i will support a revolution that is statist, like you support rojava that is also statist. Whatever you and i say, they are statist and not socialist(at least in the classical sense), so i just find it hypocritical that you support rojava(which is by me the right thing to do, considering the other alternatives) and not the commies. About the holomondoe and ukraine, it was probably not planed, and many who sai it was, they will find that their surces are of the dear bourgeoisie. I dont mean to say that stalin was right, but having all the world as enemy, and having survived a civil war that killed 1 10th of the population, it is given your county will go from one hardship to another. Its plain economics. Historical materialism may anwser you this one. And about the state, who said i want to give it unlimited power?

"Drugs in my experience are a tool to deal with trauma. Some like Heroin are risky. I've lost friends to it. Others like lamotrigine are relatively safe. That said, they're both addictive, sold as commodities, and effect a person's behavior. Because of this, we need to see them as being part of what makes up the power of capitalism. They definitely work to manage trauma, but as long as they're commodities and gate-kept by specialists, they will also control the people they're sold to. The anarchist position on drugs can't stop at a person's right to hurt themselves. We need to recognize the role drugs play in maintaining unjust hierarchies and fight against them. We need to recognize the ways people are traumatized by cisheteropariarchy, white supremacy, capital, and the state, and fight them at the source. We also need to create non-commodified ways of healing from and managing trauma. We shouldn't try to re-invent the wheel though, a lot of people have been working on this, you're just more likely to find them in non-profits targeting people of olor than in the anarchist scene.

"-Agree to disagree about capitalism being simply a system I suppose. I still believe it is people and incentives that are the problem. -You can't equate our life in modern society with the life of Harriet Tubman. Of course you can't escape slavery by peaceful means and I would support violence in that situation but we are not slaves today and to view our struggles as the same as hers is to misrepresent history. This is I think the main point of contention for me here, which is that anarchists seem to be unwilling to live the change they want to make in the world. The focus instead seems to be mainly on proselytizing. -what I mean by stability precisely is that we live in a time of the least violence, highest life expectancy, lowest infant mortality rate, lowest levels of poverty, in the history of human existence. There is no point in our past, that would be better to live in then now by nearly every metric safe for maybe the natural world. -There seems to be so much hate for anyone who manages to get any sort of expensive thing coming from the doctrine you abide. I'm by no means rich myself, living paycheck to paycheck but when i see someone in a ferrari I'm not jealous of their good thing.

"I don't think the texts should just be reduced to things that are wholly specific to that time frame. Personally I think it is important to understand how and why Marx and Engels developed the understanding of class struggle and revolution that they did. Even if their conclusions might be very tied to that time frame the methodology is what is important, and the fact that a lot of things still hold up since we still live under capitalism and the writings were analyzing the development of capitalism. I think just calling Rosa Luxemburg a descended of Marx is dangerous, she was very influenced of Kautsky and second international 'orthodox marxism' after all. I don't fully understand how you would reconcile her writings on the party with the thinking of Mattick and even less with Duavé(I've had emails conversations with him but even I have to say that his marxism is very questionable). I don't think it is gatekeeping to say that someone is not a marxist if they borderline actively avoid reading Marx and Engels and dismiss their ideas as just tied to that time frame.

Are we just going to collectively stop using the billions and billions of electronic devices that already exist? Are we going to collectively decide to not utilize the infrastructure and knowledge that we already have to produce more should we need to? The only question that remains is whether or not we can obtain the resources required to produce such things without the massive amounts of exploitation currently required. And considering the absurd scale at which capitalism produces e-waste, I see no reason to think that we couldn't 1) re-purpose a significant number of the billions of existing devices, 2) obtain the resources required to produce more from the waste we already have without engaging in the destructive practices that fuel electronics production under capitalism.

"Drugs. I wouldn't really suggest that approach to most people though. You never truly know how people are gonna react until they try it what with people's diverse neurochemistry and whatnot. I had major chronic depression and severe, anxiety-driven obsessive-compulsion for a solid ten years before I started using cannabis and psychedelics. The cannabis really got me to calm down and gave me the opportunity to think about how I wanted to live, what was and wasn't working for me, etc. I realized the antidepressants and the methylphenidate I was prescribed wasn't really helping and just stopped taking them. After about a half year kind of settling into alternating moods of euphoria and severe depression with small periods of numb, tense emptiness in the interim, a friend who had also been struggling with mental health convinced me to try acid. It really changed everything for me. I had the first spiritual experience of my life. It opened my eyes to the pain that fueled my reactionary rage(at the time I was deep down the anti-feminist rabbit hole), I did a full turn to left libertarianism, started to go vegetarian, and so on, and so on.... I'm not saying it works for everyone, that there aren't risks involved, and that it fixes stuff overnight. I am, however, saying that it worked for me and that if you feel you've tried everything else and it hasn't worked thus far, maybe give it a try. If that is what you decide to do, I wouldn't reccomend rushing into it either. Take your time. Find someone you trust to guide you through the experience. Personally, what keeps me going is I put aside some time for myself where I can just smoke some pot, put on some music, and think to myself.",t3_a2oe4o,Anarchism

"Coercion. It is not hard to encourage meaningful contribution on the part of all who benefit from society. For example having positive mentors throughout ones life can help maintain a healthy engagement with ones community. If one has an appreciation for his neighbors and what they do he is more likely to want to participate in the community, whatever way that may be. The problem of 'laziness' is one that primarily arises in western and especially capitalistic societies. For example in traditional Native American societies laziness was harshly frowned upon, and people avoided laziness due to social pressure to be helpful. Those societies were much more egalitarian and communistic than anything seen in western society and the coercive pressure for everyone to pull their weight in some way was enough to keep those who would abuse the system in check. In modern societies you can see the use of coercion in small things like parking meters, which coerce people to move their vehicles so as not to be permanently in the way of commerce. In other words if society is overburdened with bags of dicks with no sense of common decency you can fine them for not doing the things they should be doing as a mater of principle.

"White 'culture' is a hegemony of bullshit, certain groups become white based on how useful they become for the system. What would you say 'white cuisine' consists of 80% foods stolen from Turtle Island, 20% co-opted from other continents. Without Native and African genocides you wouldn't have your fucking coffee, chocolate and potato. Can you name a genre of music shared by and credited to white people, or any sort of historical experience that binds them? As a composer I can answer this. NONE of modern music are 'white' music. Jazz and blues developed completely separated root from Euro-classical. In fact blues was developed in African continent hundred years before colonial time, while jazz originated from Trinidad. Rock and pop were from jazz and disco, another genre first developed by early POC DJs. Pop and rock only became white after Elvis Presley co-opted it, gave birth to metal. Punk originated from ska and reggae, Jamaican music culture. Reggae gave birth to jungle and garage, developed in the hood of London. Gave birth to 2-step, which is the pre-genre that gave birth to DnB and dubstep. Trap came from hip-hop. Other genres I didn't mention like dancehall, R&B, metalcore... are also from POC music. So and so. There is no such thing as white culture. Stop co-opting other people's cultures, 'white' people.",t3_a3o17n,Anarchism
"Edit: when I say “Antifa” I am referring to tactics associated with that term. Obviously anarchists have to be antifascist or else they are not anarchists. Antifa has unfortunately made quite a few gaffes. It’s attacks on the right have often served to help vilify the left rather than stop fascism. As someone who actually listen to right wing propaganda all the time (I don’t buy it but it is important to know what others are saying), they harp away on Antifa and it works because Antifa has trouble deciding when it’s a good time and a bad time to use violence. Let me show what I mean with two real examples: Sargon of Akkad gives a talk, protest, don’t storm the stage that made Antifa look real bad and Sargon came out looking like a martyr.

It’s like calling someone a Nazi to me, and I don’t even thing that’s an inaccurate comparison considering the nigh unparalleled scope of colonial genocide committed in Australia.

"Ok, thank you very much. I personally think, that a more central organisation, a speck of democracy based authoritarianism would be more favourable to most. In order to get an organised education system, free and well working health care, a fast helpful response in the case of emergencies and to create a higher productivity in total (a modern societies produktivity is actually extremely large, the living standard is however not nearly as high, as it could be with this productivity) Therefore I would very much favour a more authoritarian system, with a lot of public property,, based in a strong democracy, with a part from social services, the big public economic leverage and stuff like a progressive capital gains tax and stuff to increase cooperation, e.g. to combat climate change. I would however like to give everyone the option to allways live in a anarchist society instead, by having anarchist communitys, which live in a symbiosis with the society I described.

"From the Oxford English Dictionary (not because I think you don't know the definitions but so we're talking about the same things) Intersectionality: 'The interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.' Identity Politics: 'A tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics.' One can acknowledge and value the interconnected nature of social categorizations as they relate to discrimination, without supporting people forming exclusive political alliances based on their identities. For example, I can acknowledge the discrimination faced by a black woman as a result of being black and a woman. But that doesn't mean I believe that black women should form an exclusionary political alliance with only other black women (excluding black men, women of other races, etc.). Mainly because if this runs its full course, then we're left with political groups that only look out for the interests of, for example, poor black trans women. Now, I'm not saying that there shouldn't be political groups that look out for the interests of that population (there absolutely should be); but, if that group is only looking out for the interests of that specific population, 1. It runs the risk of having no real political power because it lacks numbers to be a real political force, and 2.

"I meant to respond to your point about me confusing hatred for what the object represents for hatred of the owner. The problem with that statement is that the owner does not see it your way. They are not returning to find their vehicle destroyed and then being profoundly affected by the underlying political motivations of anarchism. Their response is completely disconnected from politics. Instead it ruins their day, maybe week, maybe month, maybe year, maybe even their life depending on their financial ability to rebound, what sort of consequence not having a vehicle that day resulted in or what irreplaceable personal affects were in the vehicle. Now you will likely respond by saying it’s not the owner in this case that you are trying to reach, it’s the lowly “workers” whatever that means. I’d consider my cousin a lowly “worker” by your standards, however she also saved her pennies and bought a low model BMW. So she could potential be both the target of your anger and the target of your message. The public at large lead nuanced lives and to condemn people based on items they own, or the items themselves is in my opinion misled. I think the broad effect of anarchist actions have an overwhelming negative return of support contrary to your hypothesis of 200 “workers” for every 100 infuriated car owners, because those lowly “workers” have dreams of rising up the ladder and so they champion the system that oppresses them. I think yo vastly underestimate the ratio of “workers” to the corporate elites. The majority of us are working for someone. Managers have managers and they have CEOs. I think the anarchist community vastly over estimates the effect that riots and vandalism have on change and it’s because of the adventure and excitement of it. I mean it’s referred to as riot porn. It’s not taken seriously and treated with a mature reverence as a noble political movement, it’s billed as fun way to say fuck you to the establishment and air your grievances. But the thing is, they’ve been aired. Everyone is “woke” now, everyone gets it, but the establishment keeps winning because they are better at marketing, they are better making actual changes for better or worse, and they are better doing it with a dull lull. That is why I’m convinced that you have to start living the change you want to see. Become a politician and bring it all down from inside. Infiltrate institutions and change them. Innovate industries. Start your own company and make a co-op. It’s hard for the public to look at anarchists for leadership when all they offer is an objection to everything.

Yes i'm well aware of the media monopoly, however my opinions about anarchism are based on information from sites like 'It's going down,' and other independent anarchist media that my radical anarchist friend shares with me. I want to put a question to you to crystallize your position in my mind. Assuming that your wildest dreams of anarchism come true, a no doubt through the success of your chosen methods of destruction, after the dust settles, you will have to start establishing new institutions to manage the needs of human life. This means that after all the fun of the rioting is over, you'll have to work together to design a new society. You'll have to put in some work. So my question is, why not just start now by doing the work, i.e. the co-op idea? Or any other of a myriad of ways that you could affect change in real time? It seems like the logic is to procrastinate on the hard part and focus on the fun part, and you're likely safe in the notion that revolution is unlikely in your life time so the hard part is easy to ignore and rationalize away. I personally think you could affect change way more by actually creating change within this broken system and influence others to do the same until society is unrecognizable and for the better. Do you honestly believe that in your life time you can affect more long lasting change by your current methods than by what I've suggested? ",t3_a3xx0v,Anarchism

">You’re free to fuck off to the woods. Except I’m not, because the woods are disappearing, they don’t produce nearly as much food as they once did, I’d be arrested for squatting on government (or private) land, and I’d eventually be hunted down for not paying taxes. I try to spend as much time as possible in the wilderness as it is, but it simply doesn’t work like that. My point here being that any system you put in place is going to end up like that. Civilization necessarily isn’t sustainable, because you cannot have infinite growth with finite resources. It will constantly eat away at the Earth. It’s happening now. It will probably happen in the future. Even if I *could* fuck off and live in the forest, civilization would catch up to me. The forest would slowly die and disappear, the animals would leave and migrate to greener pastures, the rivers would become polluted beyond usability or dry up altogether. This is why indigenous brown people around the world are being forced to integrate into colonial societies, and forced off their traditional lands. >Other people are going to want polio vaccines and running water. I’m not opposed to polio vaccines and running water. I’m opposed to being held at gun point to produce polio vaccines and running water systems. I don’t care what other people want, until it infringes on me. As the Yazidi holy book states: “I let all men follow the dictates of their own nature, but those who oppose me shall regret it sorely.” Your point here is essentially that you want the luxuries of civilization, and you want to impose a coercive system to get them (which is a tautology really.) You can deny it, but what you want is to force *me* to work for *your* system because *you* want things. I have no obligation to you or anyone else. I don’t want a “mass revolution,” if that implies a new system just as coercive as the last. I want a mass collapse.

Anarchy is created through global revolution, 2 many generations go by and values are lost 3 some parts of the world set up, revive or continue religion. Others choose to leave the idea of anarchists thought for either democracies or republics. Some may even choose to directly reinstate monarchy or an ethnostate. 4 hierarchies gain, power, divine right and trust from the community. 5 Take over other communes and oppress the weak because it would help there own interests 6 feudal system begins again where the powerful own the weak 7. History has it has been since then repeats itself. Or single out anarchists revolutions begin 1. Civil war 2. Anarchist commune 3. Immediately taken over by larger country or dictatorship among the powerful. That is how I see it playing out and I have seen no arguments presented against this. These seem to be inevitable parts of human nature. Greed is very natural it is why we have surpassed all other animals.

That's why most anarchists reject it and I agree with their conclusions about it. Also anarchism as a philosophical tradition is much older than ancap which was invented a few decades ago and anarchism grew out of the left-wing socialist movement whereas ancap grew out of the right-wing libertarian movement, which makes them seem like entryists.

To me - and based on my quick skimming of the nihilism section of the book you mentioned - nihilism does have certain motivations. It rejects meaning and purpose, but a nihilist can still be brought to action and many I've spoken to suggest we can 'create our own meaning'. There are actually a few pessimists who share this belief as well. They might call themselves 'positive pessimists' and argue that their negativity gives them some kind of advantage in life. Me personally, I am an absolute existential pessimist. It is not because my life is particularly bad, or the world is bad, or life itself is bad, though I could argue each of these with some level of confidence. No, to the absolute pessimist, existence and the very thought of existing is bad, and cannot be fixed or altered to any acceptable state. Revolt has no merit, except perhaps to quell boredom. Happiness, suffering, the conditions of existence, are all just details of an ultimately evil cosmos. So that would be the main difference I guess.

If Lenin did not did what he did, about the collectives, then we would expect that there would be never soviet union, cause we would see the outcome of the german revolutions repeating itself again in russia. And many things would change if the soviet union never brought into place, so i will not go deeper in that.

">At that point there is no argument that holds water for raising and slaughtering of animals But the argument for that doesn't hold water *now*, so why does the invention of lab-grown meat matter? It doesn't. The ethical and environmental motivation toward veg\*ism precedes a newfangled technical solution. What you're saying is, how can people reconcile their unethical desire to satisfy a taste for meat with a desire to be ethical and then interposing a technological solution that cuts the Gordian knot rather than providing an actual ethical solution. It's not a solution; it's a metasolution, akin to turning over the board and declaring victory rather than discovering the correct move. If we're interested in ethical decisions, which the OP seems to be, there is already an ethical solution to eating meat: don't. Really, the defense that meat tastes good is so childish and it betrays an utter lack of seriousness about the issue. There are arguments in favor of eating meat that deserve careful consideration—the health of pregnant mothers, for instance—but a wanton retreat to 'taste' is not one of them.

"Neoclassical economics are based on the rational actor model. It's only in the last few decades with the cognitive revolution do we understand that we're just a mishmash of heuristics and social proofing. Multidisciplinary fields like behavioural economics draw upon the current cog psych. The thing on a lot of work from Tversky and Kahneman. Classical economics uses the rational actor as its basis for decision-making. FWIW, Smith's goal was to find natural laws for economics like Newton had done for physics. It was the spirit of the times, and rationality was deemed what made us human. The market is just a mathematical construct. That's why the Rationalists embraced it as the arbiter of resources. It was superior to the absolute authority of Church and the State. Liberalism's approach to rights, the rule of law, and democracy all came from the same place. The capability of reason and rationality is what made us all equal, and so if you weren't successful in the market or in democracy, it was because you were irrational or uninformed. Obviously we know that things are a little more complex than that now. But as with all work, you build upon what previous researchers did, and prod away at their ideas. You also have to look at the entire body of academic disciplines because they don't exist in a vacuum. They're all using different methodologies, and many are overlapping in the same results. When you have one field (free market economics) you tend to get results that don't jive with the rest of the social sciences.

This is why we have China, that mixes the worst tendencies of traditional 'socialist' state capitalism dictatorship with free-market capitalism to great success , perplexing people who were taught that this was an impossibility since freer markets inevitably lead to more democratic and freer societies (turns out capitalism regardless of form in the end mostly favour those who control a lot of capital already, who would've thought?). Apparently we learned nothing from the 30's and 40's about how fascists promising to make their countries 'great again' goes on to curb the few freedoms we have, working together with the rich and the powerful ('the swamp', as the American right likes to put it) to lower wages and workers' influence over the condition of their toil and life in general, while claiming to represent the 'small guy' and draining said swamp. They don't. They use inflammatory rhetoric, nationalism and patriotism to foster a sense of people being equal because of their nationality while inequality soars, and keep us divided by fanning the flames of racism, homophobia and misogyny, blaming the fall of Western democracy on 'cultural marxists' and muslims while they are the ones in power destroying what's left of it and profiting on it together.

I don't buy into the individualist vs collectivist framework, let alone the lifestylist vs social anarchist bullshit, but I think that Crimethinc. does put too much onus on the individual to modify their life in a way that neglects a lot of organizing work and a decent analysis of privilege of any kind.

"Who takes to the streets first, the riot police, or the masked radicals? The police are in the streets every day. I mean, the less-pithy and more academic response is that just because the owner class's violence against the poor is systematized instead of individual, that doesn't make it less real nor self-defense against it less righteous. But, like... the police are also in the streets beating people. All the time. Not just on protest days and not just the 'riot' cops. Do you really think the government is going to mobilize the military against us as the public organizes and reduces it's dependence on capitalism over time? I just don't believe that. I'm sure it will start with the lawyers, and then if I don't desist, the military -- by which I mean the police, which is an armed peacekeeping force relying on violence -- will arrive to speak with me next. Both are Capitalist superpowers running the same social software. Are they really? Religion is a joke in France, as is the authoritarian family thanks to socialized child care -- these are two structures that beat the rebellious impulse out of you early and often. France has a fresher tradition of major revolution, and also of guerilla resistance. The last few years the states has had several mass scale riots, which I actually found justified in the face of racially motivated violence by the police. That was, and maybe still is, a situation where rioting is warranted. So violent expression on the basis of a direct attack on a race is okay, but not on the basis of class, which is nearly as indelible a divisor, and not on the bases of indirect attacks like selective enforcement of drug policy, regressive taxes, and electoral tampering?",t3_a3xx0v,Anarchism

It is also considered an essential economic strategy responding to the limits-to-growth dilemma (see The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries and post-growth). Degrowth thinkers and activists advocate for the downscaling of production and consumption—the contraction of economies—arguing that overconsumption lies at the root of long term environmental issues and social inequalities.

"So you’re making a purity argument. You’re saying the US is abstractly imperialist, therefore any concrete relationship it enters into is inherently imperialist. That’s not only bad logic, it’s idealist. US acts aren’t imbued with imperialism like venom. Imperialism materially exists within institutions to the extent social and political actors create actually imperialist relations. The question should be, “Does US involvement in the DFNS increase solidarity for socialist and liberatory aims or does if not?” In other words, imperialism and revolution are *subcontraries* rather than contraries. That is, they are related as things which can both be true but not both false, as opposed to contraries which can both be false but not both true. I’m only untangling the logical relations. Whether or not my formulation is correct depends on us investigating empirical reality. We won’t get anywhere with platitudes about *true* anarchism. The “how” of organization remains ever pertinent. But don’t neglect that having clear reasons “why” remains necessary to begin organizing. I agree Americans can’t support the DFNS when they can’t organize themselves, which I why I think you should shift your condemnation. That shouldn’t make us snicker at seemingly futile attempts to liberate society. It should make us urge those with the ability to help to organize themselves. *Why?* For the sake of liberation, at home and abroad.

">Prices still function off of supply and demand I don't think my rent went up because of supply or demand though, my landlord made it clear it was based off of market value for an apartment of this type. You simplify the problem and ignore market forces and competition when you say it's all down to supply and demand. If my landlord 'cheats' because they want more money to feed their kids (best faith interpretation), then my apartment is 'worth more' and other landlords in the area raise prices on theirs to not leave profit on the table, no cartel needed (hard to stop w/o state intervention...). I'm not saying our current system of minimum wage is any better, a 'fight for 15' has the same problems as it doesn't place any limitations on the owners of the means of production to act outside of a profit motive. But to say that an influx in the supply of spendable money won't lead to inflation that will outpace the added income supplied by it is extremely hopeful and I feel will actually put more people into precarious living positions rather then less.

"There are various ways of conveying the meaning of 'anarchism', but at its core we can expect that it is a movement in pursuit of *an-arche*, which is often simplified as 'no rulers', but carries a slightly more complex definition as Steven Pearl Andrews shows us: >*Arche* is a Greek word (occurring in mon-*archy*, olig-*archy*, hier-*archy*, etc.), which curiously combines, in a subtle unity of meaning, the idea of *origin* or *beginning*, and hence of *elementary principle*, with that of *government* or *rule*. Consequently, we can imagine that 'anarchism' is indiscriminate in its elimination of 'archies', something that isn't reflected in the state-centric opposition of the anti-state capitalists. Their theory doesn't seem to offer any structural critiques beyond the state itself (and even then for different reasons), instead concentrating on assuring voluntary association within authoritarian frameworks. Where anarchist theory has identified and critiqued structures of authority, or hierarchies, since its beginnings, anti-state capitalist theory is really neoliberalism taken to its most radical form, with a marked inability to break out of authoritarian mindsets (for example, a continued insistence on some form of *law*, even if it's stateless, and the insistence on particular prohibitions). The anti-state capitalists define *authority* in ways that conflate it with *force* (which is reminiscent of some of the most historically confused arguments against anti-authoritarianism), while simply naturalising actual authority into property relationships and 'rights', which is not consistent with *anarchy*. Regarding 'capitalism', it first appeared in French and as you probably know, was coined by opponents. Interestingly, unlike 'socialism', its definition didn't appear to be subject to as much struggle in the early days, with the general sentiment being a kind of 'financial and industrial feudalism' until some defenders of existing economic relationships picked up the term and used a broad definition of 'free enterprise'. But if the term is *capital*\-ism, then we can expect that any definition should focus on the status of *capital* and its holders, who are naturally privileged in ways that are inconsistent with *anarchy*. Propertarians who would prefer to define 'capitalism' as simply 'free trade' often rely on naturalising relationships and conditions in a capitalist society (arguments relating to 'risk' and 'time preference', for example), usually in ways that are ahistorical as far as I can tell.",t3_a7rli1,Anarchism

"'Only way' is authoritative. What makes this the 'only way'? 'Society manages production, and humans are free to work their respective interests' is detached. Production and interest can be one and the same. What exactly do you have in mind when you're talking about 'production'? Local ecology and culture plays a significant role in the organization and production specialization/capacity/interest of localized communities. I think the lay of the land (so to speak) largely determines what can and should be done. I'm not sure this bureaucratic statistical data collection and reference is necessary. People can communicate to one another needs and desires quite easily between groups in times of need. Social interactions are more qualitative and personal (personable, humane) that way.

Foucault argues that prison did not become the principal form of punishment just because of the humanitarian concerns of reformists. He traces the cultural shifts that led to the predominance of prison via the body and power.

Native is the longest known group or perhaps the founding population of a country. Anglo-Saxons are native to England because they came together as a people in Britain and formed England. This was accepted long before dna testing showed that the English are mostly descended from the original population anyway.

**Discipline and Punish** Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (French: Surveiller et punir : Naissance de la prison) is a 1975 book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. It is an analysis of the social and theoretical mechanisms behind the changes that occurred in Western penal systems during the modern age based on historical documents from France. Foucault argues that prison did not become the principal form of punishment just because of the humanitarian concerns of reformists. He traces the cultural shifts that led to the predominance of prison via the body and power. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,t3_a3o8mp,Anarchism

Basically I believe the BPP would 90% be remembered the same and accomplished the same if they hadn't done armed cop watches or armed anything for that matter. As for the Bundys, You credit guns with the Bundys being able to rob BLM basically, to prevent BLM from taking the cattle. But just like Fred Hampton, if the feds really wanted those cattle some armed citizens wouldn't stop them, they'd just go take them by surprise at night. That the cattle ultimately were not taken, to me, suggests they were only a bargaining chip from the beginning and their relinquishment to the government was never likely or the ultimate goal (because it was too politically costly, not physically dangerous). I've been around many government seizures; the feds never give back what they want to take, even if some hicks in the road have guns, it just seems ludicrous to me.

The Angel tries to stay low-key only allows himself to be visible to the donkey Balaam's riding, so the donkey keeps veering away from Balaam's intended destination. Balaam loses it starts thrashing the donkey, so Satan steps in, revealing himself to Balaam, telling him he'd have had to kill Balaam if he'd gone any further. This is basically Satan's role, working as God's cop prosecutor.

"Okay... I'm not particularly interested in changing your view on r/anarchism because I don't really care. What I will address is the second section: Many anarchists don't want an alternative to capitalism, they want a fundamentally different way of life, beyond merely a new system/way of organizing things. What we want is deceptively simple: The opportunity to invent new ways of life unfettered. The state, money, capitalist society, that shit gets in the way of us trying to live. We don't want anything in particular, other than the freedom to make their own lives. The discussion of 'alternatives' is good for fiction. Utopian literature needs to return to help calibrate our brains to desire what lies beyond. But when it comes to practical action, none of us know except at the broadest level what questions will even be posed by revolution, nor do any of us know what will emerge on the other side of capitalism. All anarchists know is that we want to escape; For us, a neutral world is better than a brutal one, and a good world would be the icing on the cake.

"about stalin, the circumstances made him what he was. At his time, being a dictactor was not a thing. Also, we had to fight both the west and the nazis, so given that, 'his government was fighting an actual civil war, world war, and cold war'. I hope this anwsers it. Sure, not going to deny the circumstances made him what he was. &#x200B; But he literally sent political dissidents to gulags, and centralised agriculture in a way that caused roughly 3 million Ukranians to starve to death. &#x200B; 'I'm going to send dissidents to gulags and intentionally starve out an entire region' is not even remotely on the same level as 'We're going to temporarily tolerate some capitalist industries because we don't want to piss off the tribes under our protection' First, the arguement about the police reinforces the marxist one of 'using the state to abolish the state' Not really. &#x200B; The Marxist idea is to centralise the state, and have it hand-hold the people under it until they eventually learn to perform it's functions without it. &#x200B; Rojava has always had a small-scale, community oriented federation of direct democracies, and is slowly decreasing it's own power. It started off as semi-Libertarian Socialist, and is trying to become even more so. &#x200B; A Libertarian Socialist Federation trying to abolish it's own state powers is very different from a centralised oligarchic government trying to abolish it's own state powers, for what I hope are obvious reasons. and about the co ops, if you give a read about their economy, is convienent for them to use it. In Norway, 1 million out of five, is in a trade union, so one could argue that the Norway government does not make any steps to stop that, so, is this makes Norway socialist? I Difference is, Rojava originally set out to make property laws function on a use basis in the first place. They originally set it out that homes and businesses would be run as co-operatives. They destroyed many original property records from the Assad regime so they could do this. &#x200B; Private Property was only introduced as a concept when they later liberated more regions from ISIS and didn't want to enforce there will on people outside their established communities. First, the revolution that happend before lenin, was a bourgeoisie. Private property existed, and the rich continiued to be rich. Sure, I agree. He should have abolished private property and the rich. &#x200B; HOWEVER, you can abolish private property and the rich AND let worker run collectives work in peace can you not? &#x200B; Why does it have to be an either-or?, why not allow workers to run their own workplaces without state intervention?, Why demand that all business once property is abolished be done through the centralised state giving you power? &#x200B; Why demand that the state interferes with the freedom of workers to organise on their own? About the last one about siding with someone, first this does not anwsers my questions, and second your arguements only enpower my own arguements and the arguements a classial ol' communist or state socialist would use. The USSR doesn't exist any more. There's no legitimate super-power funding revolutions. You can't just wave the black and red flag and expect someone to give you funding. &#x200B; Modern civil wars work as proxy wars.

The most common capital gains are realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, and property. Not all countries implement a capital gains tax and most have different rates of taxation for individuals and corporations. For equities, an example of a popular and liquid asset, national and state legislation often has a large array of fiscal obligations that must be respected regarding capital gains. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a67p5f,Anarchism

"What did he say? Edit: I looked it up on YT. It seems he said that he heard / all he hears is that white farmers are being killed in South Africa. I basically agree with what the guy in the video says who is criticising Joe Rogan. I think he's sloppy and doesn't make much of an effort to challenge some things that he should. I don't think he's an alt-right believer, he's more of a fairly politically ignorant dude bro. I wouldn't call him a piece of shit (I would save that for people like Richard Spencer), but I agree with you wholeheartedly has a responsibility to be more diligent about this stuff because he has a large following who hangs on his every word. One of the reasons I'm bothering to say this is I've grown weary of the pattern of leftists dehumanising anybody who says dodgy things. It's a black and white way of viewing the world, which necessarily distorts how we see things, and also pushes us away from more and more people until we can only tolerate other radical leftists. I've done this for years and have come to the conclusion that it's misguided. People are complicated and unless we are actually able to tolerate the fact that people are complex, and that some dodgy opinions don't mean that a person is devoid of goodness and is a lost cause, our project of social transformation is moot. In fact, up until recently I wrote-off Joe Rogan as a prick/scumbag/whatever because of what I heard him say about trans people / feminism. Then I decided to take a more nuanced view, and say that while I don't need to accept his views, I can understand that he's trying to figure things out but is ignorant in some ways. For instance, I used to have all sorts of 'problematic' views about trans people before I educated myself about it, and it would be hypocritical of me to write somebody off as a person if I wouldn't want somebody to write me off 6-7 years ago. That doesn't mean people need to like Joe Rogan. Sorry this comment ended up being so long. I think it's an important issue which goes beyond Rogan. ",t3_a791fq,Anarchism

The day he gets a libertarian socialist or any type of leftist on the show will be the day I won’t find him at least a little bit intellectually dishonest. Right now he is selling his content to his viewers as being a wide open range of political thought, which is simply incorrect. Edit: the reason why this is important is because he is not for liberty - he is for conservatism.

"Voting for the lesser evil is not free. Humans have finite energy and ability to care. Electoral campaigns don't create or sustain movements, they actually deflate movements by redirecting energy to a captive process. Money, hope, and volunteers dumped into electoral campaigns could do real good otherwise. Your plea is a common refrain of electoralists: that you must vote and then hold the elected official's feet to the fire. But the design of the system militates against that because you're trying to impose a harder task as energy is flagging, and because you're trying to put a demand on an official at the moment when they have the least need of you and the highest possible chance that you'll forget the issue before the next election. Voting for the lesser evil doesn't make life better. If you're not part of whichever *causes célèbres* the lesser evil is co-opting to sustain itself this election cycle, your life will get worse under them. If you are part of those cases, your life will still probably get worse, because while the lesser evil is talking up the hot issue to ennoble itself it's still accepting attacks on other rights that aren't currently being observed. Because it is, after all, evil.

"Only people without honor think that the honor system is a joke. Humanity survived for hundreds of thousands of years on the basis of honor and community.

I'm in the US so this may be a little different, but not a single teacher I know got into the profession because of incentives. They did it out of a love and compassion for the future. We farm because we all need to eat. The gathering of food has been a communal work that has been done out of necessity for all of human history. If you're too lazy to help with the food needs of your community, the community has ways to pressure you into growing the fuck up. If you're physically unable to help in some way, historically, the community has taken care of you with the understanding that you contribute however you can. In our capitalist system, people who are disabled often fall through the cracks and left to starve on the streets. We do work because it needs doing, we innovate because we are curious.

The only thing which makes us human (among all other living beings) is reasoning. So my only joy is; I am living with reason. Even if I can’t help myself, still inside my mind I am comparatively free, free to think, free to contemplate.

So lets cling on to life (life with reason), the system is collapsing already, and it is making big impacts on general consciousness of society.

"In my current opinion Capitalism, which I used blame everything on, is not exactly the real problem. The problem is human beings and what our incentives are. Capitalism is simply a ledger, a social contract that allows us to be highly specialized and exchange our goods and services. It's people that are the problem and until we solve the problem with our incentives, it doesn't matter what system we try to create because greed and hunger for power will resurface. This is why I'm interested in people doing and showing rather than telling. Why not try to create a microcosm of the society that you want to live in somewhere in the world right now in your life time? Start by slowly removing yourself from the capitalist world one day at a time. Stop using money wherever possible by building a community of people with all the skills and resources you need and openly trade each others goods and services. If it's truly a better system it will helplessly catch on and expand. I simply do not believe that the CIA would be interested in this type of 'hippy,' for lack of a better word, experiment unless you continued to attract negative attention by dawning masks and lighting the city on fire. We as consumers hold all the cards, we prop up the powerful, so if you want to inspire us to change our incentives away from material wealth and status, you need to use whats proven to work. Marketing! I just don't see the riot side of anarchism, ever being able to inspire civilization. It's super complicated. If we take the Starbucks example, you and I might despise starbucks and what it represents. I'd way rather have random little coffee spots with soul to them playing music I like etc, but for someone like my friend Dave who loves starbucks, it's great. Every where he goes his favorite coffee shop is close by. And there's a shit load of people like Dave, the majority in fact. It's the same with everything. The majority of people enjoy the mainstream. So how does anarchism combat that while still upholding freedom? Can I own and run one coffee shop? How about two? What if people really like my coffee shop and its lined up out the door everyday? Can I build a few more to give people more access to what I'm creating that they seem to love. There's a million and one scenarios and questions like this that we need to consider and that's just in western societies, never mind all of the other different countries and societies with all of their opinions of ow society should operate. It all just seems so complicated the to me destroying the fragile stability we've established so far in this blink of human history, is the wrong move. I think we need to continue trying to change our incentives. People should be trying to be successful for the prestige of it and the admiration of their peer and the betterment of mankind, not for material wealth. Every car that gets burned, and every business that gets smashed is maybe 100 or 1000 people who saw that or owned those, who is a lost opportunity at an ally because you prejudged who they are based solely on the fact that they followed the flow chart of western life that was set before them. Of course they have all the trappings of a western life but that's what they were born into. Those are the incentives they've been born into. You know how rare it is for someone to be born into a structure and then form an objective view about that structure and have opinions that may go against it? You have to be a moral hero.

A possible or common failure of the individualist is to not apply to others the autonomy they themselves seek - but by their philosophy, this should not be the case (unlike right-wing libertarianism, which in Ayn Randian fashion glorifies placing one's autonomy over others). In this way I am quite sympathetic to individualism, and in some ways I see it as the beating heart of anarchism - the respect and taking seriously of individual autonomy within a society is what makes anarchism stand out from other forms of socialism or collectivism. To me, this is merely what it means to require *voluntary* cooperation. That said, so-called individualists who think any society is coercive seem to be thinking mostly about their own autonomy, not so much about others. Of course, there are good reasons for this - many people are drawn to this precisely because they have been so violated by society - whether social norms that are sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc., or by brutal implementations of those social norms such as draconian laws (from drug laws to laws making homelessness illegal). Our society is tyrannical, and tends to violate the individual rather thoroughly. Many individualists then are reactionary - many are burnt out on society and want an alternative, and they aren't all that interested in how social cohesion may work out, or how federated, large-scale cooperation would work. In reaction to the violence from society, society itself becomes an enemy, and they aren't interested in a *new* society as much as a safety *from* society. It is one of the biggest problems in anarchism to resolve this problem: how do we work with these people, how do we respect their autonomy and learn from their suffering? It should inform us about what any social anarchist endeavor would look like. But we also want to be clear about what anarchism is and isn't - and there is a lot of conflict with many of these individualists on this topic. Many want to argue any society or social anarchism violates anarchy, and thus isn't anarchism. Meanwhile, social anarchists want to claim individualists aren't anarchists because they are so willing to violate others' autonomy and wage personal wars, against the spirit of any society. This is a challenge I am not sure how to resolve. On the one hand, I am inclined to reject the individualist for being anti-social. Any anarchist who takes autonomy seriously should consider more than just their own. On the other, this creates a real tension (possibly unsolvable) between the individual and society. At what point does society become coercive, even if nominally 'voluntary'? How do we resolve problems, such as the fact that society *is* oppressive for many people, and these individualists may be completely justified in feeling attacked and wanting to exert their autonomy by pushing back? I don't have answers, but I do think we shouldn't reject either - we should be listening and incorporating both individualist and social interpretations of anarchism to inform how we relate to one another and how society should be structured.

One of my other jobs was to analyze and predict geopolitical changes in order to give us a strategy of what we might be dealing with. It taught me a lot about how fragile the world is, and how bad it is about to go, but it also taught me strategy. Climate change is forcing people to migrate, and push for more resources, and the beginnings of that in most countries looks like the way that life is right now. If we do not do something before the next crisis happens, we are well and truly fucked. No one is about to have gas for example, and people are going to be essentially isolated from anything that need here, and THEN it's about to get wild.

Are you making the case that the susceptibility of our minds due to cultural norms is a case to dismiss anything the person has to say on a subject? People can be immoral and moral on different levels. The problem is to idealize people dogmatically. Hume was a product of his time and environment but he did establish theories of morality and human nature towards a better future. Many of the people you are naming have said awful things but they've also done great things relative to the time they were in.

Overriding respect for individuals is needed because the impetus to fix problems comes from individuals standing up and saying that the current system isn't working for them, and it's not moral to insist that they be able to participate in complex arguments in order to be heard. The ability to refuse -- to say 'fuck off' -- also has to be respected. Vulgarity might be the stupid man's wit but society is required to be agreeable to the stupid man also.

The fact that the author seems to think that 'peripheral France' means only redneck voting far right, and even if it's the majority, it's not the case of everyone.

However the context is still specific enough that I think the phrase 'Cyntoia Brown killed her rapist/captor' is an incomplete/misleading picture, especially when her actual captor, her pimp, is a part of the story.

"You are the army, and you should be saving up food and bullets. At least that's my approach, but I also know I would make a terrible soldier and instead am going to be a runner/camper/am currently a propagandist. If you are able bodied on the other hand you should be linking up with your local left-wing militias, worldwide. If there isn't one near you you should be forming one. Even if you're not going to be a fighter they're still going to need logistical support, think about existing militaries, 99% of jobs are not infantry, it's mostly support roles. Revolutions are no different. If you have absolutely no idea where to start I would suggest going to /r/socialistra /r/ExtinctionRebellion /r/redneckrevolt The revolution is going to be worldwide and it's going to be popping off probably sooner than later, for a preview of why that is please see /r/collapse. Don't stay there too long, just to get the general idea and move on. When capitalism fails you get fascism/autarky, if the revolution does not get ahead of the state the state will determine your fate. This goes for everywhere, there are no exceptions. The state are full of sleeping fascists, this is not a problem you're going to want to pussyfoot around. Cells are already forming, join up or start finding an exit route that makes sense for you and yours. But honestly where are you going to go in the worldwide Revolution other than the wilderness? Either fight or flee but hurry up and decide which you are going to do because you may not have time to save up the amount of food that you need or the amount of bullets that you need, and if you're poor like me you're going to need every advantage possible, not least of which is time. My plan is to ride it out in the woods but I've been saving food for years now, literally the day Trump was elected because I knew something stupid was going on and it was going to require guns and lots of food, when the most powerful country in the world has a man like Donald Trump at its helm you know things have gone screwy and we need to take rash action, even if you live nowhere near the United States, especially if you live nowhere near the United States. I know capitalism sucked before Trump and business as usual has been killing the planet since the beginning of the Holocene, but if you didn't freak out and go buy a bunch of guns and food when frog memes decided an election then I'm not sure what to say to you, good luck I guess. All of you non-americans are going to be our support network and we're going to need every hand that we can possibly get because this military is insanely large, you are our backbone, and there is no doing this thing without you. Some of you will be secretaries, some of you smugglers, somebody's got to cook the food, going to be janitors and shit too. Not everybody has to be an antifa super soldier. Even broken people like me can still be propagandists, which is what I'm doing here. Lol, I'm even being paid to do so I mean go ahead and do this ethical consumption under capitalism thing, or at least attempt it, it sounds well-intentioned and it might have some great impact on the world.

Therefore, Stalin did nothing wrong (that's what they are saying to themselves). The real problem we have is that the right has framed the discussion for us for far too long. If we could disavow the Stalin while also successfully avoiding the 'not real Communism' trap the right likes to spring on us I think there would be a lot less Stalin apologists.",t3_a8o96m,Anarchism

Special attention should be paid to finding space in the broadcast dial/schedule for niche programming that will be inherently *un*popular, but extremely vital to the niche it serves. Also, you'll have to setup some institution that protects journalists in their imperiled hours. A journalist can't serve like the head of a consulta/consensus type thing because they are often playing the role of fact-referee between intractably opposing sides.

The focus should be showing people why anarchism works and why they should fight for it, but to not lead a vanguard for the revolution as if everyone else were just waiting for the revolution to start before pitching in.

"About the stalin, (fuck, i hate it when i have to defend him), he kill few compared to other nations like US or Germany. First, he did right to kill non leftists, this is why the soviet union lived so long, about the others just do you research and you will see that what stalin ded, was because he ruled the biggest country on earth. Rojava haves, how many, 1-2 millions? Soviet union haf 150 millions at a time the world population was 2-3 billions, so if you see it relatively, rojava could not be so poure if it had, lets say 50 millions. About the collectives, this can be anwsered only if you do a bit of research, even anarchists who fought there debunk the 'socialist' stance of rojava. Rojava, never, or very rarely speaks about the class war or internationalis, they are more patriotic than socialists, and also is their war. About Marx, i bet my liver you have not yer read any of him(MARX, not about Marx, his books and his ideas), cause Marx never spoke about a centralized state(Marx vision was more about the one you are describing, co ops, locals communitions, a.t.c). Lenin spoke about that and he founded his own deviation, Leninism or Vanguardism at the time, which for me, and for most of those who know a bit of history, economics or real time politics, was the right to do. Why you may ask? Cause the tsarists were still very strong, and the threat of outside intervision was also strong, and lets not speak of the people, who a bit majority, did not know a bit about communist ideals. So, if he did not had a centralised state, he would not have an army, nor he would respond quick and efficient to the tsarists, fifth columnists, and foreighn intervision. If you know history, you would know about the US led invasion of soviet union during the civil war. So, he needed to centralise the state(why i am defending Lenin?LOL) The type of government that you suggest, free working co ops, at the time was PROVEN to be ineffective, multiple times. About the last thing about annexation e.t.c, e.t.c, Annexations of what? The point is, that my arguements is proven again here. The rojava revolution is a nationalistic war. Second. If your 'ally' betrays you, you dont lick his boots. They will turn to Assad anyway, so better they had to Assad(they toorned to him in Afrin, so my arguement is proven again.) The americans gave their leadership money and power, this is why they continiued to lick their boots. And about tolerance to capitalism. Its not just tolerance, its is 100% in their ideology for capitalism to exist. Its written in their constitution, e.t.c e.t.c. Their ideology of ol' bookchin is not socialistic in nature,but more similar to nordic system. And, as i said i am not against rojava, the problem of mine you see, is with some anarchist hypocrites, who support rojava but not the russian revolution that was socialist 100%.

They don't care abou destroying their 'enemies', they care about maintaining a global hegemony, and will fund anyone who keeps Russia in check and helps them fight the most pressing concerns.

You are right in that, but, point is, that these revolutions, were not classical communist or marxists, but they were revisionist like the one you are describing. China, and the Soviets, moved more and more to revisionism after stalin died. Seems there is a lot of revisionism in your statist countries huh? &#x200B; Maybe purging so called 'reactionaries' on mass and sending political dissidents to Gulags, and starving out any regions that want independence from you does that.

China, and the Soviets, moved more and more to revisionism after stalin died. Why? Cause as you said they were fake revolutionaries and they wanted profit. About the new capitalistic class. Most of them they were formed by two things. first, these governments become less and less violent(you can search it) and stopped chasing the enemies of socialism, and instead they were more tolerant to the enemy.(for their own profir or because they were stupit). Second, they allowed capitalism to function, like in rojava, even in a minimal stage, and, of course, capitalism, being the human nature, grow more and more stronger again, and we saw the likes of yeltsin and xi xinping.

From the start, US wanted to help the movements that would overthrow assad and enstablish a stronghold in syria by means of a pupet government, like they did in iraq, afghanistan, korea e.t.c(i dont support north by the way, they were ill started from the start). When the syrian rebels failed to become a real threat to assad, mainly because they were never united, US abandoned them, and, after seeing that the kurds were united because of their same nationality, and vision of a free kurdistan, they funded them instead, which proved succesfull as it was proven again in iraq with peshmerga. But, they knew this would not go for too much, cause they would have pressure by turkey. Of course US would go with turkey, cause they are their real allies, so, after achieving something(like the oil of euphrates, but i dupt people are knowing about this, and they really thing US funds the kurds just because they whant to defeat IS) like getting a lot of oil.(did you knew that US-SDF and RUSS-ASSAD were racing against each other between 2017-2018 during the fight against IS in euprhates, over who will control the most oir rich places? This tells us a lot about US interests in Syria and the rojavan leadershp and 'tolarance' to capitalism.) I believe its a pity, cause there are many good revolutionaries in rojava, but as a whole, their 'revolution', is heading on a bad direction. My opinion at least.",t3_a7xrdt,Anarchism

"Well, from what I've been reading it seems that there is controversy over the definition of MI. MI as introduced by Weber implied that the macrostructure is only as valid as it does not contradict the microstructure and events in the microstructure are the basis for events in the macrostructure. In the Austrian School and to a lesser extent classical economics, this translates to the macroeconomy being a result of microeconomic transactions. In the most extreme cases, you find some folks rejecting macroeconomics altogether because they claim its spirit is a top down approach which creates issues at the microlevel. I am yet to make up my mind but so far this is what I have understood to be their position. Your characterisation of MI implies atomicity where the extreme case rejects the sovereignty of the individual in favour of the collective. That thought line I find leads is coercive by nature; while all individuals are members of collectives it is without individuals that no collective action can take place. Therefore, if the responsibility lies with the individuals to act, the liberty to associate with collectives must rest with the individual. And this forms the basis of a free society in my opinion. The coercion of capitalism, nationalism, socialism, fascism racism and sexism rests in the forced association with collective responsibilities forced down on individuals despite they themselves never opting in and never getting the opportunity to opt out. In other words, they violate the consent of association and essentially make you pay for the sins you never commited. And those sins don't have to ever be commited. Someone powerful enough just has to make the claim that some other individual whom they have collectivised you with commited the sin. And the state maintains this legacy (a claim Rothbard makes) in order to protect its regime. It is from this that my love for Marx's revolution and Rothbard's mistrust in the state gives birth to the roots of where my desire to learn anarchism comes from.

For starters, no work and no property are a given for the human community. Additionally, the future will not be like the past. Communism would necessarily be utterly unlike anything that came before it... Perhaps there were neolithic antecedents, but if there were they are long gone now. You speak about hunter-gatherers like there was any sort of similarity between the ways different groups lived, when in reality no two 'hunter-gather' 'tribes' were alike. Wage labor makes qualitatively different forms of human activity quantitatively the same, incorporating and structuring them all as part of the same apparatus, which gives us the illusion that all human activity throughout history can be easily categorized, when in reality it's only our own.

"I don't see why an anarchist society would necessarily have incompetent representatives on an international level. In an anarchist society, positions that need to be filled by an individual, such as a diplomatic representative or ambassador, could be chosen democratically and could also be democratically re-callable to ensure that the representative only has power as long as the people approve of their decisions, when the representative no longer represents the people they can be recalled through election. As well as recallable representatives, the people would be further safeguarded from their representatives by the fact that the decisions the representative makes much be carried out by the people, decisions wouldnt be authority to be obeyed, but a plan to be followed but only if it is a good plan. If their representative ever sells them out, the people just don't comply with what that representative and recall them from their position. As for authoritarian influence from outside, what authority would they exploit? Representatives are very easily removed from power and their decisions must be enacted by the people. Workplaces are run democratically without bosses or CEOs so there is no corporate ladder to climb and gain influence. It couldn't be done on an individual level, sending tens of thousands of operatives with the intent to influence the society while masquerading as immigrants would most likely be a logistical nightmare, and it would only take one to peep and the whole thing is blown open. Anarchist societies are more resistant to the tampering and sabotage done by superpowers today. Hierarchy presents weakness, a failure point at the top. If the top of the hierarchy is seized, the rest of it crumbles. In a society with the aims of removing hierarchy wherever possible, these exploitable weaknesses disappear. The only way this society could be realistically erased from the outside after it established itself would be through military conquest.

The protests are right to want a much more progressive taxation system like the US does compared to France. I’m not saying that US taxation is perfect. I’m saying that French taxation is way worse because it’s overwhelmingly regressive. That’s a reality ,t3_a67p5f,Anarchism

So, its no socialism, but a free marker economy, which will also have a good percentage of public services for the people. Now, i may seem antirojavan but i am not. I have a problem with anarchists that support Rojava but they throw trash to the bolshevicks, which, at least for me was a more leftist revolution. And about turkey and FSA. Turkey is an USA ally. So, the thing was planed from the start. The choices now are two. Either the rojavan leadership was stupid(i was expecting the afrin since 2016 to happen, and i just used logical conclusions, so there is no way the rojavan leadership did not know.), or they knew what whould happen, but they got payed by US so they are highly profiting from that(which they are, the leadership, not the average fighter).

When civilization collapses there will likely be no opportunity to further progress because all the easy fruits to pick have been gathered. Nature regrows, and surprisingly quickly. While human presence has changed the face of the earth, most of it still isn't pavement and skyscrapers. My country is still covered in forests to a large degree. Climate change will affect those forests and change their makeup, but not remove them. And a collapse of industry wouldn't necessarily mean a complete loss of all the knowledge we've gained since the industrial revolution. The same is true for the fields; crops that can currently be grown might not be so in the future, but other crops will instead. To be clear; I'm not making a value judgement on this. That the human species will survive has absolutely 0 moral bearing on the suffering caused by climate change; honestly I don't think there's any inherent moral reason for the species to survive. And I mean, it's more of a personal opinion, but to me the goal of society is be to learn ever more about the world, and working towards a sort of technological utopia in the ideal sense.

"I see there are already a lot of comments, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to add to this discussion, but here are my thoughts anyways. A few months ago, I was in a similar mental state. I didn't see the point in anything. I was hung up on the ills of capitalism and it's grip on society. A lot of it was because I kept watching YouTube videos about how terrible everything is--I still do watch these videos, but I've become more selective and more conscious on how they affect me. So while I wouldn't discourage you from consuming anti-capitalist content, maybe re-evaluate what media you consume and how much you consume it. Recently, I've been seeking out media and groups that are positive and constructive. I've recently joined the DSA, for instance, and I'm excited to participate and maybe make some real change. And whereas I would spend whole days watching anti-capitalist YouTube videos, I now make sure I throw in some cooking and entertainment videos now and again. It has really helped. Now for some practical/career stuff. Like you, I am also leaving my job. I've been there for two years and it's comfortable (yet boring). I leave in 3 weeks, and I don't have anything lined up. I'm a little scared. I'll probably have to take something that pays less, but my god do I want anything other than this job. Maybe I'll go back into retail, or maybe I'll try out the 'gig economy' or maybe I'll try being a barista. I have a marketing degree, which I now obviously regret a little. While my studies basically trained me to be a swashbuckling capitalist, I do think I'll be able to use some of what I've learned down the road to start a workers co-op. You'd think I would have learned about co-op business models in business classes, but of course business leaders and professors are only interested in traditional models that exploit people for maximum profit. I've had to learn about co-ops on my own. I have a little money I could invest with, so I'm hoping to find 4-5 people who would want to build a co-op with me: a workplace equally owned by workers, regardless of capital investment. Maybe I could interest some future co-workers at my next job. It might not be a radical revolution, but it might provide a slice of socialist heaven for a few people in this fucked up world.

"I'm not making any assumptions. I'm going through a thought process of how different, really complicated things would be managed under anarcho-communism. Phone lines, cell phone towers, the internet, and power aren't going to work just because we want them to work, they need to work because some type of system is in place that builds and maintains them. I'm asking what that system is that keeps them running under Anarcho-communism. We definitely don't have the capability to fully automate all these things any time soon and I'm asking how the people who maintain them will be managing these kinds of operations over giant geographical distances where they would need to coordinate things like this over a huge number of communes. &#x200B; So like back to the bridge example, how would the steel or concrete be allocated from the communes that produce it to the communes that need it? Usually either markets or a command economy would make all these infinite micro-decisions which allocate different types of production to the places that need it the most. A commune that request steel and concrete from other communes might really, really need a bridge, but some other commune needs it even more. How do the communes that produce steel and concrete know which one to send their finite amount of concrete/steel production to? What if the steel producing commune sends thinks they should prioritize sending their steel to one, but the concrete producing commune thinks they should steel to the other, then nobody would be able to build a bridge. &#x200B; It's really a question of coordination. That's still a wide open question about how anarcho-communism would coordinate things like that over very large scales, especially when modern economies and consumer goods have extremely large and complicated supply chains. &#x200B; &#x200B; Like just to build a basic, good, modern rechargable battery, you need parts to build that from all over.

What kind of anarchist supports mass-killings over difference in political views? even anarchists who fought there debunk the 'socialist' stance of rojava. Rojava, never, or very rarely speaks about the class war or internationalis, they are more patriotic than socialists, and also is their war. Really?, I've heard the opposite from everyone fighting there. That they are doing there best to try and set up communal living spaces and socialist policies. >About Marx, i bet my liver you have not yer read any of him(MARX, not about Marx, his books and his ideas), cause Marx never spoke about a centralized state(Marx vision was more about the one you are describing, co ops, locals communitions, a.t.c).

And don't say 'Dictatorship just means rule', he cited Oliver Cromwell and the French safety council under Napoleon as his examples of dictator. >So, if he did not had a centralised state, he would not have an army, nor he would respond quick and efficient to the tsarists, fifth columnists, and foreighn intervision. It's almost like Anarchist Volunteer Militias have been shown to work quite well. Look at Catalonia. The Anarchist Militias took a terrible situation(Generally poorer region of Spain with very little capabilities to produce armaments) And produced an effective militia with much better morale and cohesion than the fascists on the opposing side. Besides, are you forgetting that the Black Army were able to fight against the Tsars quite effectively? >The type of government that you suggest, free working co ops, at the time was PROVEN to be ineffective, multiple times. How so? Was it proven even more ineffective than we now know centralised state socialism is? >Annexations of what? The point is, that my arguements is proven again here.

If your 'ally' betrays you, you dont lick his boots.

Except had they only got Assad on their side, they would have had less time to negotiate from a much weaker position. And since Assad has said on multiple occasions that he's interested in re-uniting Syria, it's kinda in their best interests to not empower him too much, since they want some level of freedom from his regime. Waiting until they had fought ISIS and built a much stronger position before negotiating with Assad was a good call. >The americans gave their leadership money and power, this is why they continiued to lick their boots.

"So you are saying that people will not engage to effectively change their conditions unless they have nothing to loose? :) I think I have heard this argument before. I think it has nothing to do with being indigenous or not, of being of any certain category and characterization, but in every perceived society there are those who need change more urgently than others. Instead of waiting for all of society, or all of the class, or all of the nation, to join 'their movement', their can be something that can be achieved as a group. A group conscious of the necessary steps and repercussions, a group committed to fight for what they believe is justice, instead of waiting for 'everybody'. The stratification of any society is such that there will always be significant parts of the population acting as reactionaries to protect their own interest. This is a huge difference from what the stratification was in industrial societies of the 19th century and in many countries well into the 20th century. Marxists on one hand believe as a revolution to cease control of the state and use it. Anarchists want to destroy the state and force a new condition within the borders and the jurisdiction of that state. Both today seem very unlikely as there will be tremendous resistance from society itself, not just the state apparatus, and therefore not only can not this be perceived as a social revolution but could very well be described as an anti-social revolution and movement. Not because I say so, but because it may be so. New material and social conditions require new tools and we have 'all' become very defensive of our own traditions. In this fashion both marxists and anarchists have has a hard time digesting what has happened in Chiapas. They can't call it a revolution as it doesn't fit their perceptions of what that entails, they can't dismiss it as 'reform', they look down on it as a 'pocket' of liberation, but they generally dismiss it as an approach to change. A change of the daily collective life, outside markets and state control. They can decide on their own what their lives can be like, they can equally participate in the decision process.

"and based on my quick skimming of the nihilism section of the book you mentioned - nihilism does have certain motivations. It rejects meaning and purpose You misunderstand. Anarcho-nihilism is *politically* nihilistic, not *morally* nihilistic. It rejects any and all positive political program, not any and all values. It's argument is essentially 'you're probably going to lose anyways, and even if you win you probably won't get to actually dictate what institutions and norms get set up as a result, so you should just attack things that you hate and try to abolish them by doing so. Someone else will come along and build something else, probably. And, if not, what would you rather be - the person who did nothing and still died eventually anyways, or the person who tried to do something and died in the attempt'? So that would be the main difference I guess. A nihilist may not consider anything good or bad, but a pessimist considers absolutely everything absolutely bad.

When I personally think of propaganda, I think of the USSR, which put lots of effort into propaganda. Much of it was horrible, e.g. the propaganda in Catalonia which undermined the Trotskyists and anarchists with blatant falsehoods. But I can see a more general definition of propaganda, and that allows me to think what matters most is how honest or dishonest the propaganda is, and whether the thing it advocates for (its direction) is good or bad.

Escaping that bubble takes a lot of work and pretty much goes against how you've been educated. Also if we're talking America, Republicans have gotten really good at spreading common-sense conservatism. They're basically arguments that on a surface level are compelling and easily digestible so people who aren't that engaged can easily accept them as truth. Stuff like immigrants steal your jobs, the earth has always warmed and cooled sound very logical if you don't look any deeper. (I'm not great at explaining this, it's laid out well in the book Enlightenment 2.0 ) Also take into consideration that fear primes people to attach to simple, decisive, 'powerful' solutions without critically examining them and this is coupled with huge emphasis on fear in American media (especially post 9/11) (this part about fear is explained well in Assault on Reason by Al Gore, although I don't love the rest of that book) So yea this got super long but basically if you've been raised a certain way and right wing arguments are designed for easy digestion and acceptance, it's kind of understandable (and hard to undo sadly) ",t3_a2dl9n,Anarchism

Furthermore, the United States, unlike European countries, did not persistently and publicly criticize Turkey over allegations of human rights violations. Also, the United States did not pressure Özal on the Kurdish problem, another issue that seemed to preoccupy the Europeans. 1990s Clinton was pouring arms into Turkey for the purpose of carrying out massive, murderous, destructive attacks against the Kurdish population of Turkey in the Southeast 2000s Turkey has fought an insurgent war against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish guerrilla group (recognized as a terrorist organization by both the United States and the European Union) seeking Kurdish independence, in which more than 37,000 people have lost their lives ",t3_a7xrdt,Anarchism

The Ancient Greek word Hellas (Ἑλλάς, Ellás) is the original word for Greece, from which the word Hellenistic was derived.At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, North Africa and Western Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era.

Trump is incredibly similar to the average politician. He's just more vocal about his reactionary opinions.

The organizations fighting alongside the YPG which are Communist have been the TKP-ML, and the MKP(both which are Marxist-Leninist-Maoists) and the MLKP(which are Marxist-Leninist-Hoxhaist).

"He is misdefining socialism. It's a typical critique that right wingers will make that socialism/communism is only the specific historical examples that they pick. 95% of the time this is the USSR, China, and North Korea. Socialism is almost always advocated for in the form of co-operative ownership or collective ownership, not state ownership. The best way to approach this response would be letting this person know that socialism is not collectivism nor is it welfarism. Next, I would recommend that you bring up the fact that social ownership means ownership over the products of ones labor. There is no consensus regarding this. No individual or collective has the capacity within a socialist cooperative to impede upon another's production if they are to be in correspondence with socialist principles. Further, I would recommend you bring up the distinction between personal and private property as it pertains to socialism. Socialism is not the collectivization of all property; only productive resources. This is only the preference of collective bargaining over hierarchical decisions of such which make sacrifice to the capitalist middleman. You could also bring up the fact that redistribution of produce on a collective level is no more inherently authoritative than market determination of labor value because ideally, the system is not filtered by excessive bureaucracy just as to most right wingers, capitalism ideally isn't either. One receives as consequence of valuable contribution just as one may receive currency for what is deemed valuable contribution by the free market in a capitalist system. If one believes that the free market more effectively determines the value of labor, then such is a matter of value theory, not the oppressiveness of social ownership. ",t3_a1z4c5,Anarchism

"Copying some of this from another thread because I think there is a lot of confusion about what the state is according to anarchist theory, and why anarchists oppose the state but DO NOT oppose power. The state is not just 'violent power', therefore, opposing the state does not mean an opposition to taking and using power to achieve anarchist ends. Any political project is always going to be an exercise of power; this is because all politics is about the contestation of the wealth of the world. The bourgeoisie know this; they have no qualms about using power to control all wealth. Marxist-Leninists know this; but their idea of how power should be wrested from the capitalists is flawed and will not result in a better society. Anarchists need to advance their own critique of the state, and their own strategy for contesting power. For anarchists, the state itself is a relation of bourgeois domination that must be dispersed and destroyed. It is incorrect to suggest that state power is a neutral implement to be wielded by whoever can control it. The modern 19th/20th/21st century 'state' is not something that has always existed, but rather, it is a historical formation of class power specific to the bourgeoisie that came into existence for the express purpose of maintaining relationships of domination necessary for global capitalism, and by extension, imperialism. Therefore, if it is 'seized', it can certainly be used to crush the power of the people who formerly controlled it, but as long as it structures human relationships in society, it will not be possible to transform society into one that does not function through relations of domination and submission. Therefore, anarchists do not want to seize and control the state like the MLs, they want to destroy the state. To do so, they need to form their own institutions of power-- general assemblies, workers councils, tenant councils, military brigades, organizations of spycraft and counter intelligence, organized into federations that empower local decision making but can be rapidly coordinated over large areas. A horizontal, decentralized cell network operating alongside a mass movement of workers and neighborhoods organized in general assemblies is the organizational form I am describing. This is not a 'state' because states are historically specific formations of capitalist power, organized specifically for defending the private property of capitalists and advancing their aims.",t3_a7duip,Anarchism

Tensions rose between workers and mine management, and for five days from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers, called the Logan Defenders, who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired and the United States Army intervened by presidential order.

"Right, okay. Rojava, as a whole, is simply naive. And in turn I broadly paint you as a revisionist. Jesus, I swear through some historical mishap the Calvinist torch got carried into the secular world via Marxist-Leninist armchair philosophers, which you honestly seem like. They both identify as orthodox and obsess over dogma. Both think they have special knowledge of how everything works, which they feel no special obligation to explain. If they do explain themselves, they do so in catechistic style, without any intellectual experimentation or personal touch. And both get so self-righteous about their obsession with “the Truth” or their “perfect system” that they stop learning about anything else or thinking about how to meaningfully engage in the real world or with other barely less than like minded individuals. To really drag this out in the most boring way possible, you should really consider not using the copula, meaning any form of ‘to be’ such as am, is, are, was, were, been, etc. Copulas are cheap. Like what I just said. I can connect the concepts of *copula* and *cheap* simply by inserting a copula. I don’t have to explain their connection. I don’t have to discuss real actors or actual situations. I don’t have to articulate an active, descriptive relationship between terms. See how all those last sentences actually fulfilled their own terms, and how I could partially accomplish that by thinking outside the copula?

And I agree with others, this will just increase the number of people who go out and protest today. There's protests everywhere at the moment, even Canada, Greece and the UK (although they're all for different reasons, some that we are against), but it's nice to see the spirit is there. Maybe we could see a real revolution in our lifetimes. Also, whilst this is not primarily an anarchist protest by any means (although we have certainly played a notable part in it), one good thing that's come out of it for us is that many of the right-wingers have been 'red-pilled' on the police through all of this (I hate to use their terminology, but it works here).

"would earlier neanderthal presence negate any human claim over being indigenous That's a good question. In this very strict sense, the only human population that we know to be truly indigenous to their continent are the indigenous Australians, although there may have been migrations and local population displacements within the continent over the course of its history. Every other continent has had multiple waves of migration and settlement from outside. That being said, this is *not* meant to discredit indigenous land clams or validate colonialism in any way. In every case indigenous people around the world have far more valid claims to their ancestral land than the descendants of genocidal invaders and the colonial states they brought with them. I think one of the main differences between European colonialism and human migrations in the past (e.g. the settlement of homo sapiens across Eurasia) is amount of time and the nature of the relationship between the existing population and the newcomers. The European invaders of North America forcibly displaced and wiped-out an entire society will millions of people and hundreds of established permanent urban centers. The Homo Sapiens' settlement of Eurasia however was probably a much slower process that involved much fewer settlers over a much longer period of time, and didn't necessarily involve a forced displacement of the existing Neanderthal and Homo Erectus populations. Rather, the new and old societies probably gradually absorbed each other without anyone necessarily even being aware that a local population change was going on.",t3_a2qjdv,Anarchism

"I think the argument that a post-civ society would be terrible for trans people is based in colonial and (ironically) very transphobic attitudes.

(I don’t refer to them as trans because they were simply considered to be their gender, without any modifier.) To imply that trans people would suffer without western-style civilization and tech devalues those lived experiences. Further, the idea that trans people *need* medicine or surgery to transition or to pass or for whatever reason is bad, bad, bad.",t3_a4mqeg,Anarchism

"No one said that only only homo or bi men enjoy anal penetration. What is bad praxis is a textbook critique of how gender and sexuality is constructed ignores that we live in that construct. You can recognize that many straight men don’t regularly receive anal penetration or they are afraid of it due to homophobia. Also, no one said this proverbial straight man doesn’t enjoy anal. Also, the implication is that they initially enjoy anal stimulation (as a lot of straight men do) but then change their mind because sometimes thats how anal goes. If you want to have a problem with this why not it be that not all men have dicks (she doesnt specify cis men) or that lots of gay men are trash with consent too. ",t3_a7pgcj,Anarchism

"I agree with you, we are on the same page for the most part. I might have gone a bit off-topic, and we are mostly arguing semantics. It's not like this makes much difference in what we should do, after all. In the end it's just a value I put on society myself, and something that I do not wish to see lost by any means possible. I don't disagree that reducing suffering is important, it's just a bit on the side and more implicit in my arguments, you could say. There's just this risk that I can't get out of my head, and it's that intelligent life has this one chance on Earth, and that after it it's gone. The issue isn't that forests won't regrow, it's more that cheap and accessible energy and mineral sources such as coal, iron, and oil won't come back. It's unknown if a civilization would be capable of reaching the same level of development without these things. Or at least, as easily. There's massive amounts of infrastructure involved in keeping us at our current technological level, and sure, some of it isn't necessary or as important, but it's all still part of one big whole. Creating a modern computer from scratch requires immense infrastructure to do everything from mining out the resources, processing them, creating the basic components, putting them together in circuit boards, putting those together, and actually knowing how to do all of this step by step without mistake. Not to mention further infrastructure such as the internet. And none of these parts are easy to do, basically each requires a lifetime of knowledge. And knowledge can quickly be lost if nobody's maintaining it. Books deteriorate, tapes and electronic storage become inaccessible if electronics are lost, and people die with their memories. If the world is in chaos for a few decades, much knowledge can simply.. get lost. It certainly wouldn't be the first time this has happened. And this is what I think is the biggest problem with climate change. If it destroys civilization, there's a significant risk that it will be impossible to get back to our point. And why we should try to maintain some semblance of it. Why it's imperative to solve the problem, rather than saving a small number of individuals. Not to mention the suffering caused by climate change in the first place, but as I said, it's kinda side to the point and not what I'm trying to currently argue. I do not try to marginalize the suffering in the least, I'm just focusing on civilization as a whole a bit here. Obviously that is just as much as a concern.",t3_a375l5,Anarchism

"As darwin, correctly pointed, whe survived cause we were opportunist, and grow from apes for the same reason Have you ever read Darwin?, He argues the polar opposite, that morality originates from us being social animals who need rules to co-operate, and that humans who were better at co-operating survive longer. >The people you are describing, the 'good ones' were and are the exception not the rule. You should know that Really?, Because the vast majority of people I meet are fundementally decent. This may be anecdotal, but I can sincerely not imagine the majority of people being opportunists at heart. >. But wanting to change back to capitalism, is going back egain. You may not know it, but if socialism kills 1 million, capitalism kills 10, in 1 tenth of the time amount. I you go by this logic, you are not anarchist, nor socialist, but just, a fellow traveler. I don't believe people should be coerced in to accepting a system against their will. If they are Borgeoisie and hoarding away wealth, or if fascists are instigating hatred against racial groups, I can understand dealing with them as effectively as possible: But if people want to criticise the regime or ideology in power, they should be free to do so without fear of being sent to political prisons. >And by using this arguement, i can say this. If tourkey is to fight rojava, this will be by the 'will' of the people. If kurds and their majority really like their system, they should be able to repel the turkey backed-rebels Fighting a fascist invasion is not the same as sending peaceful civilians to siberian labour camps. If Rojava was sending people to gulags simply for being critical of Apo, or for being liberals, I would oppose 100%.    Just the tip of the iceberg. You can search it even in wikipedia. But i dont want you to misunderstand me. Makhno, by me, was a good communist. For the record: I dissaprove fully of Makhno's treatment of the Mennonites, and this is making me reconsider my opinion of Makhno. No political ideology should be engaging in slaughter of civilians, no matter how noble said ideology is. >As i said earlyer, people are stupit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They are easily tempted, and, in most cases, most of them did not even know what socialism is, as the first thing that comes in their head is papa josef. I disagree, people understand their conditions. In the case of the USSR, it'd take more gall to criticise Stalin than it would to go along with him. Any free society should allow free criticism of the regime/ideology/leaders(If they have any) >And, in the socialist countryes, people may had been tough, cause of the good ol' americans and their sanctions.

To perhaps with help, by people and maybe even automation, mass produce these devices and distribute accordingly, freely, and cleanly; which by the way I see these types of devices more so currently as a transitional type of help, like more so as a backup for a global society transition to perhaps a 'resource based economy'.",t3_a2fw9c,Anarchism

If you want to go further and say that they have the same level of agency and sentience, and all the complex and critical thought that an average adult human does I feel like you’re going to have to provide some of that evidence that you claim to have. I don’t believe (as a generality) animals ponder the nature of their existence, purpose of reality or life goals. Does that mean they are not entitled to body autonomy? I don’t think so; but that begs the question of if they would even exist if we didn’t intend to violate that autonomy to begin with? There is no arguing that the animals we eat are our slaves, and I don’t think there is really any ethical argument that this is a fair setup, but it is the nature of our society. The reason for this? Meat tastes good. Now, further to your point; I think you are wasting too much mental energy on this fight. I don’t mean to be offensive, but honestly “meat tastes good” is a very powerful argument for a lot of people. Maybe not yourself, but it is a real argument for literal billions of people on the planet. Now, very shortly we are going to be able to “cut the gorgon knot” by being able to offer a completely ethical way to satisfy the “meat tastes good” argument while also respecting the fact that animals do deserve agency, autonomy and respect. In the next 20-30 years you could spent arguing with literal billions of people that “meat tastes good” isn’t a good enough argument, or you could dedicate your efforts to overthrowing the other pervasive institutions that are not set to dissolve as rapidly as that one. The capitalist engine, the looming environmental crisis, indigenous reconciliation, the spread of artificial intelligence, deconstruction of the patriarchy (and other toxic hierarchies), the changing nature of what we currently define as ‘work’ or even the spread of misinformation and thought manipulation.

The only nation that could potentially do this 'standalone' and is still relatively underdeveloped is probably India. I think /u/lightofaten is right that a potentially worldwide revolution has to start from a developed western power.

"Assad's government certainly isn't my preferred system but I have a solidarity towards his government in it's struggle against fascistic elements like the FSA, Turkey, ISIL, and Israel as well as it's struggle against western imperialism. With that being said I can move to the chemical weapons. In 2013 the Syrian Army obtained from rebel groups 2 cannisters of the nerve agent sarin. Later, in 2016, rebel groups *literally admitted* to using illegal weapons following an attack which resulted in symptoms consistent with chlorine gas. Then, in 2018, the Turkish government shelled a Kurdish position which resulted in 6 people choking to death. We *know* that rebel groups have access to the same chemical weapons the Assad government supposedly used. The town Douma, which was were the most recent attacks supposedly by the Assad government occurred, had been controlled by rebels until ~30th of March, the attacks then happened on April 7th **AFTER THE TOWN WAS UNDER ASSAD'S CONTROLL**. It is entirely illogical to attack a town already under your own control especially with an illegal and unethical weapon like chlorine gas.

I view markets as one practical approach to this. There are others but I don't see how value would be exchanged without some of price system. Even among the nomadic Bantu tribes trade was considered essential to survival of their respective societies. I would even go on to speculate that trade (and sex) civilised humankind. Rather than steal and rape actors would approach others on the basis of consent where both actors would benefit. The issue is that if coercive action took place against one of the parties, any subsequent consent given without prior corrective action is complicit in the coercion of the one who has to consent.

"My grandfather was a pretty prolific builder in the area, many of the buildings he worked on between like 1930-80 are still there and in use. He most likely would've used the more traditional stuff. Also judging by the extent of the damage (now that I have pictures), the fire really was slowed down by the bedrooms. When it was called in, there were already flames shooting out of the roof and it took them over half an hour to get it under control. My brother and I's room was almost untouched by the fire, only some damage by the door. Most of the damage there came from the firefighters coming in through the roof and tearing out the wall to get in.

"“Class is a political construct, as well. That doesn't mean it isn't real.” I never once said racism wasn’t real or didn’t need to be dealt with. What I said was it can *only* be used as a tool of class oppression because it was designed for that purpose. “But, the fact that you are offended by a witty jab at privileged white people calling the police on black people for no good reason is problematic. That shit actually happens. Acknowledging it shouldn't make you feel that uncomfortable.” I never said it didn’t happen, and I never said or really even implied that I was offended, because I wasn’t. The statement is factually inaccurate though. Just because police treat the vast majority of black people horribly (again, real problem that has to be dealt with, can’t believe I have to say that) doesn’t mean they don’t treat a huge chunk of the white population similarly. Many, maybe even most, white people do not get “customer service” if they call the police. “People don't like to shame other people unless there is good reason. This is one of the major reasons anarchist organizations have trouble recruiting people of color.” Just want to point out that, after tearing into me, you basically restated my point from the previous post.

"I'm referring more to the default of markets as a natural arbiter. Humans didn't evolve in market-based conditions nor with any concept of legal private property, so the default presupposition that these things are how we should behave now don't have any anthropological or historical basis. Classical economics is heavily based on Enlightenment rationalism, though. The rational actor model is pretty central to classical economics, because the methodological individualism atomizes every decision instead of looking at the gestalt and seeing what is basically a mishmash of cognitive heuristics. It's why the Austrians, and specifically Rothbard and Mises, are typically considered heterodox. They're arguing A + B = C. The problem is that C necessitates that A be correct. So, if you accept the premises that A and B are correct, then you can get to C. But, equally so, recognizing that A and B are false or lack any sort of evidence is sufficient to conclude that C is wrong. ",t3_a7rli1,Anarchism

"A delayed assassination limits scrutiny while a) tying up a loose end, and b) still sending a message to the sufficiently conspiratorially inclined. If you do it when his story is hot it looks extremely suspicious, and besides the CIA still has limits - the could defeat his investigation using the media, but a rushed assassination, or one that inspired investigation, could still lead to exposure. If they assassinate some people, that doesn't mean they'd have to assassinate everybody. Webb perhaps knew more than other critics, and his accusation garnered enough publicity before they were 'refuted' that there would probably be some personal motivation to get him as well. John Kerry is sufficiently establishment that he couldn't be assassinated without major effort and justification. He also seemed to have given up after his report came out, so he was not a threat. Plus, with his membership in skull and bones, his report coming out just a few months too late to influence the 1988 presidential election, and his pathetic concession in 2004, it's plausible he's cut some backroom deal. Bob Parry died relatively young of an obscure cancer; its plausible it wasn't natural. The cabal, whatever it is, is not omnipotent; its likely that the people who ran things in the 80's weren't in the same positions to control things the same way in the 90's. There was a lot of popular outrage for a bit in the mid 90's, so they had to do some investigation, and you can't always tell who's going to do their job honestly. There's also a solid case to be made that the 90's revelations were connected to Clinton's impeachment/knowledge of Mena, so there could well have been deep state factions moving against each other behind the scenes. Most of the investigator general's revelations had already come out, and the new revelations didn't really touch big picture intentions, so him admitting them allowed a certain level of containment of the story, and would have given cover for the guilty to track down other documentation and eliminate it. In all honesty, he probably did do as you suggest, but two shots does seem suspicious, even if the spasm shoots a second shot the first should be expected to throw off its aim, and even a hint of foul play in his death is worthwhile to maintain as a hook for certain people to get into the other, much more corroborated, theories.",t3_a53pbg,Anarchism

"**Liberal democracy** Liberal democracy is a liberal political ideology and a form of government in which representative democracy operates under the principles of classical liberalism. Also called Western democracy, it is characterised by elections between multiple distinct political parties, a separation of powers into different branches of government, the rule of law in everyday life as part of an open society, a market economy with private property, and the equal protection of human rights, civil rights, civil liberties and political freedoms for all people. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a constitution, either formally written or uncodified, to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the social contract. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_9yeklf,Anarchism

All public organisation gets transformed to a system of councils. It is voluntary to be a part of such a council, but every stakeholder in a organisation has a right to take part, using a basic democratic vote. In addition there is a judiciary system, which safeguards a limited number of basic rules, to ensure a long term freedom and that the corporations, councils and other such organisations uphold their treaties. These judges do however have to completely rely on the populace, since they have no executive power. Ownership of property, that produces things gets completely exchanged for property of such organisations, as these new corporations mentioned below.

"'Educate, agitate, organise'? This is something I am already doing as much as I possibly can. I've been spending several hours every day talking to people in my community on the topic of Socialism; I've motivated friends, family and old colleagues to consider unionization and shared resources with them on how to do so and the benefits of a more democratic workplace. My next steps are working to create some kind of weekly event in which people in need can visit a 'free free market' to acquire the things they need without monetary transaction - But having just relocated I need to familiarize myself with the people in my community who can assist in providing the goods such as food crops (I definitely don't have enough land to work with to do much more than share some garden veggies with my neighbors on my own). Despite all of this, I think educating people on ethical consumption, as well as providing information on how they can reduce their impact is important. It is an action that anyway can partake in regardless of their monetary position, or how much time they have (I'm fortunate to have a lot more time to dedicate to the cause than most). Perhaps stickying the list to the front page is a step too far, and on that I can see where you are coming from - But none the less I don't think there is any harm in encouraging people to be more conscientious with where they can spend their money. Not everyone is going to be available to take radical action this very minute - But I believe we should be making the most of people who have a desire to do 'something', even if it's a small of a step as going to the local coop instead of the supermarket. I understand your concerns about people feeling they have 'Done their part' by doing nothing more than changing where they buy their coffee, but you wouldn't make that same argument about recycling in regards to environmentalism, would you? Recycling is not enough - But it's a good thing to encourage none the less. Finally, I guess to summarize my position on this, is that a core part of Anarchism is that the community decides democratically how things should be organized. The fact that an overwhelming number of people here seem to be on board with the 'Coop list'... Well, isn't that Anarchism in action? ",t3_a30etx,Anarchism

We may be responsible for our choices but we're not responsible for the severely limited options we have to choose from, and everyone trying to make the most ethical choices they can, even if it were possible to get everyone to do so (it's not), will still not put a dent in the way society is setup.

">A little perspective and analysis of how change in society happened/happens throughout history. I don't know how valuable that would actually be given that we're at a singularity point with regards of the shaping of history that is basically unprecedented in the scope of human development. As such, historiographic assessments are not going to do us a lot of good. >I disagree with this, because I think it conflates the people that control society (have in interest in the status quo) with the ones that can change it (want to get rid of the same status quo). If that's not what you meant, I apologize. In absolute terms, you are right in that the ultimate power to change society rests in the hands of the many. However in an age where the power of a few can be magnified exponentially through application of resources to negate the power of the many, I don't see what good drawing that distinction makes. Our 'masters of mankind' absolutely have the ability to thwart the efforts of the masses and have had long practice at doing so. Mass movements in recent years that have set records for number of participants have largely failed to achieve their goals because their power was siphoned away by the people that opposed them. For my part, I don't think we can have a meaningful discussion about how to change society until the current one is destroyed. It feels like a group of miners trapped in a mine after discovering a vein of silver arguing about how to divide up the spoils; the discussion is meaningless because, under the current circumstances, there's no way to put any decisions into action and the individuals involved have no real way to influence current circumstances one way or the other.

"You're really reaching on this, and seemingly intentionally misrepresenting what I said. There's a very clear distinction between mimicking the language in a song sung by those of an oppressed group, whose message and music you immensely enjoy and may have saved your life, and the language used by racist old white people to describe those they clearly think are subhuman. Some lyrics are easy to substitute words to match the flow and rhyme, others not so much. I'm not convinced that censoring those lyrics not easily replaced is of any real priority to people concerned with real social justice rather than just being some misplaced puritanism of arm chair intellectuals. If it were such a priority, where are all the remakes of classic hip-hop songs to be more PC? It's great new artists are more prone to avoid the language entirely, but that doesn't disqualify the talent, innovation, and replayability of previous artists anymore than Bakunin's antisemitism disqualifies him from being generously quoted by modern anarchists. I will absolutely defend the notion that we should defend having fun, provided it causes no harm to others. To be cliche, I believe we should arm joy. And part of that joy, I think, is recognizing nuance in life. Explain to me where the harm comes from if I rap with Killer Mike uncensored by myself, knowing with full conviction my beliefs on the malignancy of white supremacy in our culture? And yes I'd prefer to take into consideration the thoughts of others before using language which may be hurtful to them. The same way I wouldn't automatically refer to a trans person as their gender assigned at birth. I presume you feel the same. But please do tell me what is the 'right thing' in your view? What is the right balance between personal autonomy and collective responsibility?

"That's not what the term surplus value usually means. Surplus value usually means the portion of value created by a worker's labor that is robbed by the capitalist. So the concept is subordinate to the larger labor theory of value, because it is the capitalist's portion (profit) of value derived from labor. But I'd agree that with things like monopolies, value can be enforced to be higher than what the labor theory of value predicts. But that's a pretty obscure idea on the radical left since everyone takes proudhon/marxist LTV to be a religion. Political economists that think that don't call that monopoly-derived profit 'surplus value'. Lastly, both surplus value and extra profit made from monopolistic positions of power is different than 'use-value'. Use value is the natural value of a resource before it is transformed by labor. That influences the value of a commodity, but again that is not 'surplus value' because surplus value is specifically theft of value contributed by labor. ",t3_a5ooze,Anarchism

"I believe that there is no such thing as a 'living wage', because wages themselves are an authoritarian concept and authoritarianism will ultimately lead to eco-genocide. Wages are the means capitalists steal your labor, since the only way to really make a profit in a for-profit company is by short changing workers (usually paying them by the hour, and then keeping the work product for themselves, which is usually worth a lot more than an hours labor). As for 'sustainable infrastructure', it's a myth. There is no such thing. Like 'renewable energy', it's an oxymoron. It's an un-economical scam. If you look at something like a wind turbine, it is really a fossil-fuel product. They are mainly constructed from GRP (a petrochemical byproduct) and glass fiber strands (usually made with LNG fossil fuels, or with coal powered electric power). They are uneconomical even when you price them based on the 'fossil-fuel dividend' of the petrodollar. If you imagine building a wind turbine in a post oil-production world, the power needed to built it would be astronomically expensive - a gold-plated item in a primitive world. And so the power it produced would be astronomically expensive, and so on, in a never ending spiral. That's basically the definition of 'uneconomical'. As for solar, the story is even worse. If you imagine yourself living sustainably in an eco-village sometime in the future, with solar panels and wind turbines and organically grown food, ask yourself: *how much of this could I make myself if I couldn't go to the store to buy it?* That's pretty much all that's really sustainable, economically speaking, in a post fossil-fuel world. Bye, bye solar panels, wind generator, batteries, laptop, LED lights, central-heating, the whole thing. We live in an age of two types of climate denial: 1. The Conservatives who for one reason or another support the oil-industry in a propaganda campaign of CC denialism. 2. Liberals who accept CC but propagate the wishful thinking that climate catastrophe is avoidable if everyone changes their lifestyle and adopts green-tech. The world is now in a race to see if the general population can get over those two forms of denialism and come to terms with the fact that the global economy in general is unsustainable by any means whatsoever, or whether humanity will be overtaken by a tipping point in the climate and a  *?*",t3_a60hno,Anarchism

As such, historiographic assessments are not going to do us a lot of good. While it is true that the scope of what needs to be done is unprecedented in history, the means and reason of societal struggle stay, for all sense and purposes, the same. Only do they have much more historical urgency.

"I think you might have misunderstood me a bit, I did a small jump in logic there. I'm not saying that primitive lives have no worth, but the chance of surviving in the long term without technology is 0. When civilization collapses there will likely be no opportunity to further progress because all the easy fruits to pick have been gathered. If our modern civilization collapses there will be no way back. And I mean, it's more of a personal opinion, but to me the goal of society is be to learn ever more about the world, and working towards a sort of technological utopia in the ideal sense. So to me a collapse of civilization would be as good as extinction, not because primitive lives have no value, but because it means the loss of an intelligent society that is capable of sort of 'creating' something more out of our universe. Earth could also exist without an intelligent observer, but then there would be no intelligent observer to truly appreciate Earth in the first place, and further, the universe.

">Have you ever read Darwin?, He argues the polar opposite, that morality originates from us being social animals who need rules to co-operate, and that humans who were better at co-operating survive longer.The morality lasts if it not prevents your, or your family(tribe),prevalence or security. Co-operation does not means non-opportunism. I will set an example for us. We prefer sitting on reddit, and not become revolutionaries(not partial revolutionaries, that in monday are rioting and in saturdays are going clubbing, or saty home jacking off), this, by definitions of wikipedia is called oportunism. Anyway, we disagree, and that effects our beliefes, so not so much point to discuss about the topic above anymore(you cannot convince me, cause from my experience i know otherwise, and you cannot get convinced cause..i dont really know why). Ah wait, a example popped in my head. Take a homeless man who sits outside a supermarket or even a common street. Outside the suppermarket ora street, will, standart, pass more than 1000 people,(1000 being minimum), so, if each one of them throws, not a dollar, not an euro, but just 10 cents. He would make 100 dollars per day, and he would eat for 5 days with these money(five days being minimum). But alas, not only 1000 people pass theough the street, but probably much more, and alas again, a homeless man does not make 100 dollars-euro per day. I see this scen with my own eyes everyday.(if you dont see it you are either blind, or you are living in a high class neighborhood that rich mothafockas live, so then again i get why you chose to support a movement based of the political basis and not the economic). And note this, if you are not poor, cause i am, and first time i had acces to the interner was 3 years ago, because of the said poverty. My childhood did not consisted of video games, but out on the hood with the other poor working class kids in the parks, and schools after they closed.(funny thing, we all hated school when it was open, but once it closed, it became our hangout place) Our only happines was playing cards or playing football all day(not the american, the one that used actual legs), and what i mean to say with that. You may know about poverty, but is never the same as experienced it. So better thing why as an anarchist, also fiercely support socialism, even the statist one. I hate when i have to use quotes of grandpa stalin, but is these words, i think lies the truth(even if he was no good or whatever) read '“It is difficult for me to imagine what 'personal liberty' is enjoyed by an unemployed person, who goes about hungry, and cannot find employment. Real liberty can exist only where exploitation has been abolished, where there is no oppression of some by others, where there is no unemployment and poverty, where a man is not haunted by the fear of being tomorrow deprived of work, of home and of bread. Only in such a society is real, and not paper, personal and every other liberty possible.”' >I don't believe people should be coerced in to accepting a system against their will. If they are Borgeoisie and hoarding away wealth, or if fascists are instigating hatred against racial groups, I can understand dealing with them as effectively as possible: But if people want to criticise the regime or ideology in power, they should be free to do so without fear of being sent to political prisons.Countering socialism, means that you want to go back and become the two things you, yourself described above. If, i, a working class man, want socialism, and you critisze it, you want to change back, AND, bring again capitalists, who will make my life difficult again. So, you are enemy, cause you would not simply critisize if you had a gun instead.(not you personally, a person at this position) >Fighting a fascist invasion is not the same as sending peaceful civilians to siberian labour camps.I agree, i never said it was the same. But if the 'peacefull civilians' want to bring the hostille system again, to fuck with them. >If Rojava was sending people to gulags simply for being critical of Apo, or for being liberals, I would oppose 100%.   I just did a five minute search >For the record: I dissaprove fully of Makhno's treatment of the Mennonites, and this is making me reconsider my opinion of Makhno. No political ideology should be engaging in slaughter of civilians, no matter how noble said ideology is.Like it or not, he was same as bolshevicks, and if you want to call him anarchist,just because he was using the name, then i can call lenin anarchist, too, cause he wanted the same ends as the anarchists. In the end, the thing that is cutting the path to reunification of red and black are the means to achieve the ends. >I disagree, people understand their conditions. In the case of the USSR, it'd take more gall to criticise Stalin than it would to go along with him. Any free society should allow free criticism of the regime/ideology/leaders(If they have any)Who said stalin was a saint? I am talking abou the bolshevicks as a whole, many fought stalin and were bolshevcicks for the said practices of his. But again, i anwser this question better above. >But regardless of why people in a country are suffering, the option should always be available to change back. After all, people have a right to look out for their own interests.Are you a troll? Changing back? No brotha, this for me is not a sollution.

"This is going to be a long reply. My rational behind assuming that a bit of authoritarianism is, if used correctly, very helpful to achieve the things I described is as follows: There are many possible improvements to today's world, a fraction of them gets implemented over time, but it happens slowly. I think that in order to implement an reform, which is helpful to most or even to everyone, it takes a lot of effort, due to communication and convincing, of every person, who can influence the decision. The more people you have, which can directly influence this decision, the higher the required effort to implement and uphold that change. Therefore the personal costs of an helpful reform would be higher, because of this I would expect a society, which is less able to do any kind of projects, which go beyond the immediate neighborhood. These higher costs to change stuff and do stuff, which requires others to cooperate, will probably also make it a lot harder to uphold the very complex modern production of goods. Let's choose the free healthcare example: First all medical goods need to be produced, while antibiotics and other basic medicine can probably be produced lokaly, complex medical machinery requires and international, very complex production network, due to its required ressources and because the process to produce hardware is itself very complicated. Production plants for modern hardware are indeed so hard to make, that in today's world only very few companies manage to do that, since it is so expensive to build and uphold such facilities (we have a similar situation with the production of airplanes). Then you need a lot of hospitals and clinics, with enough staff, to meet the demand and somehow they must be motivated enough to do this work consistently, while not being paid by their patients. This means a society will have to pay for both the staff and the medical equipment. This entire thing is very easy to organise, if you have at some level a organisation, which has the job to ensure that free healthcare is provided. If this organisation has enough executive power to motivate every person in the production and the hospitals to do their part in this system, by enforcing incentives, with a mixture of benefits and sanctions. I honestly don't know how I would be able to organise a free healthcare system, which works as good as the healthcare system I currently enjoy, without any form of authority. Just to clarify, this does not mean, that it is impossible, just that I don't see a satisfying way and that I think due to this rational, that it is in general harder to organise in more decentralised systems, than in more centralised ones. I personally think, that both the personal freedom and the economic well-being, including education, healthcare, security etc. Are important. I think that, if a society is organised in a way which tries to maximize both things you will be left with a trade off between personal freedom and economic well-being. Perfectly designed anarchism is to me an extreme solution at the end of the personal freedom spectrum. I think that most people, myself included would prefer a system witch is more in the middle of this spectrum. I would therefore like to have such a middle ground society, with parallel anarchist societies. I would like both societies to control and help each other, by trading, public exchanges and very easy options to change between both systems. Now about your second point: I think that this cluster of systems which I envision needs to be in a Nash equilibrium, in order to work, as do all stable systems. A Nash equilibrium is a situation where none of the players (people which can make decisions) has an incentive to change its behaviour, as long as none of the other players does. So if it ends up as a situation, where my happy middle ground society, let's call it society P (for Power, since it is a system where to a small extend people and to a larger extend institutions hold power) would greatly benefit from externalising costs to the anarchist societies, let's call them A for anarchism, I would expect them to do so, therefore harming the coexistance. Depending on the exact version of A societies it can however be quite easy to keep such bad incentives from existing. Also I would like to build affection for the A societies into the education system and media, which will increase an emotional investment in the well-being of the A societies and it's people, therefore further reducing incentives to mistreat them. If you could give me a few examples of such externalities, which you fear may be externalised to the A societies, I could give you an better answer. The last two points are very connected, so I will try to answer both at once: I don't have a perfect Idea of how both societies should be bound together, I asked about this in order to know, what kinds of boundaries are possible with A societies. My personal favourite would be a very interconnected relationship. In this relationship both societies would exist within the same state, be brought up in the same schools and during their education they learn about both systems. After they turn eighteen, they will be able to choose their society. For that they should not have to move, but could just move in a neighborhood of the A or P Society, which should be direct neighbors to each other. Also they would have to accept the duties and privileges of their respective system. However they would both use money, either the same currency, or at least an interchangeable one, so that both can participate in largely the same things. There would be anarchist and public corporations, as well as relatively small privat ones, the same goes for all the goodies of a society. This is however only my personal favourite and I am pretty sure that an A society, which is connected in such a way with my P Society would not count as anarchist. Another option would be to have anarchist regions, which function as their completely own units, which do however interact and trade with my P Society. This could either be done directly, or, if direct person to person trade would put a too strong economic strain on the A societies by an syndicalist trade organisation, which takes all the stuff people in the A societies want to sell to people in the P Society and sells them, while simultaneously importing the stuff they want from the P Society, using a wallrasian market. (basically you have all the stuff you want to export and the P Society Corporations have all the stuff you want to import and then you use a normal market mechanic to exchange those goods, this increases the market position of the A societies People and safeguards them from a lot of the price competition they would otherwise have.) What would you want from my society, in order to accept a coexistance, or even better a cooperation with it?",t3_a1zloc,Anarchism

There will likely be backstabbing in any American insurrection—especially in America, where there is no recent history of mass inculcation of class consciousness as there was in Spain. Even if you got enough people to violently overthrow the government, the average American is no anarchist; they're just going to create a new government. Vietnam actually is okay now, but that's 60 years after it got bombed to hell, and after it converted to a quasi-capitalist economy. There's also a huge difference between a war in a foreign country and a war to preserve the system itself. If America needed to win in Vietnam, it could've. It would've been genocide, but it could have been done. Vietnam posed no threat to the US, so that didn't need to happen, from the elite perspective.

"IMO there are clear differences between your example and the hierarchies that we seen in the business world (and frequently in government): * People will listen to a leader in a group project after recognizing that it is in their best interests. It's completely voluntary, and the moment that leader stops making good choices they group can stop listening to them or choose a new leader without repercussion. In the business world, on the other hand, leaders are given power by someone higher up in the hierarchy and face zero repercussions if they make decisions that are not in the best interests of the people they're leading. * In a group project, competence in leadership does not set you apart from the group. You're still a member of that group and get the same grade as everyone else. You still do a lot of the same work that everyone else is doing. If you get rewarded for effective leadership, it is because the other members of the group chose to do so (e.g. by giving you exceptional peer reviews). Leaders in the business world are specifically set apart from the people they're in charge of and they are disproportionately rewarded if their unit/department/franchise is successful.",t3_a6i4td,Anarchism

">First things first. Human is oppurtunistic by nature, and this is all around us. You and me. Is encoded in our DNA for our ultimate survival. I don't see any reason to believe that. Hell, when you see people fighting in large scale armies, when you see people being compassionat to people they've never met before, people going to volunteer in other parts of the world, it kinda strikes me as obvious that humans aren't inherently opportunistic. We are capable of looking at the bigger picture and caring about one another. Hell, Charles Darwin theorised the reason our species survived so long is that we're more co-operative than other species, because we can look past tribalism and opportunism to the greater good of our kin. That doesn't come across as opportunism, that comes across to me as compassion. But even then, I don't believe that's the default mode, simply another way that we can be.

"this is an excellent response and i appreciate it, especially since this important question usually brings about dismissive, moralistic answers. one question i have is what anarchist organizing to actually seize power looks like? i think u point out good pitfalls of ML organizing, but would like to hear more ur perspective on how anarchists challenge and seize power beyond just 'horizontalism' and 'cells'. as far as workerism goes, i think its often misunderstood by everyone. workers were 'valorized' in the 19th and 20th centuries because at that time they had a unique position (physically producing everything in easily organized factory settings) that meant they had a clear path to challenging capitalist power, not because they were seen as especially exploited or anything. its not quite that simple these days since capital has been on an all out offensive the past 50 years and ppl still arent sure how to proceed.

"You're kinda echoing Bookchin's problem with 'lifestyle anarchism' eh? He talks a lot about 'freedom from' individualistic anarchism (him citing Proudhon as an example) , and he doesn't like it, he said it erodes the socialist character of the anarchist movement. But a coop... (the hint is in the name) ... is inherently not an individualistic act. You voluntarily forgo some freedom to join the coop, to build something (hopefully) powerful WITH your cowrkers, so that you can build resources so that you may establish 'freedom with' your comrades. It seems like you're taking too far Bookchin's idea of lifestyle anarchism to include a cooperative workplace in this concept. Going coop at work is 'making the new world in the ashes of the old.' Going coop at work is very socialist. It's not perfect, it's not everything, it's certainly not insurrection, but it's material and it's real, it's not just a feel-good symbol. And the tactic definitely accumulates/scales; that is to say, if more and more people successfully incorporate their workplaces, then potentially federations of those workplaces themselves can become powerful. You seem to be advocating for eating the whole apple in one bite, or not at all. I tend to favor things like creating cooperative workplaces over other kinds of more aspirational/intellectual political work (like hopeless elections, book fairs, conferences, and the like). edit: just read OP, and I am lukewarm to opposed to the idea of us constructing a list of coops so that anarchists can try to funnel all their purchases to those organizations. I'd rather have the list so there are available mentors who can instruct others on how to follow in their footsteps. I feel like shopping at online anarchist coops feels a lot more like lifestyle anarchism than organizing your workplace, but I guess I can see someone's logic if they say that we need customers at the coops or they will fail and new businesses under capitalism especially need some extra love and nurturing at the beginning so.... meh.",t3_a30etx,Anarchism

Or maybe don't even benefit you at all? -'Emotional reward' Maybe... but I don't think everyone strives to get something out of helping people, sometimes its a rational/instinctive opinion where one doesn't think of the reward and simply does it out of love for a person, for example sacrificing self for another- where all you can gain from the action is death however saving one you love. (which one could argue is our animal instinct, to keep our species alive if we value one of us more then ourselves(hope that makes sense)). -Nietzsches cool, but Stirner is cooler. (Especially for an egoist right?) Things which are cool: Hedonism- cool, but it could also go in the category which i disagree with, but I see how an egoist would fall into that. I don't think psychology is as simple to simply restrain it to- 'we are all egoist' . Believing in it is fine, but it sounds to me like you just want an excuse to be either selfish, isolated with special knowledge you believe in like every other religious individual, or maybe just sound cool... probably all in one.

"Yes the bourgeois elements are there just like in every other possible institution, the capitalists will always insert themselves wherever they can. To say schooling as we know it is inherently bad is hyperbole though. There are whole fields dedicated to improving teaching methods and public education is a complex science or even art form. Lets not be anti-intellectual here, the problem isnt the schools inherently its that the good ideas are kept from schools (or just replaced by bad ones) for more political reasons (standardized testing, shitty sex/drug ed, too much focus on being a job/university pipeline, lack of resources, class size/teacher to student interaction which is again lack of resources, shitty incentives for good people to become teachers, etc). Repetition for one is overused and used wrong but in itself is a great teaching tool for some subjects. Basic language (literal meaning of words, functional grammar) for example, and basic arithmetic have to be memorized without fail at some point eventually, no matter how exactly you learn the concepts. The authority criticism here also comes from more of society's problem than the schools: K-12 acts like a glorified babysitter, especially for kids with an absent or abusive home life. For most kids some of the time and certain kids all of the time, the teachers *are* the only authority figure in their lives. As much as I am strictly anti-authoritarian parenting/child raising, kids do have to have *some* amount of telling them what to do or its just chaos. High schools though are waaay too controlling of teens lives and its ridiculous. It also has a lot to do with luck. Some places are drastically better than others and more importantly, some teachers or even just textbooks are way better than others. I for example had a pretty shit school district in a relatively conservative area, but a couple select history classes were extremely productive for me (granted that was partly because I took it on myself to read the whole book outside of class). That alone made huge steps for me becoming the way I am today politically, stuff I likely wouldnt have been exposed to ironically without the 'bourgeois' education system.

Of course, this comes with the offset of letting go some luxuries that come with a good wage, but most of those luxuries are just futile stuff created by capitalism and letting go of them shouldn't be a big deal for an anarchist.

Yes, you see, this is a huge problem. If you're an anarchist, you probably have plenty of personal, anedoctal or academic evidence of this, which makes you think this is an obvious trap. It is a huge trap that is very well built, tho. I know personally some people inside the force, be it by friends or family, even very close family. Some have broken under the pressure and have changed drastically, for worse or for evil, and obviously others were always fascists by nature. Those who changed for worse are people who are now so deep into that hole that they can't get out (coercion in many ways, depression and too much time dedicated to their jobs already) or are naive and still believe that they are capable of doing some good, which only gives them back stress and despair until they become the people who can't get out or are kicked out. Both try their best to obstruct the higher or more active corrupt fascists and abusive corrupts with power trips, but we know how they end up like, broken. Physically or mentally broken. I'd even argue that people are coerced *into* being power trip fascists more often than we'd think they do, instead of all of them being 'madlads' at birth. That game, This Is The Police. It is amazingly real, I know someone in a very similar situation overall. But reality is more complex and crude, and with more shitty people in every way possible, inside and out of the force. Some people complain that the police situation (about what is against them or how they need to work with corruption) is badly portrayed, but nah. Everything is either on point or actually less brutal or frustrating than what is portrayed. The higher ups make a very good game of terrorism and manipulation of the forces to turn them into psychopaths, the crime they create to supply themselves with power is the same crime they send to do a surprise shootout against a PD in the middle of the night. I've had family to go through this more than I'd like and I see the effect that this has over people who are trying their best. For mine and the sake of any person reading this, don't think that I'm saying that you should give cops the benefit of doubt about them being always power trip maniacs. I'm just saying that no one should act preemptively, altho everyone should be as cautious as possible. If you throw everyone in the same shitbag, you just get more people that should be on our side on theirs and alienate people that would otherwise be willing to join the cause.

Hell, when you see people fighting in large scale armies, when you see people being compassionat to people they've never met before, people going to volunteer in other parts of the world, it kinda strikes me as obvious that humans aren't inherently opportunistic. We are capable of looking at the bigger picture and caring about one another. Hell, Charles Darwin theorised the reason our species survived so long is that we're more co-operative than other species, because we can look past tribalism and opportunism to the greater good of our kin. That doesn't come across as opportunism, that comes across to me as compassion. But even then, I don't believe that's the default mode, simply another way that we can be. I don't believe either benevolence or opportunism comes naturally to us, it's simply contingent on what we believe.Its not about what i believe or what you believe, its a proven fact.

I don't believe we should ever look at any stage in history and say 'This is final, you have no right to change this!'. If a certain stage in history is becoming more unbearable than the last, we should always be able to revert, even if that means going back to capitalism.In this, i greatly dissagree with you. Who said socialism is final? Is a step to the future sociaty, that,like all the other steps, it cannot come peacufully. But wanting to change back to capitalism, is going back egain. You may not know it, but if socialism kills 1 million, capitalism kills 10, in 1 tenth of the time amount. I you go by this logic, you are not anarchist, nor socialist, but just, a fellow traveler. And by using this arguement, i can say this. If tourkey is to fight rojava, this will be by the 'will' of the people. If kurds and their majority really like their system, they should be able to repel the turkey backed-rebels. A revolution must defend itself, as soviet union defended itself without external help.(i dont want it to sound like i agree, i said by using your own arguement) Alway you have to know, that even in the worst dictoctorships, their power is a reflect of the people's will. There must be a base of suport, that, among the intelectuall and political sophisticated persons, draws support. The majority of people will always be wachers of an event, not participants, chosing to remain passive.

"You indeed are correct that the Austrian School, von Mises in particular, was an explicit advocate of ahistorical analysis. Thank you for breaking your view down so well. I have always suspected that arguments for less state involvement that started off from people with genuine concern ended up being hijacked by those who sought to protect illegitimately acquired wealth. The tactics even go so far as funding the state itself behind closed doors as the Rockerfellers have done and still do. I have always been aware that the term 'capitalism' was a slur that ended up being adopted. In the adoption however those who were in favour of liberal programs ended up with conservatives in their ranks. I believe this is happening with libertarians and conservatives who like prostitution and smoking pot. Rothbard in his youth (focusing on his good side) when he was still honest used to call this out. I don't know how the critic of the Nazis ended up protecting his enemies' turf. I am still in the search for an economic order that is not coercive from the root and that is self-correcting. I have faith markets and individual sovereignty would be aspects of such a program.

Think of the positive social changes that happened after the  in Britain. So many people died that it caused a labor shortage.

"People already addressed the way in which capitalism makes mental illness worse, so I won't go over that again. First of all, the sort of mental illness that has a high likelihood of actually directly harming others is a very small percentage of all mental illnesses. Most mental illnesses would probably be less present *and* less harmful in a society based on mutual aid. That might sound like a minor point, but it's important to address because of how your question can be framed. By linking mental illness and danger to a community together, you're continuing a narrative that is very harmful to people with mental illness. Now, it's also important to point out that part of what allows people with, let's say, manipulative or harmful traits to do the damage they tend to do is made worse by the presence of authority and hierarchies. The people you are talking about are helped by the systems of capitalism and the state, if they aren't rewarded. The hierarchies inherent in the state and capitalism give these people more tools to exploit. A society where they can't make people materially dependent on them, and that's on the lookout for dominating and hierarchical behavior will give manipulative and harmful people less of a chance to exert power over others. And I think that's an important point: Under capitalism, people willing to hurt and exploit people are rewarded, whereas in a society based on mutual aid, the emphasis is on, well, mutual aid and helping your community. What would stop charismatic people from attaining power in their communities, with the sole intent of exploiting that power? Anarchy isn't a one-shot-and-we're-done sort of thing. It's not just getting rid of hierarchies once. It's being constantly vigilant that new hierarchies aren't popping up. It's a dedication to freedom and liberation of everyone. It's being aware that everything won't just magically work out and that we need to be on the lookout of exactly what you describe. What's are plan for groups like the mafia, too? By making it unnecessary and impossible to exist. The Mafia is allowed to exist because (a) it's profitable and they have a strong incentive to keep existing to make more money and (b) because the main thing that's supposed to prevent them from existing (the state) is equally hierarchical and corrupt. In an anarchist society, one of the main draws of organizations like the Mafia immediately goes away: access to illegal goods and services. If you can then create a community that can stand up against hierarchies, which you automatically do in an anarchist society, you take away the last of the Mafia's power.",t3_a3v74m,Anarchism

They don't pay a fraction of what we pay. That's why France has 50% payroll taxes and the US has 15% payroll taxes. There is a huge tax burden on the French middle class.

"Well, it's not just that the RAM leads to a bad economic model, but, that any explanations for social behaviour based on the RAM are deliberately flawed and consistently provide results that are outliers to the rest of the social sciences. Furthermore, it would contradict the current view of evolutionary biology that the basic unit of selection is the gene. Which is probably why Rothbard himself moved away from the MI. My experience with those who have this POV frame the discussion around capitalism, individualism, private property, and markets as axiomatic defaults of human nature, with socialism needing to justify itself politically. The problem is that these presuppositions have no basis in natural law, whereas socialism (and specifically proto-socialism which would be based on obligatory co-operation and non-zero sum evolutionary strategies to survive and propagate genes) have overwhelming evidence across disciplines. So, here's where the anarchism comes into play, and why people differentiate between anarchists and libertarians. The burden is on authority to justify itself, so if you're making an absolute truth statement about the market as a neutral arbiter of fairness for the divvying up of resources, you need to explain why. Aside from being unfalsifiable by design (making it pseudoscientific by definition), you also need to coerce people into recognizing the authority of the state to protect private property and markets in the first place.

And even if they hate them, they actively participate in creating and maintaining them every day. The whole world is pyramid shaped, and at the top of many of them sit psychopaths. This will never change. The best we can hope for is to strengthen the systems that work to limit the power that individuals can exert when they reach the top. Testing those systems down is, to me, counter productive. The psychopaths will rise back to the top, with even fewer limitations on them.

They've also been known to act unilaterally, taking up resources (like meeting spaces) without approval from general membership. I disagree with this because, at least according to our chapter's bylaws, anything the Steering Committee or the EC do can be vetoed by a direct vote from the membership. Is it completely run on direct democracy? No. But the fact that our representation can be overpowered or vetoed on any given issue seems pretty in line with what anarchists would want (at least for me, as a syndicalist, it does). The political left is facing down a pretty massive barrel, this type of infighting feels like splitting hairs to me. I think, as we go forward, it'd be good to have anarchist analysis to act as a counterweight to centralization of power, but at the moment a lot of LSC membership seems to have an all or nothing mentality, where anything short of a completely heterarchical organization needs to be done away with.

"'Everyone' has forgotten about him. Only a very few people think he was assassinated, and they were generally all already in the conspiracy community so they're just confirming their previous beliefs. Its only that (extremely small!!!) community that would need a message to be sent to it anyways. Tied up loose end as in he can't keep digging, he can't break new stories, he can't be rehabilitated as times/opinions/available information changes. Now we'll have no Gary Webb popping into black lives matter groups, connecting Obama cabinet people like Robert Gates to their actions in the 80's, saying snarky things on twitter about the Opioid epidemic, questioning Russiagate narratives, holding press conferences when Hollywood makes a movie about him... Did Kerry do anything of note about the CIA or drugs in the 90's? That'd be news to me, I'd be interested in a citation for his continued involvement. Assassinating a discredited journalist is a far cry from assassinating a CIA employee. Even just messing with his investigation would have been visible to CIA employees presumably out of the loop or part of separate power blocs, and the Congresspeople who were paying attention at the time. And he didn't confirm everything; he mostly repeated the what had already been documented, and by being so forthcoming about that strengthened the case that there was nothing more to the story. The few mainstream figures who cared were/are satisfied with a 'there was some involvement, but it was incidental and not part of any larger intentional/organized plan.' So long as he stuck with that there'd be little his report would change. What serious consequences did the CIA face for the 1998 report? Anything? No. I don't think Bob Parry was assassinated. I think there is a plausible, if highly unlikely, potential that he was. If the CIA can induce heart attacks, its not impossible to think they could induce pancreatic cancer, and I don't think we have a way of verifying what his actual cancer check-up regimen was. Again, I do not think he was assassinated, I just think that if there's a power that can heavily expand the worst drug epidemic in US history and get away with it (as you seem to agree?), then we ought to at least consider the possibility that those same people can do and get away with other crazy shit.",t3_a53pbg,Anarchism

">I simply think if you believe we are aiming for a classless, stateless society, you can't really expect people to go for that if it's not natural to live without class and state.Human is beyond nature, and, his progression proves it. Humans surpassed their nature when they first started thinking and creating art, writing, language and of course, weapons, states e.t.c. So, i firmly believe, that the natural outcome of humans is to surpass their nature, first against capitalism, and then against authority. Anyways, humans are still evolutioning, so i regard the abolishion of state and capitalism, as a part of human evolution. >Not really, given that any form of land-ownership only originated with agrarian society.Yes. If you readed any marx, you would know that states exist to enforce the will of one class to another. At the start, the life of the humans did not consist of warfare or anything beyond of what animals do. Some of the reason are here(note that the reason are not about ideology or something, but scientifically proven. I, myself, regard ideology and politics science, as i regard them as the natural outcome of the circustances.) First, humans were few, and the rivers that was their source of life in africa was plenty of all. All of their day consisted of one thing for each. Women would protect and rise the kids, and men would go and hount. So, no reason for war, or reason of classes. No time for that shit, or for philoshophy. Man knew two things. Get foud, feed family e.t.c e.t.c. But, the humans grow more in number, so, to avoid conflict,(this is speculated as one of the most possible reasons for imigration from scientist) or other reasons, some humans, started immigrading, so we have people today in the whole world. But then, someone invented the wheel, or a system to grow vegetables, and then the people had time to think, as they did not have to spend all their time in hunting. But wait, who decides who will work and who not? Why not kill the man next door and take his wife as mine? We can say that something like these arose after the human got beyond nature, some people who were naturally smarted than others, or the inventors, created the first class. As we know, a class, to exist, need authority to govern the underclassmen, so, mini states were created. Whar i mean? The chief of the tribe took some men and formed militas, so to protect his tribe from invasion of ther tribes. Oh that great ra, he beated the invaders, it means he comes from heaven e.t.c and we have a deity and religions. But the chief, his soldiers and the inventors did not have time for manual labor, so they forced the underclass to do it, in exchance of their 'services' to the people. Thus, classes were created and the upperclasmen were the state(the state later took a more complete form in mesopotamia, some 7-8,000 years ago). State and authority come naturally, and they will go away, as at some point they will become obsolete. This is one of my theories, that were sure used by different people before. I may be wrong, who knows.....My poitn is that capitalism is a part of human nature and human developnment.(opportunism=capitalism) >Any ideology that defines anyone who doesn't follow it as it's enemy is bound to become dogmatic and oppresive.Then you should know that by your definition of dogmatic and oppresivenes, anarchist fit in these gategories also. Anarchists in ukraine and russia, what i like calling first wave of war anarchism, executed dissidents and political enemies(makhno, Maria Nikiforova) and in spain. Before them, propagada of the deed anarchists killed a high number of people who they deemed enemies of the people. Some innocent got killed in those clashes, as it always happens in war. I suggest read the histry of anarchism in praxis, beyond the theory before suggesting that you can change something without using the two things you wrote above. >I'm hardly a pacifist. I'm simply an anarchist in the truest sense of the word. I believe in human liberty against all oppresive heirarchies, and a state which sentences ordinary people to death for the crime of not accepting it's ideology is an oppresive heirarchy.With that, you cant change a thing. And i doubt you can convince any serius person with this type of arguement. Or at least me. I want to know a road to change if you can tell my any, that does not involve using the things i described above. >Because Rojava hasn't thrown anyone in the Gulags yet, simple as that.This proves you are not serius, juging revolutions from that overall.

"Perhaps say a 'resource based economy'; which all resources are recorded as a survey of whats available and are available to utilize freely while avoiding scarcity to instead focus on ways of creating abundance.

Which is quite the contrary to current society that creates artificial scarcity inherently caused by the monetary and trade beliefs. And as for say community cities or places; such places should be designed to be efficient and modular for ease of construction and deconstruction; such as a circular city design as opposed to the usual convoluted current city designs. Which for efficient reasons would require current cities to be deconstructed and replaced with newer and more efficient designs and technologies.

Especially when we are talking about people on saturday who lost their hands and feets. When we are talking about 4 highschoolers shot in the head, one of them in the testicles, all of them sent in the urgent care departments with very serious, life changing injuries (some of which could have been mortal), when an 80 year old grandma in Marseilles was killed by the police when as she went to close her windows, she got hit by a tear gas canister.

"I think you're confusing/conflating markets with capitalism? I didn't know until I read *Debt* basically that even communist communities have markets. The way technically trained economists use that word (edit: apparently anthropologists agree), there will basically always be a market so long as there are two human beings who exchange stuff. I have nothing invested in this broad understanding/definition of 'market' and I'm too uneducated to recognize the ramifications of accepting this definition over another. I just understand that's apparently what a market is, and it's completely independent from the idea of capitalism *and* markets need not be unfair or oppressive to any market participants. Therefore, if we accept that definition of markets, anarchists even anarcho-communists need not oppose markets per se, indeed, we look like head-in-clouds ignorants when we do, seems to me. Now if we do not accept this definition of market, I would love to know why, with citations :) edit: I'm fine if we want to object to this academic convention. It pisses me off to no end that surpluses created by cooperatives are still technically 'profit' as far an economist is concerned. To me, it's important to reserve a word that means surpluses that are hoarded by shareholders/bosses/owners etc., i.e. profit as I usually understand it, and to keep that word separate from surpluses that are shared equitably/democratically, but the academics in my life tell me that's just not the convention and then ask me 'is that semantic cross the one you want to die on?'",t3_a30etx,Anarchism

"From the way I understand the sometimes fuzzy definition of capitalism there are many different possible forms of capitalism, therefore there are different outcomes. The destruction of our environment is for example a problem of non internalised externalities, most benefit from a healthy nature, but most individuals have options to harm the world in such a way, that they benefit more from harming it, than their own tiny impact reduces their benefits from the environment. Since they only internalise their own harm due to the slightly more damaged environment, not the harm every one else has. A capitalist society can easily use the state to force the individuals to internalise this, possible examples for this are so called pigou taxes, or to create a market for environmental harm, as it is done with CO2 certificates. Of course for this to be effective the negative incentives have to be strong enough. In the case of CO2 certificates I saw a study in one of my lectures, that says that the optimal price, for the economy, for one ton of CO2 in the EU would be between 50 and 700€ (Don't remember the exact level) and at that time the actual price was around 10 or 15 € ",t3_a1rx4y,Anarchism

"Maybe another contentious one. Richard Wagner had some socialist tendencies. Like a lot of artists he's more serious about his art and what politics and society can do for art, his ultimate Good, than about social issues for their own sake. In that way he's very like Wilde. An aesthetic socialist, we might say. Though he has some harsh words for the socialists of his time (or for his interpretation of them), his thoughts about communal life supported by artistic occupation rather than brute toil echo socialist aspirations that permeated his time and ours, reaching back to the viable liberal tradition of thinkers like Humboldt and movements like the Diggers. Wagner was also a revolutionary, albeit one who had to work within the system to get by and produce his art. He was with Bakunin at the Dresden barricades. In his essay 'State and Religion' he writes: &#x200B; >Hence the political movements of that time did not attract my serious attention until they touched the purely social sphere, and thus appeared to offer prospects of the realisation of my ideal premises—prospects which, I admit, for some time occupied my earnest thought. The line my fancy followed was an organisation of public life in common, as also of domestic life, such as must lead of itself to a beauteous fashioning of the human race. The calculations of the newer Socialists therefore lost my sympathy from the moment they seemed to end in systems that took at first the repellent aspect of an organisation of Society for no other purpose by an equally-allotted toil. However, after sharing the horror which this aspect kindled in aesthetically-cultured minds, a deeper glance into the proposed condition of society made me believe I detected something very different from what had hovered before the fancy of those calculating Socialists themselves. **I found to wit that, when equally divided among all, actual** ***labour***\*\*, with its crippling burthen and fatigue, would be downright done away with, leaving nothing in its stead but an\*\* ***occupation***\*\*, which necessarily must assume an artistic character of itself\*\*. A clue to the character of this occupation, as substitute for actual labor, was offered me by Husbandry, among other things; this, when plied by every member of the commonalty, I conceived as partly developed into more productive tillage of the Gardern, partly into joint observances for times and seasons of the day and year, which, looked at closer, would take the character of strengthening exercises, ay, of recreation and festivities. Whilst trying to work out all the bearings of this transformation of one-sided labour, with its castes in town and country, into a more universal occupation lying at the door of every man, I became conscious on the other hand that I was meditating nothing so intensely new, but merely pursuing problems akin to those which so dearly had busied our greatest poets themselves, as we may see in 'Wilhelm Meister's Wanderjahre.' I, too, was therefore picturing to myself a world that I deemed possible, but the purer I imagined it, the more it parted company with the reality of the political tendencies-of-the-day around me; so that I could say to myself, my world will never make its entry until the very moment when the present world has ceased—in other words, where Socialists and Politicians came to end, should *we* commence. &#x200B; You can find an argument for his classification as a socialist here: ",t3_a3e366,Anarchism

"It's sad, I agree. As a white peeps myself I think I have some insight into this. Afaics it's a proportional response to (perceived) POC-petitioning-for-justice fatigue by white liberals. Ironically I think O'Bama may have contributed to this, because white liberal peeps largely let themselves off the hook with their racial guilt after he was elected, but POC on the Left had inflated expectations about what was coming next. When they were disappointed they howled injustice but white peeps shed some of their previous sympathy for their cause. While afaics POC suffer worse now than before OB's election, they have less political capital to complain about it. If this theory is correct, then POC need to be cautious about peddling their cause too hard now, because getting vocal in the Trump era is just fuelling the far-Right, and none of us want to see the 'racism' 'anti-racism' debate settled with Jackboots. One solution seems clear to me. We all have to just fight as 'We, the People', and then everyone can afford to be as vocal as they like (even native Americans, who can easily point out how the document with that phrase steamrollered over them). For now, assuming I haven't inflamed anyone so much with my theorizing that they can't think straight anymore, I would love to hear constructive suggestions on how we can try to spread the idea that, for now, we all need to be strategic, and support 'We, the People' collectively so that we can overthrow the system behind it.

They have also kept close contact with Human-Rights Watch, Amnesty, the UN Human Rights Commision, and frequently offer to improve themselves, and keep within international standards. You can read some of their responses yourself if you wish:   They have also signed the Geneva Call and offered to have officials trained by Western states in terms of human rights. If Rojava were denying atrocities, they would simply dismiss them as propoganda and leave it at that. The fact that they have open communication with Amnesty and Human Rights Watch and actively make an effort to try and be on positive terms with western Human Rights organisations puts them leagues ahead of most militaries. >(In those, you will find that PYD-YPG used torture against political enemies) That's a misrepresentation of what the Human Rights Watch report said. When you read the reports, they state that there are instances of prisoners claiming to have been beaten and mistreated by officials, HOWEVER constitutionally torture is against the law in Rojava. It seems as though this isn't a case of institutionalised torture, in fact torture is constitutionally prohibited. What seems to be the case is that officers are abusing their power on prisoners illegally. Obviously this is a problem, but it's not as though this is an active effort to use torture like with Guantanamo Bay. More that in a war situation sometimes police officers and soldiers abuse their power. >bellow is about class war and socialism That's actually a book review as opposed to an actual critique of Rojava.

"Trump’s policies are only negligibly worse than any American politician’s. No matter who’s in the White House, minorities and LGBTQ+ folks suffer. Even the most substantially progressive president in America will do absolutely nothing to curb abroad oppression in places like Saudi Arabia. Donald Trump’s policies are no more or less destructive than, say, Clinton’s, who voted to invade Iraq and would have bombed the living shit out of the Middle East. To make matters worse, American Liberals would see the world as a Utopia because of President Hillary’s very existence. Meanwhile, cops would still murder black teens and Transgender folks will still face disgusting levels of discrimination, which people wouldn’t really see under a democrat. Thinking that Trump is particularly worse than anyone else is a double-edged sword; if he’s in power, then liberals realize that his election is a systemic problem, not an isolated incident. However, if he’s not, liberals view [insert Not Trump here] as some sort of savior despite him being as bad or worse. I feel like I should have clarified this, but I do NOT believe that Trump alone will bring about the end of the world order. I’m not an idiot.

It's my firm belief that we could organize co-ops and other such entities within this gilded cage without throwing it in their faces and slowly change things.

"*Streets of Rogue* is a game that makes fun of the whole ordeal. Not really pro-anarchy though.

So some kind of dystopian resistance forms and sends people to do missions in every floor for their personal gain while you (the protagonist) get to move from floor to floor from the poorest slums to the richest floors. !>! The way that quasi capitalism works is if you talk on a podium shile wearing a mayor hat you get to be president. Of course how you do it and do you even want to do it is your own choice. You can throw the mayor hat in a pit so no one gets to rule. You can befriend Mayor and ask him to gibe you his hat, you can roofie everyone and just take the hat, you can enslave/arrest him. The possibilites are huge.!The game was not written by anti capitalist. More of a guy that ridiculed everything and even though the end is usually bad, the game is fun and pretty chaotic.

"I agree that its stupid to be so invested in one's system that you can't recognize that they're just tools, but it is still important to discuss the different methods of structuring a society such as the gift economies versus market economies you mention. This is because the anarchic philosophy of 'if this hierarchy can't be justified or made voluntary then it can fuck off' tells us nothing about which structure we actually want to implement and having such a plan is required in order to structure any society. The plan can change, of course, and if people wish to pick and choose how their economy works and they vote for such and implement it then great but we can't just begin the revolution, destroy the unjustifiable hierarchies, and then go 'now what'. There is going to be chaos after the revolution no matter what due to its nature, but we can lessen that chaos and more quickly achieve stability if we have a specific framework in mind, whatever that may be (anarcho-communism, mutualism, etc).

"Human is beyond nature, and, his progression proves it. Humans surpassed their nature when they first started thinking and creating art, writing, language and of course, weapons, states e.t.c. So, i firmly believe, that the natural outcome of humans is to surpass their nature, first against capitalism, and then against authority. Anyways, humans are still evolutioning, so i regard the abolishion of state and capitalism, as a part of human evolution. Humans are inevitably going to be tied down by our worse natures. If we can't convince people to give up capitalism without the threat of death behind us, If we can't convince them a better system is possible, why do you expect threatening them in to a classless, stateless society will work any better? >Yes. If you readed any marx, you would know that states exist to enforce the will of one class to another. I have read Marx(BTW: It was Proudhon who came up with that point originally) And yes, states exist to enforce the will of one class over another. That's the point. We can say that something like these arose after the human got beyond nature, some people who were naturally smarted than others, or the inventors, created the first class. As we know, a class, to exist, need authority to govern the underclassmen, so, mini states were created. Whar i mean? The chief of the tribe took some men and formed militas, so to protect his tribe from invasion of ther tribes. Oh that great ra, he beated the invaders, it means he comes from heaven e.t.c and we have a deity and religions. But the chief, his soldiers and the investors did not have time for manual labor, so they forced the underclass to do it, in exchance of their services to the people. I mean I agree(Besides the poor grammar) that a lot of society was probably originally warlords asserting their will, but where I disagree is that that's because human nature is inherently opportunistic. I don't think people are inherently anything. I believe human nature is malleable and this is demonstrable. Look at how different values can be across different societies, how different political ideologies can arise, ect., I don't think there is a fixed human nature so much as a malleable blob that can simply be shaped by the norms and values society engages in. What I think the real problem here is that accumulation of wealth allows selfish people to come to power. Were we to organise resistance against the sociopathic and the powerful, and make sure no power structures arise by preparing the means to fight against them, we could break the cycle. >Then you should know that be your definition of dogmatic and oppresivenes, anarchist fit in these gategories also. Anarchists in ukraine and russia, what i like calling first wave of war anarchism, executed dissidents and political enemyes(makhno, Maria Nikiforova) and in spain. Before them, propagada of the deed anarchists killed a high number of people who they deemed enemies of the people. Some innocent got killed in those clashes, as it always happens in war. I suggest read for anarchism in praxis, beyond the theory before suggesting that you can change something without using the two things you wrote above. They killed Fascist Sympathisers in Catalonia. People who were genuinely trying to take over Spain and turn it in to a Fascist Dictatorship. That's very different to sending someone to a Gulag because they wrote a letter which criticises Stalin/The Soviet Regime.

Given that Ego came first in 1844, and the Manifesto appears to be an application of the Union of Egoists, driven by the goal of overthrowing the ruling class (how original), yeah it seems to me Stirner had an influence on Marx.

"I had a similar breakdown several years ago. Fortunately I got fired under debatable circumstances so I was eligible for employment insurance. I rode that for a year, and since then I've been on welfare plus occasional under-the-table gigs doing odd jobs for friends. A huge income tax windfall after not filing my taxes for 6 or 7 years was also a huge help (my income has always been so low that I always get refunds when I file my taxes. There's often nothing to report for years on end anyway). I don't know how much this information can help you because my whole life is adapted to subsisting on very low income, plus I never did any post-secondary education so I have no student loan debts. On top of that I live in Canada, so I don't know if social services are as generous where you are as they are here (they're certainly far from generous here too of course, but if you know how to live poor af you can make it work). EDIT: it also helps that many of the people I know are punks and anarchists and people who smell bad, so I never really have to dress nice or look neat for anything, and there's none of that poverty shame because they're all poor too, and there's more mutual-aid and support going around which makes the difficult times a bit easier. *EDIT* EDIT: the  can show you how you can turn your crappy miserable job into actual legit revolutionary praxis!

When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. A chief measure of price inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time.

I'm not a scholar on either of them but Marx seems to double down on the Statism in response to the Anarchists which has been used ever since by authoritarian Communists outside of its context.

It’s such a grossly repeated argument for capitalism. And I’m not sure how capitalism is entirely voluntary considering if I choose not to take part in it, I will die... Also, the logic that Marxism inevitably leads to violent authoritarianism is unfounded. Nothing about socialism requires centralized government or even a state at all. Capitalism on the other hand, cannot even exist without the state. Even though it’s capitalists who seem to hate the government so much. They desperately need it to legitimize and protect their claims to private property. It’s unrestrained capitalism that inevitably leads to fuedalist monarchies by way of land monopolies and resource monopolization. This is evidenced by the manor system that existed in early 19th century America where a very small number of families owned massive quantities of land (made available by the state) and virtually enslaved their tenants while the government essentially looked the other way. When they rose up, the government sent on troops to defend the landlords. This is after we supposedly fought a “revolution” to overthrow our despot rulers. ",t3_a5g2pt,Anarchism

Christian anarchist criticism of state power and violence are important to me on a personal level (even if I'm reluctant to add Christian anarchist as a flair here as I think people would judge me for it even if it's one of the subreddit's own flairs -- besides, it offers little in the way of economic or organizational visions), so Leo Tolstoy's *The Kingdom of God is Within You* is on my to-read list after completing *Anarchism: From Theory to Practice*.

"It does discredit their model but like all economic models, no model is perfect and that is the point of continuing research. I believe it will be improved upon as our understanding improves. However, it is the philosophy I have found to be most practically liberating on a personal and theoretical level. If we rejected every model based on its presuppositions we assume complete understanding and we therefore do not need any models. With socialism, do producers have the choice to associate with other producers they would like to cooperate with? What happens when they would like to produce a product that the cooperative they are working with is not interested in? I find that in practice the answers to these are no leading to coercion ultimately. At the scale our societies are functioning at right now, industrial socialism would be the most likely to take form which leads to unions. Unions without regulation end up coercive in nature. The idea of collective bargaining to balance out capitalist power sounds nice in theory and works in practice when the unions are competitive and the target employees have the freedom to associate with either or none at all. I also cannot accept socialism because the primary basis is the labour theory of value. Which is ultimately false. However, I've found that there are wonderful ideas in Marxism for understanding labour economics and politics. The socialism I hear people advocating these days is just plain utopian. I find that giving freedom to private parties also requires pushing responsibility to them such their failures should stay with them and anyone who associated with them.

"In accordance with the current system, one has to amass money through wage labor to be successful. If one works 'hard' enough—which is to say, to sacrifice a lot of his time, health, and freedom—she could earn enough to even start her own business. However, if the pay is 'good' enough, she could decide to settle with the job that she already has, providing for her needs and wants sufficiently. It is a life where most of her consciousness is spent on working for 8 or so hours a day, a life tunnel-visioned entirely on selling her services and person to a corporation and earning money. Money. Money. I simply do not find meaning in that kind of life, and this is even before I had discovered that there is such a thing called 'anarchism.' In a world where obedience and conformity are virtues, I am too 'stubborn' and 'proud.' It prefers competition over cooperation, declaring that an economy and lifestyle based on 'mutual aid' are unrealistic. People's voices are reduced to a single count of a vote to elect representatives who in turn make their decisions for them. The majority are poor because they are 'lazy,' and the minority deserve the state they are in because they have worked 'hard' for it—in reality, it is only the case because of labor exploitation. The justice system blatantly turns a blind eye for individuals that are 'too big to jail,' and instead judges that stealing a loaf of bread is a more major offense than plunder. Hoarding private property is not being greedy; it is being a business genius. It is a world of grave inequality, preferring to always have the 'right' sets of beliefs and ideologies instead of respecting the uniqueness and the freedom of thought of other people. Somebody convince me that that kind of world is meaningful. Anarchism has changed my life because—to borrow a sentence from the book of cliches—it made me realize who I truly am. I have always thought that there is something rotten in this world, and I am so fucking glad that I am not alone on this one. And as a man that is incapable of 'extreme' direct action, I have and will rely on my writings to give my readers a different, creative, and fresh perspective on what is currently happening. If you would allow me to share, I am currently working on an adventure fiction set in a fantasy world with anarchistic elements. One of its major components is the accurate analogy between the story's antagonists and the current system. Frustrations and brain-wracking aside, I have hopes of at least writing my story's first chapter by the end of the year. But that is beside the point. Based on the current system's standards, I am an 'unsuccessful' man. But if being successful means to be a mindless drone that chases money—a processed paper, a modern slave, ruthless instead of empathetic, and wealthier instead of wiser, then I would rather be unsuccessful.

"Do you have any evidence of this masterminding? I know some people in the film industry, and none of them have ever experienced the sort of micro-managing you speak of. Sure, they have influence. Undeniably. But they're interested in making money. Popular movies make money. They're not as interested in controlling the political narrative. I mean basically every movie that exists is an anti-authoritarian story. So much modern media villainizes corporations. I mean the main bad guy in this movie is KingPin, a mob boss and business owner who is corrupt and rich. If they really controlled these movies to that extent, why would our media be so full of anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist messages? So with that being said, the message was not created by some wealthy corporate executives. It was created by the directors, voice actors, animators, etc. Many of whom are diverse and interesting characters. Look at the people who are voicing all the main characters, especially Miles and his family. They're pretty explicit in the narrative they're pushing. They're left wing urbanites interesting in representation of minority groups in film, especially super hero film. That is the narrative they're pushing.

"**Trotskyism** Trotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by Russian Leon Trotsky. Trotsky identified as an orthodox Marxist and Bolshevik–Leninist. He supported founding a vanguard party of the proletariat, proletarian internationalism and a dictatorship of the proletariat based on working class self-emancipation and mass democracy. Trotskyists are critical of Stalinism as they oppose Joseph Stalin's theory of socialism in one country in favor of Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a30gse,Anarchism

Those who want power, which already by default are sociopaths of some sort, and those that have been brainwashed to look up to the police as heroes who protect the weak.

Eventually, if they do not manage to shake of the years of propaganda, ther good will fades away and they will be used to all the unethical things they impose and turn into another power-seeking abuser of regular people under the guise of duty. While not all cops start of as bastards imo. Policing is inherently oppressive and the people who do so turn into bastards as well.

The forces that shape and change our society are generally well above the purview of anyone reading this. The people that actually do have the power to effect change are not interested in what you or I think or do as long as we don't endanger their control.

"How will things be managed after a revolution? I have no fucking clue. If there is sufficient food, housing, and clothing, the revolution will likely be a success maybe. The whole thing might fall to bits in a few months. It's extremely important to avoid at all costs rebuilding the same structures that the revolution aimed to abolish. All is in vain otherwise! I've noticed two dominant theories of revolution in the literature. The immediate break (instantaneously violently overthrowing the ruling order of society) and the gradual transformation (day to day basis people create and recreate the conditions and types of social relationships and interactions that they would like to see and experience in a post-capitalist word - in the 60s and 70s some groups thought that having massive orgies would end capitalism, but clearly that didn't work, lol! It was a way of drawing new people into the hippie movement though, but not necessarily people dedicated to the cause). In my mind, the first theory is a plunge into a cold and deep lake without practicing how to swim. The other one tests the water and develops the techniques. We should practice anarchism on a day to day basis to see how it works and see if we like the results. That's how we'll figure out how to 'manage' things after revolution. [anarchism is all about overthrowing the manager, am I right?]. It's good to talk to other people about their lives, their experiences, their expectations. This is probably the best thing a person could do. I mean that rationality is the tooth fairy. We cannot expect people to make rational choices even when providing them with sufficient information and we should not base our theories for action on the idea that people will make the right decision when adequately informed. We are impulsive, stubborn, emotional, and a mix of other things.

"**Libertarian socialism** Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects the conception of socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.Libertarian socialism is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism, and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization.It rejects the state itself, and asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils.All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary human relationships through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life. As such, libertarian socialism seeks to distinguish itself from both Leninism/Bolshevism and social democracy.Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism as well as autonomism, Communalism, participism, guild socialism, revolutionary syndicalism, and libertarian Marxist philosophies such as council communism and Luxemburgism as well as some versions of utopian socialism and individualist anarchism. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a5g2pt,Anarchism

Makhno himself said it in platform, his comrades acused him of being that( Maria nikiforova), other influental anarchists condemned him as a bolshevick, like goldman and malatesta, so.........Anyway, what i want t say is that i wont oppose a more realistic revolution, becuse i want to put myself in the shoes of the poor ones. If state socialism will solve the issue, then so be it. I wont oppose them. If you ask me, if i could clip my fingers, and i could chose what system to bring by magic, i would say anarchism without thinking.

"You're right. A typical reading might have understood that I meant 'free for the students', but you're going above and beyond so lets look into those costs. My school charges students a 'materials fee' (I mentioned this in other comments here, but reading comments sucks so I don't blame you for missing it), which is intended to cover the cost of buying textbooks. Instead of buying textbooks, the school pocketed the fee and didn't buy the books. Now, the cost of textbooks necessarily includes a markup. If the company only charged the cost of printing, where would anyone's salary come from? So by printing the books myself, I incurred for the school only the cost of printing without markup, where the school ostensibly charged for the cost of printing plus markup that a textbook company would charge. So in this case the school paid a fraction of the textbook cost, the students paid the purported full cost of the books, and only I came out at a loss, having paid the full price of one textbook (the one I copied) which I was never under any obligation to purpose.

Who is a civilian? Who decides who is a civilian? Anybody who wants to use guns for recreational purposes, Weapons under government control only means that basically only fascists have weapons. Yes but In a anarchist society guns could be owned only by well trained Stable volunteer militias like those in rojava, and Catalonia in the 1930s. And in the current setting that would only lead to a escalation of violence I like shooting. With guns, crossbows, sometimes with a slingshot. I've never shot at a living thing, and I hope I never need to. Some people knit, I like to demolish aluminum cans. And bake.

Anyway, at the time, the fear of internal betrayal, was enormous, and it was like this by the circumnstances of the time. Just do some heavy reading on the subject and you will understand. 7 years ago i said the same thing as you, can my knowledge was this..Goulag, goulag, goulag e.t.c..But for the past years i have readed so much, and i have sit down by myself trying to figure better solutions... and there were none... Communism-anarchism will come naturally once material needs of people are satisfied. Imagine yourself houngry in woring all day, 12 hours and having your kids to fed, and the same kids, from economic depresson, failing to drugs and to gangsterism. You could not care about authority or those, you would see the image of lenin and cry from endorsement (my being funny). Note, 100% socialism never came to practice, as for it to come, there must be no a single capitalist alive. >I mean I agree(Besides the poor grammar) that a lot of society was probably originally warlords asserting their will, but where I disagree is that that's because human nature is inherently opportunistic. I don't think people are inherently anything. I believe human nature is malleable and this is demonstrable. Look at how different values can be across different societies, how different political ideologies can arise, ect., I don't think there is a fixed human nature so much as a malleable blob that can simply be shaped by the norms and values society engages in. What I think the real problem here is that accumulation of wealth allows selfish people to come to power. Were we to organise resistance against the sociopathic and the powerful, and make sure no power structures arise by preparing the means to fight against them, we could break the cycle.Comrade,you maded here a logical fault. But, promise me you will thought about what i write here, and think deep. First things first. Human is oppurtunistic by nature, and this is all around us. You and me. Is encoded in our DNA for our ultimate survival. Love for family, is opportunism, as it haves its roots to tribalism, which itself is opportunism for my family against another. anarchism and communsim our opportunistic, cause they both fight for certain reason against other reason. This is what drives us. Now about the circle of authority, i agree with you, and this is were you fell in my words, and made a logical fault. I will put aside the arguement that anarchist can even gather in the present state and stop the crazy from taking power. You may help youself be reading 'Engels:on authority' (mostly the part about the 'good commisar'). And brother, i will present the arguement bakunin used against marx. Who ensure us that this 'anarchist force' or good commisar, will not become a new stalin or lenin? I will anwser to this suhject if you want me further, cause this subject is something you cant beat my using logic.(i am 100% that what i say will be correct, if you start looking the forest and not the tree) >They killed Fascist Sympathisers in Catalonia. People who were genuinely trying to take over Spain and turn it in to a Fascist Dictatorship. That's very different to sending someone to a Gulag because they wrote a letter which criticises Stalin/The Soviet Regime. If someone's a liberal or critical of the regime in power, they should be free to criticise them or be liberal without being mass-incarcerated.That does not make a doference for me, peole who speak in favor of capitalism are the same enemyes for the list. And, i describe above the soviet critisims thing(i never said soviet is the best example, all i said is i will not condemn a revolution jugded only by that. About makhno, you dont know good history. Makhno killed many bolsheviks(executing them), this is why bolshies losed faith in him. Trotsky one pointed that 'we never kill true anarchists. Only bandinds who pretend to be that.' or something like that. Makhno strained from anarchism, nikiforova condemned him for that, as most anarchist of the time. And the last one. As i said previously, people easily alter their mind, as most are not ideologically firm, so, letting enemies critiseze, will develop in an counterrevolution. Plain stategy and sociaety mechanics of grade school level. EDIT:I consider Makhno one of the best, a man of reason, who understood that you cannot bring anarchism-communism, without using authortiy(essentially, a kind of state)",t3_a7xrdt,Anarchism

"In the manifesto Marx and Engels talks about the proletariat organizing into a class, in other words it realizes that it's real interests are it's class interests. I don't think Stirner would agree that the class party would count as a union of eogists. It is also important to note that the manifesto was not the first work by Marx where he talks about communism. He wrote the economic-philosophical manuscripts in 1844, for example. *What is Property?* by Proudhon came out in 1840, why is he not the father of anarchsim and marxism? Was Blanqui, who started his thinking even earlier, and wrote about a group of people taking over the state through an armed insurrection, also the father of marxism and and anarchism? You all talk about marxists having superiority complexes but at least we don't claim that one german dude who wrote one book somehow came up with the idea of organizing along class lines. >This I find it ironic Stirner, who considered by many to by a father to anarchism, influenced ideas that would look down on his own viewpoint I think seeing him as the father of anarchism is very odd since he was not really an anarchist himself.

For the former, it's really just going to extreme lengths to protect certain preferred institutions and relationships, because they are radical neoliberals rather than consistent anti-authoritarians.

"Well as I said above, the hierarchical basis of capitalism is it's enforcement of private property. Private property is distinct from personal property - personal property is still person's possessions and home, while private property is their ownership of capital - land, factories, landlordism, etc. While the concept of personal property had existed throughout most of human history, private property is a relatively recent development occurring with the advent of modern capitalism. Anarchists believe private property is illegitimate for several reasons, including: 1) unlike a person's belongings, private property must be enforced by the state (or an institution that might as well be the state). One of the primary functions of the state is enforcing property laws. 2) it violates an individual's personal property rights. Anarchists believe a person's home belongs to them, not their landlord. They believe in a system of occupancy of use to determine land ownership. 3) capitalism robs workers of the full value of their labor. While not all socialists subscribe to the Labor Theory of Value, LToV states that the value of a product should be equivalent to the labor required to produce it. However, workers don't receive fulk payment for what they produce, because for their boss to turn a profit, he needs to take a cut. If a workplace was owned jointly by the people who worked there, the workers could both democratically make their own decisions and receive the full value of their labor. 4) accordingly, capitalism rewards what anarchists consider illegitimate sources of income, such as landlordism or capitalist profit. While different schools of anarchist thought vary in their opinion of income, most believe that things like landlordism do not necessarily involve labor, and the individual in question is only making money because of their ownership of capital, which, again, is illegitimate, state-enforced and exploitative. 5) forcing workers to sell their labor is exploitative. I outlined above how workers have the full value of their labor stolen from them, but our society is, when you take a step back and look at it, a distopian nightmare in which people rent themselves for large portions of their day to do useless jobs that benefit them not at all. They only have to work before because... 6) the ruling class owns all the resources, completing the cycle. Because people are rented to provide labor, they have no ownership of the products THEY make. Not only are factories, farms, and often homes controlled by capitalists, but all the products produced by these. In order to but them people need money, and in order to get money people must sell themselves to produce the products for their bosses. Hopefully that was a useful description of the exploitative nature of capitalism and the anarchist position on things. Anarchists believe modern capitalism and the state to be fundamentally destructive and oppressive and beyond reform; they envision a revolution against the ruling class that would create a society of voluntary interact, mutual aid, autonomy and diverse lifestyle choices.",t3_a1zloc,Anarchism

"The difference here being that states like the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are all *colonial* states regardless of whether or not the dominant narrative considers the 'colonial period' to be in the past. I agree Australia is still a colonial state, I am just saying the formal settler-colonial process ended a while ago. The problem with denying the fact that, say, Australia is *still* colonial is that it implies, necessarily, that the colonists won, that the aboriginal people of Australia are only an artifact of the past, and that the descendants of the original European colonists have a legitimate claim to the land now. Again, I never said Australia wasn't colonial. I definitely did not suggest that Aboriginal Australians are an artifact, or that 'the descendants have a legitimate claim to the land now'. At least with an openly colonial state, there's still a colonizer/colonized dynamic: the colonizer readily admits and accepts what he's doing, that is, forcefully forcing indigenous people off of their traditional territories. The states that develop after the initial colonization are still colonial, they have just legitimized their presence on the land. But now we're getting into the problem of misusing the label 'colonist'. In what way is OP forcing indigenous people off their traditional territories? How do you know that they are doing this? That's the problem with saying 'My ancestors were colonists, but I'm not' while still living on the land your ancestors colonized. You've legitimized their colonization and you've legitimized your own claim to the land. But *how* does saying this legitimise the colonisation? You relegate us to a historical time period, and you expect us to stay put there. But we're not artifacts of the past: we're here and we continue to occupy the land we have for centuries. We refuse to give it up. I do not see how this is the case. I would be interested in hearing you elaborate on this point because it's not immediately obvious to me how saying 'my ancestor is a colonist but I'm not' implies that indigenous people are just artifacts or historical remnants or whatever. And what of the other issues I mentioned -- what if the person's ancestor was forcibly moved here by British authorities for stealing bread? What if they arrived from Malta post-WWII as a regular immigrant? What if they came in the 1970s as refugees from Vietnam? Are these people colonists? ",t3_a4qr53,Anarchism

I just don't see anyway of scaling our movement without successfully sourcing material (money if need be) for our movement activities. Im tired of seeing money as immaterial or dirty; I'm done with being impractical. I've become so beyond practical that if your political work doesn't make my life better or easier up front, I can't afford to participate and I've stopped feeling bad about that because I see it as a movement-level strategic error, not my personal failing.

"You missed the before 1770 part, it matters. My point was that you wouldn't find any liberal democracies before lots of places started trying liberal democracy. Revolutions like the Haitian Slave Revolt and the American Revolution inspired other revolutions with the aim of liberal democracy. The people living under monarchies saw liberal democracies not only surviving but thriving and asked themselves why they couldn't have the same. The same thing would very likely happen with a prosperous anarchist society. If one survived long enough to prove itself viable, people around the world would question their own modes of government, causing revolutions across much of the world. Because of this, liberal democracies, fascist dictatorships, and authoritarian communist states all have a vested interest in making sure these experiments in anarchy fail. Anarchists aren't less capable of defending themselves, they are required to defend themselves more often due to the nature of their society in relation to other nations.",t3_a45v3s,Anarchism

It's hard for me to get around the fact that the arguments against non-communist positions in *The Conquest of Bread* rely on misunderstanding or misrepresentation, that the science in *Modern Science and Anarchy* really does border on *scientism*, that Kropotkin engaged in fairly wild hyperbole to distinguish the 'modern anarchism' of his allies from the ideas of prior anarchists and more individualist rivals, etc. In his conflicts with Nettlau and Malatesta, he's simply not as convincing and does, in fact, seem to 'dig in' ideologically, when perhaps more innovative thought was required.

"Read this: *Politics of Piety* by Saba Mahmood the reviews here summarize it well.  tl;dr: listen, learn, create a dialogue. talk about it but add historical and cultural context, frame it within neoliberalism and colonialism. &#x200B; edit: also i'll copy and paste this review from amazon (can't post links from amazon or else this comment won't appear - i think) &#x200B; Radical feminists, of the post-structuralist or deconstructionist blend, have accustomed us to put into question notions that have long been a constitutive part of the liberal/progressive agenda and to critically reexamine well-established categories such as gender, class or race. It should therefore come as no surprise if Saba Mahmood, an anthropologist trained in the intellectual hotbed of UC Berkeley, provides a description of the Muslim world that goes against the grain of conventional wisdom and shatters many certainties held dear by feminists and liberals alike. Mahmood's Politics of Piety is an ethnographic account of the Islamic revival in Egypt, viewed from the perspective of women of different walks of life who regularly attend religious lessons delivered by female preachers in mosques of Cairo. Teachings focus on the study of Islamic scriptures, but also address the social norms, personal orientations and bodily comportments deemed necessary to cultivate a pious and virtuous life. This is the first time in Egyptian history that such a large number of women have mobilized to hold public meetings in mosques to teach each other Islamic doctrine, thereby altering the historically male-centered character of mosques as well as Islamic pedagogy. On the other hand, the women's mosque movement emphasizes conducts and virtues that are traditionally associated with feminine passivity and submissiveness, such as shyness, modesty, perseverance and humility (although these virtues have to be interpreted in an Islamic context). Traditional feminist interpretations would tend to analyze this mosque movement through the normative framework of women's autonomy and emancipation, either to decry its participants' submission to oppressive norms or to detect strategies of resistance and reinterpretation that allow these women to articulate a distinctively female voice and agenda. Both interpretations would miss the point. They posit that women's self-realization and autonomy can only be asserted in opposition to prevailing social norms and institutions, whereas the women described by Mahmood draw their very raison d'etre and sense of identity from their submission to God's commands and their emulation of a virtuous self. To illustrate this point, Mahmood takes the case of the Islamic veil, which has been the object of numerous studies. Although many explanations have been provided for its resurgence in modern Egypt, identifying the veil as a symbol of resistance to the hegemony of Western values or as a convenient device to navigate through urban space, few attention has been devoted to ideas of female modesty or piety as Islamic virtues, although it is in these terms that many women who decide to wear the veil frame their decision. According to their own words, the veil is not something that could be separated from the pious virtues of modesty and submission, as if one could oppose an 'inner' self from its public display. Instead, bodily acts such as wearing the veil or conducting oneself modestly in the presence of men are both a mean for acquiring these virtues and these virtues themselves. The veil in this sense is the expression of the process of both being and becoming a certain kind of a person, and not the manifestation of a preformed self. Mahmood's consideration for her informants' own words and justifications is not motivated by the anthropologist's desire to remain 'true' to her subject: rather, the terms and concepts used by the mosque movement 'talk back' to the analytical tools used in social science and to the presuppositions of the feminist agenda. She concludes by arguing that 'the liberatory goals of feminism should be rethought in light of the fact that the desire for freedom and liberation is a historically situated desire whose motivational force cannot be assumed a priori, but needs to be reconsidered in light of other desires, aspirations, and capacities.'

"It is answered later. But no matter. It doesn't really matter if kamikaze candidates are weeded out early, just so long as they get on the roll. Even if they lose (which at first, they probably will, until people catch on to the game) they still capture some of the vote count, and the proportionality of that count can be used as a gauge (by everyone, but especially the elites) for exactly how pissed off with both parties the electorate is across the board. Since kamikaze candidates are neutral, non-voting and bipartisan, my guess is that both wings will vote for them as a form of nonviolent protest. If they get elected, that's just more gravy and just a hell of a lot more chance for mischief. Our fun, their terror. Oh no, who let the scary clowns in the House! First the Yellow Jackets, now this! The whole world's falling apart! What's the playbook for this scenario! The weak part of the plan is that it needs a large body of grassroots support, but we are hoping that if a few people start the ball rolling, one group acting as kamikaze candidates and the other preparing a viable DD system, people will eventually catch on. At the very least everyone interested should collaborate on ways to spread the word. The great part is that awareness of the plan will probably bubble up from the bottom. So by the time the state and MSM cotton on to what's happening, they might be the last to figure it out. Oh, how glorious it will be if they get it too darn late!

"I've done a bunch of different martial arts: shotokan karate, folkstyle wrestling, a little bit of BJJ, even sumo (not a joke). People have already mentioned the need to defend oneself, but something I find incredibly valuable about martial arts practice is just something that takes me out of my head and puts me into my body, which helps counteract the feeling of isolation and alienation and weakness brought about by everyday life under capitalism. Using my body helps re-set my brain, especially during times where I'm spending a lot of time reading theory or going to organizing meetings and I end up feeling burnt out from thinking too damn much. Not to say you don't think when practicing martial arts, but there's a difference between being mindful and focusing and just being lost in thought. Also, considering how easily fashy elements can instill themselves into martial arts clubs and gun clubs, it's good praxis to try and counteract this either through counter-infiltration or just organizing alternative left-oriented spaces.

"Even country music, the most 'white' thing ever according to popular culture, was co-opted from black musicians. Hank Williams, its so-called father, stated on numerous occasions that he came up with his work by purchasing music from and spending time among black musicians. In the south they used to segregate even the music, and had separate 'white' and 'black' sections in music stores where most white customers only had access to white artists. Hence you'd pick up Hank records not knowing that he was drawing from a decades-old heritage right on the other side of that 'whites only' wall. The downvote ratio on this thread, your comment, mine, really identifies a whole ton of butthurt among the predominantly-white-redditor audience reading this right now. I don't think it's brigaders, I really do think that even white anarchists will immediately knee-jerk over to shock and defensiveness when the root of their white privilege is brought up and questioned as a oppressive system that needs to be destroyed like any other. Whiteness isn't an identity, it's a hierarchy, but it has ingratiated and buried itself so deeply in the white mind that to bring that challenge up is to trigger a self-destruct mechanism. The extremely low tolerance that nearly all white people have to any questioning of this system speaks volumes about how successful the USA has been in instituting a system of Apartheid and in which its beneficiaries are invested, brainwashing them to the extent that they won't even acknowledge its existence.

What do you expect happens when you offer the same nonsense liberals do? They walk into the arms of the right. The right say 'you are a frenchmen, you need to come up for your interests as a frenchmen'. The answer to people wanting to come up for themselves is not saying that they're not allowed to come up for themselves, it's pointing out the idiocies of nationalism, greater good, benefit of the working class, etc... and how they are false individualisms, that they're actually working against themselves. Egoism is the only basis for emancipation against exploitation. Anti-individualism on the other hand, leaves workers vulnerable to social hierarchies and social inequality.

Languages evolve and change and terms that are considered sensitive or insensitive now might not be that way down the line in a general sense, and might not be seen that way now by certain individuals. I'm gay and I'm completely fine with people using the word 'faggot' so long as they're not using it in a negative connotation and it's someone who I've discussed my opinions on the matter with previously. I wouldn't appreciate them using it in public around me because other people might hear it and be offended. Which is a perfectly acceptable reaction and I wouldn't hold it against them. I just don't want words to have power over me in that way and I'm big on a reclamation of words to remove the hate. Think of deplorables and nasty women, both were originally used as insults, but instead taken as a mark of pride. I view slurs in that vein, however the reclamation must be started by someone of the class/race/etc. that the slur is directed against. I don't want a straight person to tell me faggot is unacceptable the same way I don't want them to tell me it's perfectly fine to use. I hope for a time where it either slips from our collective lexicon or else loses it's connotations, but as long as it's around I'd rather try and take the edge away.

"Okay. Modern anarchism/libertarianism (as it was also called until the word was stolen by those on the right that we now call libertarians) began as a predominantly left-wing ideology. Even the so-called right-wing 'extreme' of anarchism (I am not counting ancaps), mutualism, is a very, very left-wing ideology as seen by today's standards, since it rejects private property as legitimate while still embracing a kind of market economy. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who founded mutualism, was the first person (we know of) who called himself an anarchist, but mutualism isn't the largest current of anarchism historically. That honor goes to the socialist anarchist school of thought, the anarcho-communists, syndicalists etc. This might seem contradictory to someone who isn't familiar with how the concept of 'communism' can be defined in different ways. The most common interpretation of the word today is to think of communism as the governing systems of self-proclaimed socialist states like the Soviet Union, China and Cuba. But that is not how the word used to be defined. Very simplified (there are a lot of people who are better at this than me), it goes like this: communism is a stateless (no rulers), classless (no social stratification) society with common ownership of the means of production (no private property). This is the 'end goal' for all socialists. Where we differ is how to reach that goal. Social democrats and democratic socialists believe that the best way is to work through reforms within the existing system, that is, let the working class majority gain control of the state through elections and work towards communism that way, using the state as a tool for change. Those most people now call communists, that is, the revolutionary Marxist socialists (leninists, trotskyists, maoists etc.) doubt that the capitalists and ruling classes would be willing to let the working class change society that dramatically by peaceful means and therefore they think a revolutionary takeover is necessary, establishing what is known as the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' as a kind of transition state between capitalism and communism. That is, they think that by turning the state into a socialist state ruled by the working clas and forcing those who now own the means of production to give them up instantly to the state (which will work as an intermediary for the people, in theory), you will in the end be able to transform society enough that the state will eventually wither away by itself, leaving a communist society behind. For *some reason* (a very hot debate between different socialist schools of thought) these socialist states seem to get stuck at the 'state owns everything and is run by a party elite'-stage of development, which in essence means that they are better described as state-capitalists, since it is still a market economy where the worker is not given the whole value of his labor, nor the control over the means of production he uses to create that value. You still have a class society where a small ruling class controls and owns most things. They're just using a different rhetoric and are openly the same as the government (whereas in liberal democracies the capitalists and the government officials are ostensibly separated, but collaborate through lobbying, legalisation etc. and the difference between the two groups is diminishing for every year in most countries I know of. Instead of Mark Zuckerberg paying off politicians to do what he wants, he is the politician as well). Here, before I describe the anarchist socialist view, I'd like to point out that even though I personally don't think either of these paths are very feasible, I am not saying they can't ever work, just that they thus far have failed, and I'm an anarchist because I still believe in the ideals (freedom, equality) and think that the anarchist approach is the most feasible. Well, we anarchists reject any takeover of the state, through elections or by means of revolution. We know that people in power tend to not be very keen on letting that power go, whatever they were claiming before they got it. Power corrupts, and the state is a tool of power used to enforce authority over someone else. It doesn't matter who's in charge, they will try to consolidate their own power and they will certainly not try to abolish the state once it's in their hands. I don't know if Stalin or Mao started out being honest about wanting communism or if they were power-hungry opportunists to begin with, but they both ended up as genocidal dictators who didn't give a shit about the people. Anarchists, on the other hand, think that the state is a lost cause and that in order to have any chance at getting to communism, we need to abolish the state directly and transfer the control of the means of production, of land, well, of everything, to the people directly. The name 'The Soviet Union' comes from the concept of soviets, or workers' councils, to begin with. That is, local councils where does who actually live and work somewhere are those that control the means of production together (and form a council of representatives that can be revoked at any time for the day-to-day decisions). There were a lot of Soviets popping up during the revolution in Russia, but the bolsheviks would eventually abolish them and instead transfer the power to the state with the argument that it wouldn't be good for the revolution if the worker's were given the control directly. The state needed to organize it first, they said. The people were not ready for communism (and apparently, they never where, as all tries at actual communism that was taking place, such as in Ukraine, were struck down by the red army). Anarchists have often been the first victims of a so-called socialist revolution, and that same thing happened in Russia. When they weren't useful anymore to the bolsheviks, they were disposed of, and anarchists were among the first (if not the first) to criticize the Soviet Union harshly for it turning into a dictatorship. Part of why the red scare and the cold war happened was because a lot of people, economists and politicians alike, thought that the Soviet model was stronger than free-market capitalism. People weren't afraid of the Soviet Union only because it was a terrible dictatorship, but also because they thought that it was a superior alternative in the long run. They saw it as a heresy against the commandment of owning private property, and were extremely afraid that the large majority of people in the west would do the math and realize that most of them would be better off under socialism (in theory, at least). The red scare, cold war and support of fascist and right-wing dictators in other countries were methods used by the American ruling classes in order to keep socialism at bay. In Europe, where the socialist movement was much stronger to begin with, countries worked more with reforms aimed at pacifying the working class, such as collaboration between unions and capitalists, which led to the birth of the mixed-market economies and welfare states here. Sweden is often touted as the socialistic success story, but it has never been socialist, instead the ruling social democrats and the large unions have worked together with the capitalist class to redistribute some of the wealth of the ruling class to the rest of us through collective bargains and high taxes, which in turn made a large portion of the working class well-enough off that they became middle-class and gave rise to the most egalitarian countries in the Western world. Of course, this had backsides. With an increasingly global market, it became less and less profitable to keep production in countries with such high labor costs, and the proletariat were to a large extent outsourced to poorer countries like China, while the gap between poor and rich started to increase again in the West. Technically, we were still getting richer and richer, but the portion for the working and lower middle classes especially got smaller and smaller in comparison, which now has given rise to the return of fascism since people see that their relative prosperity is lower when they compare it with the rich people in their country while the welfare state is less and less effective while costing essentially the same for them. And since the 'socialist' side lost the Cold War and we've become more and more indoctrinated into capitalist worldview, being individualistic, wanting to have a career, consumerism etc., all the while being ruled by Labor parties claiming to be socialists or liberal parties claiming to want a more egalitarian society as well (or in the case of many people who lived on the other side of the Iron Curtain: under state capitalist dictatorships ruled in the name of socialism and communism) socialism is not seen as a viable alternative to capitalism by many people. Instead, they, as many has done before, turn to strong, charismatic leaders that put the blame on 'intellectual elites' and foreigners who give them easy solutions (that doesn't work) and common enemies to unite against.

The second biggest left party is the Greens, not very radical either but it's to the left of Labor. And it does have some radicals trying to change it from within (like Jonathan Sri in Brisbane, David Shoebridge in Sydney, etc). In Victoria a few of the Trotskyists and other leftists got together and created the Victorian Socialists party to contest elections in the state of Victoria. They got a fair bit of attention among radicals and though they didn't win anything this time round they are (as far as I know) hoping to keep pushing ahead and maybe building up for further elections. Other than them there's a bunch of other tiny Trotskyist parties and random Leninists around but they are very small. From memory the only nationwide anarchist group here is the ASF-IWA (local section of the IWA anarcho-syndicalist international). There's also the IWW but like the ASF it's microscopic in size. I get the sense most anarchists here are organised on a very informal, local basis in cities which wouldn't be much help for you. There are environmentalists both within the Greens and without, so it might be worth keeping an eye on the rural and young Greens FB pages for stuff like that. They might have events on that you could go to. If you're in a mining town the CFMMEU would likely have a presence. They are by far the most militant union in Australia and a few of their officials are communists. They're not perfect by any means (like the other major unions they have a key role within the Labor party) but they could be worth looking into, although I'm not sure how you could do that if you don't happen to be working in that field. Uhh, what else... Fair treatment of refugees/asylum seekers is a big focus of the radical left and there's increasing support for them in rural areas (though not everyone involved is radical by any means, they're just humanitarian types, church goers, etc). Check in with Rural Australians for Refugees to see if there's anyone near you sharing an interest, maybe even a local group nearby. Mining towns aren't purely white btw, they attract a lot of different people from around Australia and NZ. Basically working class people of all types go for jobs in the mines, incl indigenous Australians, Maoris, Pacific Islanders, Arabs, etc. These guys aren't really leftists either but you shouldn't be too alone if you aren't white. Will add anything else if I think of anything. Websites to watch incl New Matilda, Overland, Flood Media and Meanjin. Your best bet for daily news is the Guardian or the Fairfax papers the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald. ABC has the best TV news coverage, followed by SBS. Neither are that left wing but the quality is generally good (though budget cuts are making it worse). Also this isn't political but living in a small town can be pretty lonely. I highly recommend joining a sports team if there's one around, it's good fun and you'll make some good friends!

"Anarchist ethics, at least the good kind , is existentialist. Nietzsche, one of the big name philosophers, was considered by Emma Goldman to be an honorary anarchist. Quote 1: 'The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality. Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the weak because he believed in the Uebrmensch. It does not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this vision of the Uebermensch also called for a state of society which will not give birth to a race of weaklings and slaves.' Quote 2: 'I pointed out that Nietzsche was not a social theorist but a poet, a rebel and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was of the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were aristocrats' Both quotes from the : 'I repeat: Anarchy—for me—means: Autocracy of beauty, of genius, of art, and of all those who possess the willful and selective qualities suitable for dominating and that mother nature—justly or unjustly—grants and lavishes so generously on a few, while she denies them to most, as if the latter were her bastard children!'

"As an every day smoker for medical reasons, I can see how people might get addicted to the stuff. I don't have much of a problem quitting personally (I have to every once in awhile to fix my tolerance and help keep it medically viable), but I totally get the draw. For me, it's less that there are withdrawal symptoms and more that suddenly all my pains and aches and IBS issues come back - and that's not something I want to live with, so I keep smoking. I can see how that would become addicting. Overall it's much closer to a caffeine addiction than something like nicotine or alcohol, but I still see the potential for addiction. With psychedelics I'd be quite surprised if you got addicted. I've done them a handful of times and usually I don't feel the desire to use them again until 5 - 6 months after the last time.

They will use anti-depressants as a crutch and/or substitute to finding the root cause of the challenges they are having. Self medicating is no different if not worse, because you are not under the supervision of a medical professional.

"Well, it's a tiered system, so not everyone pays that much. Where I live, labor is *at most* taxed at 50% and we have one of the highest labor costs in the world. Capital gains are barely taxed here (which is a problem) and income through property is also pretty lucrative, regardless of taxes. Taxes are higher than they probably are in the USA, but education up until 12 years old is basically free, from 12 to 18 there's a maximum it can cost (and there's government help if you can't afford that), and the enrollment costs of higher education isn't higher than €1000 per year. And if you can't afford that, enrollment drops to €90 and you get a government scholarship which easily covers your text books, a new laptop, public transport... Health care is also a lot more affordable for pretty much everyone. Visiting a GP costs about €25, but you get most of that back afterwards. If you can't afford those €25 up front, the cost drops to €4. Medication is also cheaper. I recently saw a comparison for a common anti-depressant and in the US it'd cost about $100, whereas here it costs €6 for a month's worth. We also have better labor protections, more affordable public transport, less inequality, free, or close to free, museums, a bigger focus on reintegrative justice, mandatory paid vacation, pregnancy and parenting leave, etc. It's weird to defend any country or government in an anarchist space and that's certainly not my intent.

"1. Bourgeois is not simply employment and placement within a productive system or one's relationship to other people. It is a set of norms and the upholding of norms surrounding private property, class society, and accumulation. Adherence to those norms marks one as bourgeois. As for employment, no doubt a ranch has other employed hands. Building on that, Bundy at no point has an awareness of rejecting private property, the basic injustice of accumulation, or the issues of class society caused by wealth (and capitalism). He is for all of those norms. This man would be fine to have all of this things, and is in fact fighting for them. Rather, he is angry because he needs to pay taxes, and is resentful about property, and why he doesn't have it. This is not laudable, but a joke. 2. Taxes are a potential engine of wealth redistribution and a consistent threat to the upper classes, hence their hatred of taxes. However, other people hate taxes too, but for different reasons: a constant refrain from the petty accumulator is their hatred of taxes, because of 'welfare queens' and 'the undeserving'. Chip Berlet calls this mindset the 'producerism'. Producerism is where there is a 'noble' middle that does actual work, with the top and bottom being either exploitative (elites) or lazy parasites (bottom). Bundy is a producerist, through and through, and the manner and target of his retaliation is the state, who he thinks defends 'elites' and the 'parasites' -- or in this case, the globalist elite and their fiction about 'public land management'. These sorts of complaints are typically oriented around opening up public land to exploitation, which, conveniently, will be used by Bundy/co to make more money. (I should state that taxes are not themselves emancipatory, but in lieu of other options, they do spread wealth in society if ordered properly.)",t3_a2kmuh,Anarchism

"**Romani people** The Romani (also spelled Romany , ), colloquially known as Gypsies or Roma, are an Indo-Aryan, traditionally itinerant ethnic group living mostly in Europe and the Americas and originating from the northern Indian subcontinent, from the Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab regions of modern-day India.Genetic findings appear to confirm that the Romani 'came from a single group that left northwestern India about 1,500 years ago.' Genetic research published in the European Journal of Human Genetics 'revealed that over 70% of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma.' They are a dispersed people, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). The Romani originated in northern India and arrived in Mid-West Asia and Europe around 1,000 years ago. They have been associated with another Indo-Aryan group, the Dom people: the two groups have been said to have separated from each other or, at least, to share a similar history. Specifically, the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the 6th and 11th century.The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity.Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_aa7lus,Anarchism

Mastering their use, however, is simple. The key is this: capitol, the one with an 'o,' is very limited in use. It appears in the term Capitol Hill, and is used to refer to one very particular and famous building, to some other similar buildings, and, occasionally, to a group of buildings that includes those similar buildings. For all other meanings, the word you want is capital. This means that in a state's capital city is a building or group of buildings properly referred to with the word capitol, with an 'o.' In this use capitol is synonymous with statehouse: both refer to the building or group of buildings where a state legislature meets.

"**Recuperation (politics)** Recuperation, in the sociological sense, is the process by which politically radical ideas and images are twisted, co-opted, absorbed, defused, incorporated, annexed and commodified within media culture and bourgeois society, and thus become interpreted through a neutralized, innocuous or more socially conventional perspective. More broadly, it may refer to the cultural appropriation of any subversive works or ideas by mainstream culture. It is the opposite of détournement, in which images and other cultural artifacts are appropriated from mainstream sources and repurposed with radical intentions. The concept in political philosophy of recuperation was first proposed by Pietro Staheli, a Swiss member of the Situationist International, who was serving time in a Thai detention center. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a25i24,Anarchism
"**Libertarian socialism** Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects the conception of socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.Libertarian socialism is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism, and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization.It rejects the state itself, and asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils.All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary human relationships through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life. As such, libertarian socialism seeks to distinguish itself from both Leninism/Bolshevism and social democracy.Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism as well as autonomism, Communalism, participism, guild socialism, revolutionary syndicalism, and libertarian Marxist philosophies such as council communism and Luxemburgism as well as some versions of utopian socialism and individualist anarchism. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a7vskr,Anarchism

"Their works are out of date, no question. There are universal and timeless truths within their works though, and you don't need to know Das Kapital backwards to understand them - wage labour is exploitative, the bourgeois class will always work in their own interests against the proletariat, and that the proletariat must come together as a conscious class to enact revolution and seize the means of production from the bourgeois to create a fair and just society. The anti-idpol views of some leftwingers is based in a lazy reductionism of what the New Left and postmodernist theory has presented to the world in terms of analysing the symptoms and causes of racism, homophobia, sexism etc. Because a general socialist view of those problems is that the causes of bigoted views are rooted in, and exacerbated by the tensions created by capitalism, its easy to wave your hands and go 'well that'll be fixed when we get the unions together and revolt, we won't worry about fighting against that'. Fighting racism, sexism and LGBTIQA+ discrimination is important in raising class consciousness - socialist orgs are succeeding in doing this right now. If we remember that there is a link between capitalism and discrimination, and that tearing down the system is the best chance at addressing these issues of equality. A non-hierarchical system of social organisation would offer the ideal structure to eliminate discrimination based on identity - if you're all economically and socially equal, and free to be who you want, what reason is there to hate? There are quite a lot of leftist columns in papers and essays over the last forty years that deal with socialist and anarchist perspectives of identity politics and how to properly approach the question of fighting discrimination.

I've rarely had an encounter where they'd go 'huh, I guess I'm an anarchist now' but I have noticed liberals I've had a discourse with get more and more left leaning over time. Whether that's a result of a seed I planted or not, I can't say, but it's still cool to see, especially if I have a relationship with the person. I notice most of their arguments are made, whether they recognize it or not, from a place of wanting to maintain their privilege.

">Someone didn't pay attention in class. Just because asymmetrical warfare existed does not mean that the Civil War was an asymmetrical war. Obviously aspects existed, as they do in all wars, but the bulk of the confederates power was in its regulars. Even the US military engages in proactive asymmetrical war, but that doesn't mean it isn't a conventional military. >There will likely be backstabbing in any American insurrection—especially in America, where there is no recent history of mass inculcation of class consciousness as there was in Spain. Even if you got enough people to violently overthrow the government, the average American is no anarchist; they're just going to create a new government. Sure but the subject of the discussion is the effectiveness of the guerrilla unit, not the effect of the political situation on the overall outcome of the war. If an uprising fails because of political reasons, that's not a tactical failure of asymmetrical war fighting. Regardless, I'm not here saying that we need a guerrilla war in the US, quite the contrary, I think it's a fucking terrible idea for the very reasons you listed and I want any possible revolution to be as bloodless as possible. But let's not veer to far away from the original argument here. >There's also a huge difference between a war in a foreign country and a war to preserve the system itself. You're right, in a war to preserve a system itself, there's a much greater risk of the 'defending' power to destroy that system themselves. This idea that if any such a conflict arose in the United States the US military would get drawn in can't be further from the truth. This isn't 1861, there aren't clearly drawn borders and battle lines separating powers. People of all political leanings are spread out and intermingled in all different areas, the only hope the US would have of preserving it's power would come in the form of massive clandestine operations on the scale of which we have never really seen, not dropping JDAMs on suspected fighters' houses. >If America needed to win in Vietnam, it could've. It would've been genocide, but it could have been done. You seem to have a misunderstanding of just how massive the military response to Vietnam was. The response to the Communist presence in Vietnam was absolutely a conventional one. Incomprehensible amounts of ordinance were dropped, military proliferation through out the country was definite, and there absolutely was what some might call small scale genocide. The US didn't play soft in Vietnam, they weren't reserved, it was an absolutely brutal occupation and the fact that we have to discuss this in a thread on an Anarchist sub kind of blows my mind. But regardless, the US had political goals in Vietnam, so no, they could not kill every man, woman, and child without completely destroying any chance of accomplishing those political goals. If you're making the case that a military *can* defeat an insurrection through sheer force, then sure, you would be right, but you'd be making that assertion in a very abstract sense and would be ignoring *why* a military would be fighting an insurrection in the first place.

If you are talking about productive resources then historically you are flat out wrong. Productive resources were taken into private hands using violence, often state violence. For example where I am from in the UK the government used enclosure laws to force people off their land and into the cities so their wealthy capitalist benefactors could take over their land. The private ownership over productive resources is also guaranteed by the force of the state. Your aberrant definition of capitalism as 'voluntary exchanges' also fails to address the effects of capital accumulation, which gives the capitalist enormous power to coerce others.",t3_a5g2pt,Anarchism

So I just see coops the same way I see reformists; good ideas that ultimately leave the rest of us in the dust. Why? because coops is about economic ownership, and not political ownership.

"Foucault is not wrong but this conclusion is partial. You need to be willfully ignorant to think that every teacher is just a Gestapo officer. Elements of pedagogy theory that are more or less amenable to Anarchist thought are not at all rare in teacher-training from bell hooks to Vygotsky, from Paulo Freire, to Ken Robinson. The last real reactionary with deep influence (that I can recall) working in the domain is B.F. Skinner. That is not to say that the socio-political-economic institution of school is a utopian clone of what pedagogy theorists evnision (it's not, often, but it can aspire and draw near to its ideals). However, to paint the entitreity of schooling with a brush as broad as this one is simply not true. In response to 'Discipline and Punish,' Foucault's critics point out that his analysis traps one into an obsessive view of top-down hierarchical power. Foucault nearly submits to the power structure he critiques. His analysis, while accurate, is only part of the picture. Anarchists of all kinds are certainly aware that power is not merely a top-down affair. Please think critically. Analyzing educational practices and institutions cannot rely on a one-factor analysis.

"From Paxton's *anatomy of fascism*' We will need a clear understanding of fascism’s two principal coalition partners, liberals and conservatives. In this book I use liberalism in its original meaning, the meaning in use at the time when fascism rose up against it, rather than the current American usage noted above. European liberals of the early twentieth century were clinging to what had been progressive a century earlier, when the dust was still settling from the French Revolution. Unlike conservatives, they accepted the revolution’s goals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, but they applied them in ways suitable for an educated middle class. Classical liberals interpreted liberty as individual personal freedom, preferring limited constitutional government and a laissez-faire economy to any kind of state intervention, whether mercantilist, as in the early nineteenth century, or socialist, as later on. Equality they understood as opportunity made accessible to talent by education; they accepted inequality of achievement and hence of power and wealth. Fraternity they considered the normal condition of free men (and they tended to regard public affairs as men’s business), and therefore in no need of artificial reinforcement, since economic interests were naturally harmonious and the truth would out in a free marketplace of ideas. This is the sense in which I use the term liberal in this book, and never in its current American meaning of “far Left.' Conservatives wanted order, calm, and the inherited hierarchies of wealth and birth. They shrank both from fascist mass enthusiasm and from the sort of total power fascists grasped for. They wanted obedience and deference, not dangerous popular mobilization, and they wanted to limit the state to the functions of a “night watchman' who would keep order while traditional elites ruled through property, churches, armies, and inherited social influence.",t3_aafwou,Anarchism

And occupy was isolated to the urban politicized working class, while totally failing to branch out from that sphere to connect to racialized and non-politicized people - as in: unions never joined in, students both in uni or college barely joined in in a way that is massive and across the country, occupy also never explicitly said capitalism was at fault, occupiers never dared confront the cops,occupiers never defended their occupations, etc. Occupy was, and ill be mean here, a cross class larpist movement that would never achieve shit. These were very small movements all things considered. These don't have anything similar to what is happening with the yellow vests. ",t3_a67p5f,Anarchism

"OK, this is going to be quite a lengthy response. First off, I define science as the enactment of the principles of epistemology, as applied to the material world. Epistemology has two big problems: the first one is the  have been able to influence the scientific consensus in some cases. In the past, Lysenkoism and 'scientific' racism have impeded research, and produced heaps of pseudoscience. The situation in research labs is also not good. Many scientists face job insecurity, fundings are allotted without the control of scientists themselves, with big, expensive projects starving some fields for decades, lab directors have been known to appropriate the findings of their underlings, sexism is still rampant in many male-dominated fields, etc. But there is no question as to wether science itself needs power structures. It doesn't, and power structures impede the progress of science more than anything else. Horizontal, democratic organizations have been shown to be the single most efficient way of evaluating the merits of claims, and I strongly believe we in science should embrace more horizontal organizations, merely due to the fact it will lead to better and more useful results.

"So, your plan is to go through the existing political system for change? That reformism, not anarchism, no matter how you dress it up. That is your first problem. You're peddling this to the wrong crowd. Try your luck at chapo trap house or with some reformist socialist sub instead. Your next problem is that part of your argument is that 'I have to put forward my idea in these long, convoluted videos for people to understand it, and they are filled with subtleties that only smart people will understand'. So, you are both trying to make it seem like it is put forward in this way because it's very complicated and you are very smart, while the people who don't get it are stupid. This is not the discourse of someone who honestly wants to change the world. This reminds me more of cult leaders who try to gain authority by making stuff needlessly complicated so that others will assume that since they don't understand what's going on, the cult leader must be smarter than them, and therefore, they should listen to the cult leader. That you want me to watch your videos 50 times over just hammers home that point. Are you that bad at being coherent, or do you just want to make use of the fact that if you take part of something long enough, you will often start to like it regardless of its substance? The third problem is that you try to hand-wave the criticism against your use of conspiracy theories and non-coherence as that it was a conscious choice because it's too dangerous if our 'masters' find out how it works too early in the process, and also because the government will be or already is out to get you and you believe that if you are too easy to understand, it will somehow hold up better in court when they try you for... I don't know? Wanting to reform the constitution? I don't think that's a crime. This also enters a weird logical fallacy into your argument: 1. You have to present your revolutionary idea in a 'hard to decipher'-way, so that those in power won't find out before it's too late. Yet you somehow assume that other people will figure it out on their own faster than the government, and that enough people will do so in time for you to implement your plan. 2. You still assume that the government *will* figure it out, understand that you're dangerous and drag you to court, so making it so weird that it can't be used as evidence is your defence when this happens. So, by this logic (furthered by the statements you've made that poeple save your videos locally because you think that it's soon time that the government shut them down) you somehow think that enough people will successfully figure this out on their own (apparently by watching your video 50 times) before the American government (with the largest intelligence resources in the world) does and that by the time the government do figure it out, they will arrest you, but they won't have time to stop the plan? And the plan succeeding will not save you from prison, but formulating it in an incomprehensible way will? To summarize: 1. The plan will work if enough people understand it and agree to it. 2. Time is nigh, because the world is on the brink of collapse, so we need to get the information out fast. Unfortunately, the plan is a bit complicated, so it can be difficult to understand. 3. Also, this must happen before the government figure the plan out. Thus, it's full of gobbledygook to make them dismiss it as nothing to worry about. This makes it even harder to understand for the rest of us as well, but you're still confident that we can do it in time before the world goes to shit. 3. At the same time, you are sure that they are onto you and that your videos will be taken down soon, which implies that the time for us to figure your plan out is running short. Thus far, you have 200 views on your video. I assume that isn't enough people to legally change the US Constitution. 4. But you knew of this plan 9 months ago, at the latest (when you posted your first video in the series)! You have had a long time to realize that your approach isn't working. Where were you nine months ago when you tried to spread your ideas? Not here at least. If time is of the essence, why have your sense of emergency only kicked in now? Why is there nothing even remotely related to you and your Sirius Institute on the internet that you haven't posted yourself? Did you hope that your fellow anarchists would find you by chance? We're not that many you know? This seems like a big flaw that you should've been able to discern much earlier in the process. Your fourth, and maybe biggest problem, is that you sound like someone pretending to be an anarchist. You use the V for Vendetta mask, like 4chan and anonymous (and the ancaps). You follow ancaps on twitter. You're into bitcoin and Qanon. You seemingly have no idea of anarchism's history as a part of the socialist worker's movement. How can anyone see you as a sincere anarchist when your idea of what anarchism is seemingly comes from a comic book, a right wing troll forum and ancaps? Yet you come barging in here claiming you know the way to paradise (which, I should note, for the majority of anarchists, may be described as a communist federation of communes and voluntary association) and just expect us to buy what you sell outright? I mean, come on. You're trying the 'charismatic enlightened and unquestioned leader'-approach toward the people who are historically the most suspicious of charismatic leaders claiming to fight for their interests. It's obvious that you're not state sting operation, because the state does better research than this. You are much more likely to be some sort of scammer or just a confused conspiracy theorists who recently got into libertarianism and now thinks he can save us all. I mean, the fact that you try to contrast your videos, that you claim are blueprint for a peaceful revolution, with 'The Anarchist's Cookbook' of all things, as if the cookbook was some kind of essential literature on anarchist thought, show that you do not know what you're talking about it. The Anarchist Cookbook was just a haphazard collection of a lot of methods on how to do stuff the government and large corporations didn't really want people to do (like LSD and bombs), published by a guy who protested against the Vietnam War. Some (most?) of it didn't even work as intended. It had almost nothing to do with anarchism then, and even less now. It was never a cookbook for an anarchist revolution, or a manifesto or anything like that. But it is usually the first book that comes to mind when people who aren't anarchists try to think of anarchist books. I propose you read up on what anarchism actually is and after that (If you still believe in your idea) decide whether or not we are your customers after all (hint: we're not). ",t3_a87v3i,Anarchism

"You responded to your own comment, so you might not get the attention of /u/GreasyAssMechanic but I happened to hit your comment by happen chance, so I'll go ahead and address it. First, your comment about the Bundys having an immense amount of privlidge is valid, however, Also, they've lost horribly -- the guns didn't help -- their campaign goals all went down in flames. The argument being made isn't that you automatically achieve all of your goals when you bring a gun to a protest, its that a group of armed, peaceful protesters prevents lethal/less-lethal retaliation. The Bundy protests were capable of destroying a large amount of capital by blocking traffic on a major thoroughfare for hours, and they were able to do this on their own terms: The police found themselves unable to simply gas the protesters or pepper them with rubber bullets because doing so could spark a fire fight. Further, in destroying this capital, and wresting the power to set the terms of the engagement from the police, they managed to achieve their short term goals: BLM halted the seizure of Bundy cattle in order to get the protesters to stand down. Had tear gas or rubber bullets been an option, this would not have happened. The protesters would have been forcibly dispersed. On the other hand, imagining what could have been, I'm not sure what would have been achieved for the Bundys by getting tear gassed and allowing the BLM to seize millions of dollars in property. It seems like the outcome would have been exactly the same, except that the Bundys would have been out millions of dollars of cattle, and less capital would have been destroyed as the police would have been able to clear the protesters in a timely fashion. Again, this isn't to say that peaceful, armed protests are a magic panacea. If your identity is associated with millions in owed back taxes you are eventually gonna get got. However, the protest *did* achieve its immediate goal, and they were not mowed down in the process. The other thing is, the Bundys are a high profile example, but really there are countless examples of armed protesters not being met with lethal or less-lethal force. This is a pretty common protest tactic on the right, and its used on the left as well from time to time. It might be more useful to, instead, ask if we can think of any examples relevant to contemporary class struggle in the US where armed peaceful protesters were met with lethal/less-lethal force. I can't really think of any, which, considering how common this form of protest is, leads me to believe that peaceful armed protests are successful in preventing escalation of police force. But feeding kids breakfast -- and related social programs -- was infinitely more important to their effectiveness It's not particularly useful here to rank these tactics against each other, as they combine synergistically. Without communization of spaces, its not possible to develop a broader movement, build a sense of community, or address the material deficits of a community. Without armed protest and armed patrols its not possible to address the terrorization of black communities which was so common in the 70s and 80s, and which ultimately poses a threat to the aforementioned communization projects. This doesn't just extend to communization, other forms of protest synergize with armed peaceful protest as well. Protesters engaging in property destruction, or using less-lethal force (e.g. throwing rocks at cops) are going to be placed in a better position if there are 50 visibly armed demonstrators standing by, because it means that the police can't safely resort to their routine tactics in dispersing protests. In fact, it puts those protesters in an upper handed position, as they are capable of pushing police lines back by throwing rocks, etc... but the police stand to lose much by retaliating. The result is that more ground can be taken, more capital can be destroyed, and a stateless ethic can be more thoroughly developed.",t3_a3mms7,Anarchism
">Marx has simply never argued for this type of organisation. What do you make of what he says about the relation between communists and the party in the manfiesto, or how the communist leauge and first international were organized? >Luxembourg and Pannekoek, both Marxists, criticised Lenin’s view and the way the bolsheviks operated, pointing out how it takes away control from the workers. Pannekoek never criticized Lenin from what I remember before the great war, when he was still an 'orthodox marxist'. Rosa Luxemburg actually criticized him for the opposite reasons. In *Organizational Questions of the Russian Social Democracy* she is openly doubtful of the possibility of building a unified party in Russia because of her distrust of the maturity of the working-class in Russia, she writes this, >The indispensable conditions for the realization of Social Democratic centralism are: >1) The existence of a large contingent of workers educated in the class struggle. >2) The possibility for the workers to develop their own political activity through direct influence on public life, in a party press, and public congresses, etc. >These conditions are not yet fully formed in Russia. In the next paragraph she openly says that Lenin trusts the workers to be able to do party work(in the book she is criticizing Lenin basically draws a parallel between the advanced cooperation in the factory and that of the party), and thinks Lenin is putting down intellectuals too much while falsely believing that the working-class has already matured enough, >With these conclusions, Lenin disagrees violently. He is convinced that all the conditions necessary for the formation of a powerful and centralized party already exist in Russia. He declares that, “it is no longer the proletarians but certain intellecutuals in our party who need to be educated in the matters of organization and discipline,” (page 145). He glorifies the educative influence of the factory, which, he says, accustoms the proletariat to “discipline and organization,” (page 147).",t3_a76hdy,Anarchism

As a project for university we were assigned to make film manifestos for a microcinema class. Microcinema is about using very cheap ways to film. Such as using a cell phone or crappy cam coder instead of relying on expensive equipment. The main talking points of this is that trends kill individual creativity. Many people hop on a bandwagon creating the same thing and nothing innovative is made in the creative field. We shouldn't rely on others ideas when creating something and that we shouldn't be restricted to social norms because they too restrict our individual creativity. All this is possible with only using what you have around you. No need for HD cameras or a whole production crew. You just need yourself and a phone.

"I think its a mixture of several issues. First being the extreme global pro-capitalist propaganda which is probably more efficient than ever before. Giving that MK-Ultra is a thing it might even be brainwashing. Most of the right-wingers actually know what communism is or in some cases are rich enough to actively benefit from it. Second. There are a lot of workers who know what communism is but see it as utopian and refuse to believe it could ever work. This party goes back to propaganda and mostly to just broken spirits. Third. This is partly on us. The fascists have always understood the masses and were able to communicate with them more efficiently. Note how there arent any real books in fascism. (Please correct me if I am wrong). There are however talented orators who give the people the impression that they are the voice of the masses. For example right. Lets say you are a white coal-miner about to or have lost your job. You know deep down inside you that you have been shafted. That you have been wronged and robbed. And then you find yourself at a rally. And the speaker says: You have been taken from and used. And you agree. They are responsible. And ou agree that there is a they. And then they name the They. Latinos, liberals, gays, atheists, you name it. The power of suggestion is so strong you end up believing you always felt this way. Contrast this to the left. We have books, and litterature, and a whole slew of marxist terminology. And then we make new terminology and we describe every single way that humanity is opressed in countless essays. And then we huddle amongst eachother and talk about it. The left especially in america has completely lost sight of what working people feel or need. Of what they want. And they lost the ability to communicate the ideas to your average person. Something that came so natural 100 years ago. Meanwhile fascists can stand on a podium and yell out: 'The mexicans did this' and get an audience. Especially if you know anyone thaz actually lost a job to an immigrant... its powerful rhetoric. Look at the effect that Bernie had by simply standing up and telling working people how it is. Imagine if he were an anarchist? So I dont think right wingers are stupid.

I take Anarcho-Syndicalism to be radical trade unionism. Whereas the society on Anarres strikes me as Anarcho-Communist Pretty much what I said; their primary level of social organization is built around specific types of work. The situation on Annares is what I think is basically the end point of an anarchist syndicalism. It's very Marxist, maybe, in the way that even as we abolish things like property and currency and class, we will never get rid of *productive forces* that drive us to do things. On Annares, because of their circumstances, work was very important, so it's not really surprising that social organs would congeal around different types of work.

"Whoa now comrade! Everyone feels it. The time is ripe. These times come around periodically, and up until now, every time they've come around, everyone blows it. Same ol', same ol'. Now is a time of great opportunity, make no mistake. But at no other time in revolutionary history have the consequences of failure been so high - epochal, even. So this time, let's not squander the opportunity, since it might be the last. The consequences of blowing it doing the same old routine have never been higher. So let's think carefully how to make this time different. This might just be THE BIG ONE. Afaics, there is only one significant game-changer in this tired old cycle of revolution and defeat for Anarchism: *the tech revolution*. There are more cellphones in America now than there are people, but at the moment everyone is just using their phones to drool over #GiletsJaunes and #Storm rebellion-porn. Our Arabic brothers and sisters put their phones to better use during the Arab Spring, and showed that the oppressors are clueless about the revolutionary potential of the web, and tech in general, once they are harnessed and weaponized for social revolution. But the extraordinary power of the new weapon took the Arab revolutionaries by surprise, and they were gaslit by how quickly and easily a mass uprising could be achieved using social media. The new superweapon worked so well, and took them so by surprise, that when the dominoes fell like rotten trees, they had no follow-up plan and nowhere to go next. Militarist fascists and religions fundamentalists quickly moved to fill the vacuum. So the Arab Spring was a failure. We must not let that happen in America. Too much is at stake this time. We might never get another chance like this again. It's not hyperbole to say that the fate of the species might be riding on how the rebellion plays out in America now. So the lesson is: 1. In principle, today, a social-media driven rebellion is reasonably easy once the public's mojo starts rising. 2. There needs to be a bipartisan, universally agreed plan on what happens after a successful revolution, before everyone loses their minds in a riot. We have suggested a plan that seems to make sense (at least to us) in the video below, but so far have not been able to drum up much interest in it. See what you think.

"About the 2nd paragraph, what you say is true, but in my experience the problem is that a lot of people are blind and they don't see that fascism is strong at the moment. They think we're fighting against nothing, or something imaginary (or even worse, innocent people). So from that perspective they see us as the bad guys. I think to change that what we have to do is prove to people that Tommy Robinson + friends ARE fascists, that they're not innocent, and that they are a real threat. Totally agree with your 3rd paragraph btw. Especially the nation state part, the biggest problem with these fascists is that they see their nation as their own property. It belongs to them, not to other people. They think it belongs to them, in the same way that they think a car belongs to them. They think they should be at the steering wheel, take it anywhere they want, add/subtract any parts they want, prevent strangers from coming in the car without permission, refuse to let anybody else tell them how to drive their own car, etc. That's how they all see their nations. Their idea of fun is to all stay in their separate cars and race them and crash into each other and see who's is the best. If they see someone with a car that can barely function, they won't help them, and will expect them to improve their car themselves, whilst spending all their time and resources on making their own already good car even better. It's selfish, really. And pretty stupid when you think about it. But that's the kind of mentality nationalists have, and it's good to understand that when you're dealing with them. I guess to get to the root cause of that kind of thinking, a good strategy could be to spread the narrative that nations don't belong to anybody. They're just pieces of land that have no connection to you, the same as the pieces of land over the rest of the world. You were born in your nation simply due to luck, and nothing else. You don't deserve it, it doesn't belong to you, etc. Nations are technically a social construct (we shouldn't use that wording though). Nations only exist because everybody agrees they exist. If everybody in the world decided that Israel didn't exist, then it wouldn't exist. If everybody in the world decided that Kurdistan and Catalonia are now countries, then they would be countries. That is basically how it works. If California decides it wants to split off from the US and become an independent nation, but everybody else on the planet still considers it part of the US, then really it isn't a nation.",t3_a4pp33,Anarchism

"Capitalism is not money, though. The core of capitalism is the economic system whereby starting capital is subjected to labor to produce goods and services, not explicitly because those are needed, but so that the profit from those services can be transformed back into more capital, to then produce more, then sell more product, repeat *ad nauseam*. The products may often be needed -- but then, they may just as often not be needed and pushed on us via advertising. To do this transformation, capitalism is obliged to use institutions that existed long before it did, such as money and markets. It's very *convenient* for capitalists to have people believe that capitalism is just money and markets, because then they can pretend that capitalism is timeless and inescapable. It's entirely possible, by discarding the capitalist and his pathological urge to always be growing his capital, to have labor produce amounts much closer to what is actually wanted and needed, with the profits going back into the community instead of to a capitalist who does none of the work but simply 'owns' all the things and therefore gets to tell everyone what to do.",t3_a3xx0v,Anarchism

"It's no accident that liberal identity politics arose out of elite institutions, especially Ivy League universities and liberal arts colleges with enormous endowments. It's a form of bureaucratic re-entrenchment, in which privileged institutions neuter mass resistance by co-opting leaders of oppressed groups. Harvard will happily give out student and faculty spots to the 1% most privileged of a minority group, and cloak itself in neoliberal 'wokeness,' if it means it doesn't have to thoroughly deal with the persistent inequality that elite institutions continue to perpetuate. I think identity politics is important -- if you can't acknowledge that black families have an average net worth that's a minuscule fraction of white families, you can't bring about justice.

"Guilty as charged. But what do you propose? Edit: Some people get how revolutionary this idea is, others need a bit more time for it to sink in. That's in the nature of revolutionary ideas, I guess. Online voting is not new (everyone more or less knows about that). What's revolutionary is the tactics to get it implemented using a #Kamikaze Party. I think the flaw in most online Direct Democracy idealist's thinking is that their ideas are practically un-implementable. Not so with this approach. Watching the Google Analytics of people's watch time, I think they are bailing on the video at around 7:48 minutes. Perhaps that's what you did? 'Oh this is just some stupid goddamn online voting system'? If so, you threw out two very valuable babies with the bathwater, both of which could drastically reduce the pain and pressure the People are suffering now from systemic structural-violence, which has turned most of our lives into a seething cesspit. The first is the idea of using #Kamikaze candidates to force through a Constitutional amendment to Articles I II of the US Constitution. The other major idea is People's Standard Contracts. These are a novel use of a Direct Democracy system (#DD) to crowdsource standardized contracts to arm the People against legal ensnarement that the state and its organs and satellites usually force down our throats on a daily basis. As to the presentation style, a lot of thought went in to how to present this. In the end, I thought it would be best to make it as wacky as possible. Some of the reasons were as follows: 1. Once you get a lightbulb moment, and grok what this is all about, then you suddenly realize how vulnerable the state is to this kind of attack. Defenseless, I cautiously hope. Our masters really live in a house of cards (hence the theme music in the intro section - which I'm guessing is one of many subtleties you missed, but I hope not) The thing is though, it's legal and non-violent so it's very difficult for the state to mount a defense against it. In some ways, it's designed to exploit a kind of 'loophole' in the existing system, a kind of chink in it's armor, to strike at its heart and rip it out by the roots. If this idea takes off, I certainly think the Agent Smiths of the state will try to retaliate forcefully against it (what else do the know? - hence the clips from V for Vendetta etc.). So personally, I need a plausible deniability defense for legal reasons. Having found myself under cross-examination in a US court setting on some occasions, my thought was that this video format (and it's borderline crazy content) would be very difficult for a prosecutor to enter as evidence to a jury. Most people would dismiss it like you did (and hopefully that would get me acquitted, rather than sectioned). The cost is, most fish are admittedly lost at first bite. The mitigation is that it doesn't need many fish on the hook to spark ignition and liftoff (excuse the mixed metaphor). 2. Smart people, who instantly grok this project and praxis (and it's hidden depths and nuances), tend to think this must be a state sting operation out to entrap smart people. This is exactly what happened last Friday (twice). I anticipated this in advance and decided the best defence was to make it so totally surreal that no government agency could possible approach it (without actually being Anarchic itself). Play it start-to-finish 50 times, and you will (hopefully) realize that only a sincere Anarchist could make something like this. It's self-signed as diabolical Anarchy once you wrap your head around it. 3. Perhaps I'm reading the tea leaves too deeply, but I strongly suspect we are soon about to enter a time that is so whacked out the world will . In the near future the most outlandish stuff in this series will seem reasonably sane, and hopefully insightful. When we are about to enter crazy times, it's hard to warn people ahead of time without them dismissing you as insane. So I decided to just make it surreal and hope enough people grok it before I have to do the 'I told you so, didn't idea?' video. I thought this should come right to the borderline of a shout out to David Icke. All this is really my ardent plea to get you to watch it from start to finish (assuming you didn't), and then to watch it again and again repeatedly, pausing to fact check and research, until you get a breakthrough. It is constructed like a hologram of information. Far better than 'The Anarchist's Cookbook', if we did our job properly, this is the 'The Anarchist's Holographically Organised Guide to Anti-state Sy-ops'.

The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System and Law Enforcement Bulletin shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.This term was first used by foreign media in 1973 as eponym when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden.

If you work less than .5 worth of a minimum wage, such as single moms working part time, no increase for you either!). Not to mention that this increase in the fund was always planned in his budget, just that it was going to be an increase to 80 euros, spread out over each year of his term. Now he just said they will instead be increased to 80 euros all at once. So what remains is an extra increase of 20 euros that wasn't planned. However, Friday, the senate passed a law proposed by Macron to freeze the adjustment of the fund with regards to inflation. So guess what, the extra 20 euros get erased by inflation. Its 100% a trick to appease people by promising something that was always planned, and what amounts to a highly specific, highly restrictive, extremely meaningless, state paid, fund.

"I've lived many years in Spain and the US, other countries I don't know enough to talk about. In general Spain has a significantly better quality of life and lower cost of living than the US. US culture is more individualized, isolated, alienated, and caught up in the capitalist mentality of consumption and 'productivity' etc. Spain has more communal life, and stronger social movements. There's a much larger squatters movement, a lot of the people I know working in urban gardens and doing rad community projects live in squats. When people don't have to worry about doing economically 'useful' work to pay rent, they have time for the socially useful work they want to do. Social movements and community projects generally are organized non-hierarchically and have some level of anarchist participation. The CNT is a shadow of it's former self, but the memory of it still exists, so people are generally aware that anarchism is an antiauthoritarian and anticapitalist political philosphy. Whereas in the US people generally think libertarians/anarchists are antigovernment and procapitalist, or just nihilists, and that being anticapitalist is anti-freedom (the palmer raids and mccarthyism worked I guess). Rainbow Family and hippy types (generally more or less anarchist in their way of life and thinking, though often not really politically active aside from creating a free zone to live outside the system), from all over Europe have settled in Spain, mostly Andalucia (in la Alpujarra, Sierra de Aracena, Cabo de Gata), and the Canary Islands (all of it lol). Partly just cause the weather's good enough that you can live in improvised structures and not freeze, but also cause they don't get harassed by police as much as in other places. Of course that's all generalizations though, there's all kinds of people everywhere.

">Can you explain to me then why the factions of the Syrian Communist Party (it is my understanding there are two main wings of the party) almost immediately came out in support of Assad when this was still a popular revolt of people that were sick of authoritarian dictatorship? Yes, because they are the orthodox M-L tankies which I've spoken about and have condemned as revisionist on this question. In fact, the only difference they have are being pro and anti-Perestroika. They are just an appendage of the National Progressive Front and coupled along with the incorrect view of the situation at the time, no part in thanks to their revisionism and dogmatism(They view todays world conjuncture exactly as if this were 1930's), they stood with Assad. There's always a theoretical basis for correct or incorrect positions and practice, so we can't be surprised when tankies take a reactionary road. On the other hand there was the Syrian Action Communist Party which are an M-L-MZT leaning formation(This organization tried to initiate People's War in the 1970's but was unfortunately repressed) which many M-L-M's united with on this particular analysis coming out in support with the People's revolt from the beginning.

You won't get anywhere pretending otherwise to socialists and anarchists who have seen the very *names* of their ideologies attacked this way. The same pattern of backing up the owner class against the people is true of the government, incidentally, which is why you see people harassed by cops for feeding real, living homeless folks because they're hurting some fictional property values. So how do you propose to defend a co-op without intimidation? This means that after all the fun of the rioting is over, you'll have to work together to design a new society. You'll have to put in some work. So my question is, why not just start now by doing the work, i.e. the co-op idea? We do. I've given you example after example already. We do both of those things: we build good things and also attack bad things. Your position was 'don't do intimidation and violence because it's not necessary to spread your message', and mine was 'do intimidation and violence because it is necessary to spread your message'. Just so we know where we stand. Do you honestly believe that in your life time you can affect more long lasting change by your current methods than by what I've suggested? Why is France more progressive and more responsive to its peoples' desires than the United States?",t3_a3xx0v,Anarchism
"Anarchism means a horizontally organized, non-hierarchical society. This society is, if not necessarily socialist, for all intents and purposes socialist.

"The problem with that statement is that the owner does not see it your way. I heard you the first time. Did you hear me when I said that people with something to lose from it will always oppose change? To appeal to these people, it's necessary to show them that there's a different way, where they can gain and not lose. So far, so good. However, we're not allowed to show them, because the people with power have a vested interest in making sure that you never see things which prove we have no need of the people with power. You know that 90% of mass media in the U.S. is owned by 6 umbrella companies? There are examples all over the world of the kind of co-ops you've been badgering me for, from the EZLN to Exarcheia to the Mondragon Co-operative Corporation. You don't know about them. *Why* don't you know about them? Because simply making a co-op and waiting for mainstream people to notice you *doesn't work*. So if we have to show middle-class people how our ideology can work for them in order to convince them, and we're not *allowed* to show middle-class people how our ideology can work for them, then it looks an awful lot like those people aren't going to be part of our movement. And while it's very sad that we can't reach them, why would I lose sleep over it when the left has been trying for decades and has been prevented by the people in power? those lowly “workers” have dreams of rising up the ladder and so they champion the system that oppresses them. Which is why it's important to give them examples, so that when their dreams are crushed or threatened, e.g. by a new gas tax that disproportionately hammers the poor, they don't sit and stew and eventually forget, rather they act on their disappointment. I think yo vastly underestimate the ratio of “workers” to the corporate elites. The notion that the working class has the numbers to throw off the ruling class if only they would rise up and do it is a cornerstone of leftist ideologies, so I seriously doubt it. I think the anarchist community vastly over estimates the effect that riots and vandalism have on change and it’s because of the adventure and excitement of it. I mean it’s referred to as riot porn. It’s not taken seriously and treated with a mature reverence as a noble political movement, By the 90% of mass media owned by 6 umbrella corporations? Everyone is “woke” now, everyone gets it, but the establishment keeps winning because they are better at marketing, they are better making actual changes for better or worse, and they are better doing it with a dull lull. They keep winning because they're willing to punish deviation with overwhelming violence. It's quite easy to be good at marketing when you have the industry which shapes public opinion already on your side to cover that up. French police are firing tear-gas grenades with explosive cores that blow off your hand when you try to throw them back. What do you suppose the point of that is? Why don't those gendarmes respect workers and their love of having hands?

Cellulose is a big chunk of earths biomass. This results in a big incentive for complex collective interactions, for instance human inability to digest cellulose has us interacting with cows which interact with bacteria in their guts to digest grass. &#x200B; TLDR; Extracellular, communal activity is a natural state of being, requiring no law or paperwork except the actual digestion of paperwork by microflora.

With companies, similarly, there's the immediate issue of sweat equity fairness on one hand vs. the issue of a sole proprietor being kicked out of his/her creation and the issue of risk being taken by primary investors - most of this can be pretty cleanly resolved for companies even in our current backwards system, by the cooperative model.

In the US however, proliferation of weapons and their disproportionate occurrence in the hands of deranged persons... is a topic. And of course, statistically still, urinary tract infections are more dangerous... not to speak of serious stuff like bicycle accidents... but mass shootings draw the media, and media exposure leaves people thinking that violent crime has risen each year, while no, it really hasn't. I was going to propose that either nobody have weapons or everybody have weapons, but then another thing came to my mind: that everybody have some milder sort of weapons than a machine gun. If everyone carried a modestly powered laser, using a machine gun against a number of people would be useless. A hundred laser pointers can force a military helicopter to **** off temporarily. During the Utoya massacre in Norway, it almost took 2 underage Chechen boys and a handful of stones to succeed against the heavily armed gunman. Unfortunately they didn't, but if there had been 10 people instead of them, then they would have. During an incident in a French train, it took 1 civilian and 2 off-duty soldiers to stop a heavily armed gunman. The civilian got hurt a little. My lesson: if someone attacks, don't flee but attack in numbers.",t3_a942vr,Anarchism

"Well, if we want to se the matter objectively, about the betrayal, we must define the problem that arouse between the bolsheviks and anarchists. Some entered the bolshevik party, some rebelled, and some were useless(Makhno's own words), and even him, the most serius reolutionary at the time that held anarchist beliefs, drove himself more and more in communism in practice(platform, his practices in the free ter.), so this tells my that anarchism when starts revolutions, tends to become socialist/communist, and from that i think that we must let out our personal beliefs, and work for the liberation of the poor, our first, primal goal(at least for me). This is the thing i dont like about a part of the current anarchist movement. They have become more and more alieneted from the goal of freeing the working class and the poor, and the fight against the bourgeoisie, and instead are more and more subscribing themself to what a classical communist would call 'petite bourgeoisie philoshophers' or advunturist. What i mean is that, even here in reddit, i did not find many anarchists saying much about class war or the poor, but more about gay and and feminism rights, which are good, but for me, not the promarily goal of the left movement. Its easy to be leftist in ethics, (gay rights, feminism, freedom of spech) but when the question comes to economy, or defeating counter revolutionaries, people are turning themself away from my questions.

I don't think it's accurate to call such people settlers or colonists, and if a person is say half Vietnamese and half Anglo, what do you call them? Half colonist? This doesn't make sense, it's like calling someone a half-plumber. Colonist isn't some spiritual identity passed down through generations, it's a description of a person based on what they're doing.

"That answer is fine as a question of theory, but people don't care about theory. They care about the real world, and in the real world, that's basically a non-answer. Even when you accept the obvious fact that you could theoretically organize society any way you want, you're still left with the question of which way you're going to organize it in practice, at which point you have to answer all the questions regarding how your new system will accomplish the things people want society to accomplish, and how you make the transition from one form to another. These are perfectly reasonable concerns for people to have. To take the most obvious example, the things on the shelf at the grocery store do not appear there of their own volition. Many people engaged in all sorts of enterprise combine through various interactions to put them there. At the moment, that happens in a particular way for particular reasons, and there are particular methods for distributing those things. If you change the rules and the incentives of society, as the abolition of capitalism would, then you need a new way of causing people's various endeavors to combine to result in there being food available, and a new way of deciding who gets what and why. This is the kind of thing people are thinking about when they ask you what you're going to replace capitalism with, and you really should be able to answer those questions one way or another if you're serious about converting people into anti-capitalist revolutionaries. The internet might love principled arguments about coercion and natural rights and horizontal power distributions and all the rest of the arguments from political philosophy, but most people are preoccupied with keeping the gas on and raising their kids, and they don't care about horizontal power distributions. They want to know where the food will be and who will make the medicine.

However the fact remains that the CRS began life as the GMR and their initial force was comprised of ex-GMR men and new recruits (lots being communists). Not all of the CRS was disbanded in '47; just those units that were dominated by communist party members and fellow travellers - the much more reliable ex-GMR men and their ilk were retained.,t3_a2rtxe,Anarchism

"Maybe it’s my fault for instigating the negative tone of this conversation because I genuinely want to converse with anarchists to understand what it’s about but my passion for the positions I hold overwhelm me at times so let me attempt to reel it in. I think your response is missing what I’m trying to show you which is that behind all of the businesses that you hold up as your enemies are people. How is it that you feel that you can decide on someone else’s behalf, say for example a Starbucks barista, that they should feel oppressed or that you know better enough to force them from their current life? How can you do that without seeing the hypocrisy of those actions? If you claim to be interested in freedom, what if you succeed and then with that freedom a large group of people decide to freely organize themselves into a capitalist society? What then? Your argument about the luxury car example is revealing so much of what you are projecting onto other people whom you have never met. My cousin drives BMW. She saved up forever for it, working her ass off in the service industry, and it’s just something she really enjoys. She also lives in small apartment that she rents on the rough side of town. How is she your enemy, so much so that you’d want destroy something that brings her happiness? I just don’t understand how violence and intimidation will ever produce any sort of positive response. Do you want the whole world to be anarchy or just a few cities? What is the ultimate goal, and why do think trying to force anarchism upon the world by force is any different than any other ideologues trying to do the same? Personally I don’t want to live in anarchy and chaos. That’s not the reality I was born into or desire. I enjoy civilized reality and I also recognize its problems but problems aren’t fixed by destruction they are fixed by good ideas being proven to work by smart people leading by example and inspiring others to follow. I think the frustration and anger that anarchists exhibit is warranted. There’s so much corruption horror happening in the world but I also think it’s misplaced and it’s without care or regard for the people who are actually affected. Even the people who hold the power are human beings, not all of them are evil tyrants but none of them will be convinced to change by making them an enemy. They need to be shown by proven examples that there is a better way. But where are these prosperous anarchist societies? Where are the examples for us to look at as outsiders and say yes that makes sense let’s do that? They don’t exist because the message we are getting from you is that society needs to change into what you want and then you’ll change too. Why not establish an example of what anarchy looks like somewhere and we can decide for ourselves? ",t3_a3xx0v,Anarchism

"I feel this way as well. I think much of the praxis in these Crimethinc works are counter-productive. For example, *Recipes for Disaster* tries to give different ideas for how to shut down a fast-food joint. While I am sympathetic to veganism and animal liberation, and also shutting down fast food in general, taking it upon yourself to shut down a fast-food place seems to me to be rather ineffective praxis. 1. the people most harmed by this are the workers and lower classes, not the large corporations - the people who are put out of work and forced to try to put things back together under threat of their bosses seems to be a way of making the wrong people's day particularly bad 2. the shut down of a single store isn't realistically going to solve or benefit much; much like the failed Propaganda of the Deed period of anarchism, the thought that shutting down a fast food joint is going to incite more revolt or spark a revolution seems entirely ill-conceived and ignores the position of nearly everyone else in that situation. At what point can we still call this anarchism if the action is so entirely anti-social and so willing to override the autonomy of others? At what point does this kind of praxis not just become the epitome of what anarchists work so hard against: a perception that anarchism promotes chaos and disorder. A much better praxis, in my mind, would be to organize the workers of the fast-food joint, to convince people with compelling and truthful arguments that fast food is a murderous industry, and to only shut down fast food places with a concerted, organized effort by the workers (preferably federated with other stores to make a greater impact, and preferably with demands that will actually change daily life for people). That is anarchism in my mind. *Recipes for Disaster* has many general skills and pieces of information that could be used in different ways, and I'm not suggesting it's devoid of value. Rather, I just feel the aim of Crimethinc in general alienates the general public, fails to have any impact, and actively works against the principles of anarchism as taking seriously individual autonomy and the welfare of the public.

"I think there are far greater differences between a riot and a revolution than the outcome... IMO rioting and revolution are two very different actions that energy and popular discontent can be channeled into. Riots rarely have any real ideological direction or lead to any serious systemic change. They are just a visceral outpouring of anger in the absence of institutions, organized labor, and other mechanisms that could allow people to use that anger to actually create a better society. Most (probably all) legitimate, successful, productive left-libertarian revolutions that I'm aware of did not take the form of rioting.... There may have been rioting concurrent with or prior to some these revolutions, but I think that's just a very common way for suffering people who are not politically conscious or organized to vent their rage. Most often, if the mass of the people doing the rioting were very class conscious and organized, they wouldn't feel so desperately hopeless as to resort to just torching cars and smashing storefronts. Instead they could actually use that anger to motivate political activity, to organize workplaces, to create a left-wing infrastructure that is actually threatening to power. IMO all riots really do is justify police violence and mass arrests in the eyes of the electorate of the liberal establishment and (in the case of riots that are politicized) up portray anarchism as not a profound, nuanced political-philosophic tradition with a long history and clear goals, but just as violent thugs who want to tear their countries apart and thrust us from the order of the known into the kind of rage-induced chaos that riots represent. I also am unsure what to make of these protests. While of course there are many regular working people involved in these events, at a glance it certainly has the vibe of a manufactured social movement, or at very least one which is being shaped and guided by ruling class financiers. The fact that it's explicitly about taxes is a big indicator. The fact that, unlike previous protests in France, I am not seeing black and red flags in every photo of the crowds, but mostly French flags. I fear that this does have the potential to become a Euromaidan-like nationalistic right-wing fiasco. After all, this comes just a week or two after Macron explicitly rejected nationalism as a threat, and aside from being opposed to this tax, the unifying theme seems to just be opposition to Macron's liberal government. I'm sure there are left-wingers trying to seize upon these protests as an opportunity, but, unlike previous highly labor-oriented mass protests and strikes, I am having trouble finding any obvious indicators of a sincere left-wing protest, let alone anything more radical... It could be that this is used to justify Macron's government pivoting to the more neoconservative end of the neoliberal spectrum, or it could eventually give rise to National Front (or another far-right party) as the alternative that people flock to-- fear of widespread chaos does tend to move liberals to seek 'law and order' in the form of fascism.

It conflates both issues in a way that I don't think they should be, (while yes, the lower/working classes are going to be more affected by taxes being raised, there are other ways to combat both high standards of living and environmental degredation) and makes me support the movement far less. Additionally, the movement has no real leadership and seems to acknowledge that if they get Macron out, they'll just go back to infighting. It seems like a recipe for disaster, honestly.

"Thanks for asking - long answer hopefully accurate: One aspect is that there are lots of relatively recent memories of the civil war (communist ww2 resistance Vs state army+British reinforcement) and the persecution that followed. People's grandparents/parents fought in the war and/or were exiled or tortured in the 50s and then again by the military regime in the 60s. So a fairly big part of the population has at least some respect for people of communist beliefs who fought against the Nazis, the military, and the dictatorship. Generally I would say (but I could have a skewed view on this) that saying someone's grandpa was in the state army during the civil war can be viewed as a gross insult, whereas saying that one's grandparents were in the resistance and then fought on the side of the communists can be used as bragging/'credentials' of someone's left-wing upbringing. The main 'orthodox' communist party has a relatively stable percentage of 4-5% in every national election. People joke that it's like a religion, it doesn't gain much, it doesn't lose much (supporters tend to be for life) it just stays stable, also with stable youth recruitment. But there are lots of smaller communist parties too, there's one prefaced with 'M-L' (Marxist-Leninist) and one adding (M-L) at the end in brackets - cue in Monty Python joke. Similar - or now larger is the percentage of staunch anti-communists and with the rise of the far-Right nowadays this Discourse is heard a lot more than in the past. What's ridiculous (funny+sad at once) is that the current ruling party got elected as a 'coalition of the radical left' meaning that the general public was willing to put faith in a radical left party (which included a few communist fractions) precisely because the Left has enjoyed the level of respect I described above. Of course the party turned out to be as 'radical' as your average Democrat/Labour party in any two-party system (only slightly left of center) but those far-Right/ alt-Right anti-communists still manage to evoke 'Stalin' in their discourse against it.",t3_a8o96m,Anarchism

I didn't say all of it should be discarded, but large chunks of work preserved on places like the IMA aren't really needed and are more just fluff for the dedicated fan. Kautsky was a Marxist, Lenin was as well. I'm not sure what your point is. Regardless of that, Luxemburg broke decisively with Kautsky and said the revolution needed to be by, from and for the masses. Mattick and Luxemburg don't need to be completely and inequivocally reconciled to be able to use both their ideas. Most Marxists' own writings don't even bother to reconcile with themselves as they develop over time. Dauve is only mentioned because I've read him and agree with some of what he has written, such as his critique of Rojava. I do not, however, agree with all of it, chief amongst it his attempt to reconcile the Ultra-left and Left-coms. I do not tie myself to any one particular theoretician, and neither should anyone else, that's why I simply said 'Marxist' than something specific or contradictory like 'Marxist-Leninist' or 'Luxemburgist' or 'anti-revisionist' or 'leninist-humanist.'

Once the informbiro feud ended and we did the whole yugoslavian socialism thing the state was very non intrusive in daily lives and sometimes even beneficial. Having said that it was also a bit state-capitalist. Enough propaganda. I believe in left unity to the extent that we should not be fighting separate revolutions and fights. However history makes me worried and Im not entirely sure whether betraying anarchists is generally a vanguardist thing or if the bolsheviks were just a unique cancer on the movement. Ultimately people should decide which version they want to live in but only if they are well informed of what they are deciding on.,t3_a3ami6,Anarchism

">Has your labor vote ended poverty and hardship yet? No, obviously not. But anything that helped my local MP, an absolutely wonderful women, is a good thing. And anything to get rid of our last MP, a toxic pro-fracking pro-gambling pro-austerity piece of shit out of power is also a good thing. Do you believe it's possible to have an all labor government (or at least vast control of the government)? Anything is possible. If so, do you believe poverty and hardship would end then? No, but I believe that the risk of someone I know killing themselves would be lower, that more would be done for the homeless population of my city, that the NHS would stop collapsing and that tens of thousands of people have been killed as of yet by austerity. I think talking to people about why I don't vote has done more good than any of my votes would. Maybe. Probably. But I think you don't realise that I talk to people about why I hate voting, about what I hate about the system and everything else **yet also vote because I need to get the local Tory out of office**. You can do both! But the material reality comes before an ideological stand for me. Will I stop protesting if Corbyn gets in? Fuck no. I protested Labour before and I will do it again. But, right now, in this time, in this place, the Tories are killing people. They are the reasons I have lost one friend so far and might end up losing more. I have friends who will die if they lose their benefits, terrified of protesting because the police have started handing over images of disabled protesters. Is voting a violation of my anarchist principles? Fucking obviously. But to resist we must first survive and I am not going to throw millions of people under the bus to take an ideological stand. I will do both. If voting is as meaningless as you say why not do it *anyway*, just to make the world a little less shit if you can. Hell, 95% of peaceful protest is fucking meaningless too, I still attend a march when I can (Because solidarity makes the world a better place and a friend of mine is facing fucking terrorism charges for a peaceful protest).

"Anarchist have literally fought alongside the statist left throughout their history, perhaps most notably in the Spanish civil war. They also tend to be found amongst the statist left during their activism, as social democracy, anarchism and marxist communism are effectively different answers to the same set of problems. One of the most popular forms of activism among anarchists is anti-fascism, aka punching Nazis. The main stands of anarchism today are syndicalism and anarchist communism - both are effectively communist i.e. far left. I think the following are possible reasons for this confusion: \- An ahistorical understanding of the word anarchism (and no theoretical understanding of communism, which isnt just the USSR). \- Not understanding that the left right axis is a gross oversimplification and only provides a useful shorthand. Using this shorthand conventionally anarchism is 'left' \- Using the soviet union and right libertarians as the poles of a political axis, which is part of the right's ploy to make oppression only a function of the state, giving the other tyrannies they love (capitalism, racism, sexism, LGBTQ discrimination ect) a free pass, whilst blocking social democratic attempts to increase equality. &#x200B; A political compass is a two axis model, whilst still obviously super simplified perhaps looking one up might help you understand?

"I agree, first we abolish the capitalist productive system! I think how we will produce after that is going to have to be decided regionally and according to the specific needs of that area and population (agricultural abilities etc). But basically being anti-state can entail that there will be small decision making groups or even a couple representitives for each designated area for larger political decision making. Then production for basic needs could also just be done collectively within designated areas. (Think of Cuba's Organiponicos). The idea however is everyone to be free to fulfil they're highest potential so like sciences will have to go through transition into a non-capitalist productive thought and focus only on existing for the bettering of societies. Most likely all resources like labs and so on will be existing still after the revolution, but as recourses won't be attained through just ordering them on Amazon we may have to adapt to getting craftier and using what trash and rummage and materials which already exist.

"I would not suggest using the phrase 'fake news' in this context. Initially the term was applied to actually fake news articles (do a search on the phrase 'I’m just tired of the L.A. lifestyle and I feel like, at this point in my life, I’d rather just live in a place full of real, genuine people. ' for example and you'll find made up articles about a celeb moving to a town) where the intent wasn't even to *distort* the truth. They just made up stories These started taking a political nature because it gets clicks. In order to deflect from this, Trump and the right started muddling the use of the phrase to apply to things like CNN. While they are not really honest in how they present things, they aren't making up events wholesale. What the 'real' media does is much more carefully handled. Actually occurring events are presented with a narrative where carefully chosen interviews and quotes, edited video, integration of opinion into news reporting, and so forth obscure what's truly going on. The protests in France are another example of this. It's not *untrue* that fuel taxes are what sparked them but it's not really honest to present it as being over fuel taxes. The right latched onto it because of an anti-environmental policy agenda, while liberals also accepted this narrative because they need to defend neoliberal economic policy. Once the other aspects of why the protests occurred started to bubble up over this misrpresentation, the claims now became similar to OWS where people try to dismiss them as not having a clear message or not being what the movement was initially about.

Mr. Erdogan has threatened to launch an assault on the Kurds. The U.S. has relied on the Kurdish forces as the most effective fighting force in Syria against Islamic State. On the call, Mr. Trump told Mr. Erdogan that he no longer wanted to spend money and time in Syria and preferred instead to focus his energy on domestic issues, said an official briefed on the call. Mr. Erdogan assured Mr. Trump that Turkey would continue the fight against Islamic State—and against the Kurds, the official said.

I'm not saying that ICE's camps are trips to DisneyLand by comparison; these things can both be heart-breakingly horrific, but can we please not pretend they're of equal horror? I get that China believes it has to go to some extremes to get a handle on its 1.5 billion person population, and I can see the potential value in their social credit system. I also see how it can easily be abused by the wealthy who can apparently raise their score by donating to charity. While we rag on China for the terrible things it's been doing we should also be ragging on other nations for pulling similar crap. It is hypocritical of the USA to condemn China's camps when ICE camps continue to exist.

"The difference here being that states like the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are all *colonial* states regardless of whether or not the dominant narrative considers the 'colonial period' to be in the past. The problem with denying the fact that, say, Australia is *still* colonial is that it implies, necessarily, that the colonists won, that the aboriginal people of Australia are only an artifact of the past, and that the descendants of the original European colonists have a legitimate claim to the land now. At least with an openly colonial state, there's still a colonizer/colonized dynamic: the colonizer readily admits and accepts what he's doing, that is, forcefully forcing indigenous people off of their traditional territories. The states that develop after the initial colonization are still colonial, they have just legitimized their presence on the land. That's the problem with saying 'My ancestors were colonists, but I'm not' while still living on the land your ancestors colonized. You've legitimized their colonization and you've legitimized your own claim to the land. You relegate us to a historical time period, and you expect us to stay put there. But we're not artifacts of the past: we're here and we continue to occupy the land we have for centuries. We refuse to give it up. Even with OP's situation I will call them a colonist, perhaps an unwillingly and respectful colonist, but a colonist none-the-less. ",t3_a4qr53,Anarchism

"I used to think like this. You know what changed? My wife and I had a child, and we could no longer make it work in a 600 sq ft house. So we moved into my buddies house (he was moving in with his wife). The idea was that we could have more space while trying to figure out how to save for our new house. In the meantime I rented out our old house. I always rented at below market value and I didn't charge first, last and deposit because that shit is ridiculous. Who can afford that? All I charged was enough to break even. Then you know what happened? Both sets of my renter's trashed the place, and left me holding the bill, while constantly having me come over to put a single screw in a light fixture, and shit like that. All while I was trying to figure out how to be a dad, and trying to figure out when I was ever going to sleep again. So yeah, I was a little stressed. And I learned why landlords are dicks. It's because everyone trashes the shit you've worked your ass off for. Just because someone has more than you doesn't make them a bad guy. That mindset just justifies your need to be angry at someone. And it's easy because someone will always have more than you.

"There are different branches of anarchism. Anarcho-communism is one of them. So the difference is the same as the difference between dogs and labradors, anarchism is the umbrella term. Anarcho-communism in particular puts emphasis on collectivist organisation. Anarcho-communists are in favor of worker councils and direct-democratic communes. They are the kind of anarchists that are probably the closest you can find to actual government-structures. In contrast some other branches of more individualist anarchists oppose all kinds of formal organisation. However anarcho-communist concepts also hugely overlap with some other branches of anarchism such as anarcho-syndicalism or anarcho-collectivism. If you want to fully understand the concept of anarcho-communism you will not get around reading books about it. As another commenter already posted, Kropotkin would be the best start for that.

"As you can tell from most of the posts, anarchists of many varieties aren't fond of capitalism. Historically speaking, anarchism grew within the socialist movement, even joining the First International, and many anarchists have fought alongside various socialist groups in many conflicts, from the Spanish Civil War, WWII, and even in the Syrian Civil War, and have also taken part in many labor strikes alongside other socialists. Anarchists, like statist socialists, want to abolish capitalism not only because of the inequality and poverty capitalism produces, but also because of our commitment to anti-authoritarian and libertarian values. Capitalist business are run in a really hierarchical and authoritarian manner, in which business owners, managers, etc., make decisions for everyone without employees input, there are few to no ways to hold powerful people accountable for their actions, meeting are often done behind closed doors thus lacking any transparency, those higher up in a company often make a profit at the expense of employees etc. To answer your question about where the division is between anarchism and state-oriented socialists, to put it simply, anarchists don't view the government as a good or viable means to building a stateless and classless society. We instead propose the people to self-organize to get rid of tyrants and authoritarian systems, and run society in a way that prevents tyranny from forming. That includes abolishing capitalism, but also things like governments, nation-states, fundamentalist organized religions, racism, sexism, etc. Though in short, no, 'anarcho'-capitalism is not a form of anarchism, due to them still holding onto authoritarian forms of organization.",t3_a7rli1,Anarchism

"Beautiful rendition of Joe Hill's final will set to music. Joe Hill was a swedish immigrant and organizer for the IWW, and became famous for writing many labor songs, some of which are still sung to this day. In 1915 he was falsely accused of a murder he didn't commit and was killed by firing squad on November 19, 1915 In Salt Lake City. Before his execution he wrote out his last will in the form of a poem. Rest in Power, Joe. You ain't dead. *My will is easy to decide* *For there is nothing to divide* *My kin don't need to fuss and moan* *'Moss does not cling to a rolling stone'* *My body?-Oh!

">I mean, if I were a Marxist-Leninist I would have to, but I'm not. I'll first say that I'm not a Marxist-Leninist. I'm a Marxist. Secondly, are your observations determined by your adherence to an ideology? Are you not compelled to recognize the material foundation of the state as a self-proclaimed 'materialist' regardless of political ideology? >I think you can do an anti-state reading of Marx. Sure, if you distort Marx's writings enough. You can even make him look like a liberal with deceptive and selective quotations. But to read Marx with the goal to pin a position onto him (such as anti-statism) is not honest. Marx saw the state as the artificial community of humans in which a ruling class expresses its interests as the general interests of society (cf. the German Ideology, Ch. 1, part 4). But Marx didn't go so far as to make the idealist error that the state can be eradicated prior to the conditions within society itself that necessitate it. >Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the Marxist-Leninist view of the state, the state is a neutral formation of power that is a tool to be used by whoever is able to seize control of it. This assumes that the state is a historical constant, seized and controlled by the rulers in each of Marx's 'stages' of history: from slave society to feudalism to capitalism to communism (in the DotP). Not Marxist-Leninist, Marxist (let's not confuse a state ideology with communism). The state is *not* 'a neutral formation of power.' This conception is more in-line with democratic socialists. Marx was explicit after the events of the Paris Commune that the goal of the proletariat upon seizing power is to smash the bourgeois state, not simply take control of it (Marx and Engels subsequently returned to the Communist Manifesto and stated in a preface this lesson from 1871). Marx did not assume the state to be a historical constant; it was the product of class society which is neither a constant in human history. How can Marx, at the same time, uphold the state to be a condition for all human history and then theorize its abolition following the dictatorship of the proletariat? That's absurd. And lastly, Marx did not create an a priori scheme of stages in human history. Take a letter Marx wrote to the editor of a Russian newspaper in 1877: >Now what application to Russia can my critic make of this historical sketch? Only this: If Russia is tending to become a capitalist nation after the example of the Western European countries, and during the last years she has been taking a lot of trouble in this direction – she will not succeed without having first transformed a good part of her peasants into proletarians; and after that, once taken to the bosom of the capitalist regime, she will experience its pitiless laws like other profane peoples. That is all. But that is not enough for my critic. He feels himself obliged to metamorphose my historical sketch of the genesis of capitalism in Western Europe into an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale [general path] imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself, in order that it may ultimately arrive at the form of economy which will ensure, together with the greatest expansion of the productive powers of social labour, the most complete development of man. But I beg his pardon. (He is both honouring and shaming me too much.) In the rest of the letter (and, I think, but I'm not sure offhand, in a letter to Kugelmann), he describes that the communes existing in Russia have the *potential* to 'skip' capitalist production and, with the aid of a European proletarian revolution, could serve as the basis for the development of communism in Russia. Marx was never interested in a priori dogmas, but critical science of the existing conditions. >This notion of the state and of stages of history is based on a 19th century ahistorical Eurocentric worldview It is based on a misunderstanding of Marx. >The modern state of the 18th/19th/20th centuries is a historically particular formation of power created by and for the bourgeoisie, for the express purpose of maintaining bourgeois class dynamics. This was not discovered recently -- not explicitly sure when -- but Marx makes this comment in his 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program. Today, in capitalist society, the States can vary in their functions and constitutions, but they 'all have this in common: that they are based on modern bourgeois society.' They may have 'diversity of form,' but have their 'essential characteristics in common.' >Anarchist communism is not opposed to an economic monopoly. I won't speak for the egoists and individualists here though. The anarchists in Ukraine or in Spain absolutely monopolized the economy, through the collectivization of land in places where they had power. I'm not familiar with the experiences of Spain and Ukraine. So answer me this: were the collectives cooperatively owned by the producers within these collectives? If so, that is not yet a monopoly, no nationalization of the means of production. >Your caricature of peasants as fundamentally reactionary and backward is pretty silly and very 19th century. I would think that Maoism would at least convince you that peasants can be revolutionary, if the Zapatistas don't. How so? The peasantry, if not guided by the proletariat and its party, only has in its interests the democratic revolution, not the socialist revolution. The experiences of the PRC, the Third World national liberation movements and the Zapatistas prove that. >organized from the bottom up, minimizing hierarchies and creating a new society built on mutual aid rather than replicating the exploitative structures of the old. It's not necessary for them to proclaim 'anarchism', since anarchism is not a party to join or even necessarily a theory to subscribe to, but a way of doing things.

"\>one question i have is what anarchist organizing to actually seize power looks like? Yea this is a good question that all anarchists need to take seriously, IMO. Believe me, I have been downvoted to hell on this subreddit for suggesting that anarchists should even think about taking power at all. There are certainly some anarchists who think anarchism means making a commune in the woods and living outside state and capitalist systems, which in my view only empowers the state and the capitalists by serving as a pressure valve to remove their potential enemies from the field. Power is always going to exist and it's not something that can be abolished. Instead, the question is whether power will be held in the hands of a few, or whether we can spread it out among everyone. Spreading power to everyone equally is the end goal of anarchism. On to your question: Historically, there are a variety of anarchist approaches for contesting power, and I would say the fact that anarchists have constantly updated their methods is an advantage over MLs, who have stuck to the same approach for about 100 years. I think it should be noted that early Russian revolutionaries had many anarchists among their ranks, and the idea of creating mass worker soviets (councils) in each city to control production and distribution through a general assembly was heavily influenced by anarchist thought. Ties between early Soviets and anarchists were closer than many people realize. Lenin's brother was an anarchist executed by the Tsar. The Makhnovists in Ukraine began as independent soviets, and they only began resisting the Bolsheviks when they were commanded to submit to Moscow's central authority. Later in Spain (1936), anarchists experimented with entering into a popular front with communists and social democrats. They were the largest bloc by far and they organized into military brigades. Moreso than the Russian Revolution, in Spain there was a genuine uprising from below where farmers and urban workers collectivized their workplaces, formed general assemblies, and issued labor vouchers for all work based on work-hours rather than capitalist systems of value. This way, 8 hours worked in the field became equivalent to 8 hours worked as an artisan, and networks for exchanging agricultural Since then, other successful models of anarchist power are in Chiapas with the EZLN, and Rojava in northern Syria. I would say a major innovation of these struggles is the way that both have adapted to local systems of meaning. Neither call themselves anarchist. The Zapatistas reject all western philosophical labels, organizing instead through indigenous Mayan principles of equality and democracy. In Rojava, a coalition of leftist groups and Kurdish independence fighters work together to achieve their aims. Regardless of labels, both of these groups have managed to achieve organizational structures that are very anarchist-- general assemblies, 'leaderless' and horizontally organized military brigades, gender equality in work, and attempts at communalization and the abolition of money, profit and property. They aren't perfect but as long as MLs will defend the USSR by saying 'things weren't perfect because of the material conditions', I will continue to defend the Zapatistas and Rojava for the same reasons. In the US and Europe, anarchists mainly organize around mass movements. Rather than trying to build a separate party, anarchists believe that their organizing should take place directly where the struggle is, because that's where the masses are. Whether it's Black Lives Matter, OWS, Standing Rock, the teachers strikes, migrant aid or the Yellow Vests, anarchists are on the front lines. A good example of orgs doing this kind of work is the Black Rose / Rosa Negra in the US, or anarchist groups in Greece providing and caring for refugees. One development we have seen over the last 10 years or so since the Arab Spring is that horizontalism is no longer a niche idea or a even a choice-- it is the main way that mass movements are organized in this era of surveillance and control, and participating in horizontal organizing is almost mandatory if you want to be a part of a movement. Every major uprising from Tahrir Square in 2011, to OWS, to Ukraine in 2014, to BLM, to the Yellow Vests today, has been horizontally organized, and every one has caught the stagnant labor unions and communist parties of Europe and the US with their pants down and off guard. I see this as a vindication of anarchist theories-- anarchism, whether people realize or not, is becoming the mainstream, dominant mode of extra-electoral political organizing in the 21st century. &#x200B; The unfulfilled question, however, is what to do after the old powers are broken and scattered. In Egypt and Ukraine, for instance, horizontalist organizing was very effective at toppling the regime, but left much to be desired in terms of creating a new, better society from the ashes of the old. In both these cases, anarchist and other left organizers who did a lot of the work of revolution were outflanked by the military and the fascists, who were able to consolidate power in the vacuum created by the horizontalists. Going forward, it is of the utmost importance that we figure out how to transition from a horizontal insurrection to a disciplined force that can banish fascist and militarist elements successfully, without falling back on something like an ML party. &#x200B; And yes I'd say you're correct about workerism. I don't think it's going anywhere soon, since all of the 'automation' we see today still relies on workers, even though they aren't the types of workers we traditionally imagine, and they may live thousands of miles away from where the so-called automation is actually happening.",t3_a76th7,Anarchism

"Anarchism is the ideology that the state should be abolished. It's against all forms of hierarchy. There are many schools of anarchism which differ in their opinions on economics. Anarchism is for the most part anti-capitalist (the one kind that isn't, anarcho-capitalism, is seen as a joke by most anarchists). This means the economic systems they support are forms of socialism (i.e. they want to share property). Communism is a radical kind of socialism which advocates abolishing all private property and money as well. So anarcho-communism means the abolition of the state as well as property, markets, and money. That means it is the complete opposite of capitalism. Some kinds of anarchism aren't quite as radical and may want to have social ownership of property but not abolish money, for example. They all have similar goals though. ",t3_a60u9e,Anarchism

Most of their forces were organized throughout Quebec and traveled to Ottawa to propagate their hatred for migrants and refugees and white supremacist agenda. The demonstration was triggered by an upcoming United Nations declaration on migration being a human right. Knowing the fear they have kicked up about migrants and refugees, the fascist groups (with help from the establishment right) used this opportunity to mobilize their support base to grow their movement. Antifascist forces organized to show them that they're not welcome in our community.

">if it is, then you'd have to recognize that the abolition of the state cannot be effected until the changes in the economic foundation of society have occurred to render the state a superfluous institution. I mean, if I were a Marxist-Leninist I would have to, but I'm not. >Such institution can only be controlled by that class which has as its interests the abolition of capitalist production, the proletariat. Against a stronger and more experienced class, the bourgeoisie, this institution must also be a state, insofar as it an organ for domination with a monopoly on violence. If you want to call any group of anarchists organized to take power, collectivize land and workplaces, and suppress the ruling class a state, go ahead I guess. It doesn't really matter, but this is the basis of the split between anarchists and Marxists and I'm guessing you know that. Really it's the split between an anarchist/marxist perspective and the Marxist-Leninists, since I think you can do an anti-state reading of Marx. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the Marxist-Leninist view of the state, the state is a neutral formation of power that is a tool to be used by whoever is able to seize control of it. This assumes that the state is a historical constant, seized and controlled by the rulers in each of Marx's 'stages' of history: from slave society to feudalism to capitalism to communism (in the DotP). This notion of the state and of stages of history is based on a 19th century ahistorical Eurocentric worldview, which assumes the existence of state power back throughout all time and in all parts of the world, and which cannot imagine a society without state power, much like how liberals cannot imagine a society without capitalist relations. Marx can be forgiven for this view since he was a product of his time. But we can now see that this view is incorrect in light of any consideration of modern understandings of archaeology, anthropology, and history. In fact, pre-modern formations of power did not look much like the modern state. The modern state of the 18th/19th/20th centuries is a historically particular formation of power created by and for the bourgeoisie, for the express purpose of maintaining bourgeois class dynamics. The hierarchies of the state and the ways in which the state manages labor mirror the structures of capitalist enterprises. For instance, when soviets were organized during the early Russian Revolution, they had a large degree of autonomy, and power was in the hands of the workers. As soon as they were incorporated into the USSR, they lost almost all of their power to their new bosses in the Politburo. In terms of the organization of labor, it's pretty striking how closely production under Stalin mirrored the Fordist factory of the capitalist west. >Anarchism's tenets of autonomy, self-determination, individualism, and federalism reflected the reaction of the poor peasants and petty-bourgeoisie who suffered daily from capitalist expansion and the threat of sinking into the proletariat. But in that sense, it's reactionary in program, since it seeks to adopt pre-capitalist or at least early-capitalist levels of production, anything that opposes monopoly -- when in fact the dictatorship of the proletariat must have an economic monopoly. Anarchist communism is not opposed to an economic monopoly. I won't speak for the egoists and individualists here though. The anarchists in Ukraine or in Spain absolutely monopolized the economy, through the collectivization of land in places where they had power. Your caricature of peasants as fundamentally reactionary and backward is pretty silly and very 19th century. I would think that Maoism would at least convince you that peasants can be revolutionary, if the Zapatistas don't. >In what way do you figure the Paris Commune to be anarchistic? It certainly can't be because there were anarchists involved, just as the French Revolution wasn't proletarian because proletarians were involved. It was anarchist in the same way that the Zapatistas are anarchist-- organized from the bottom up, minimizing hierarchies and creating a new society built on mutual aid rather than replicating the exploitative structures of the old. It's not necessary for them to proclaim 'anarchism', since anarchism is not a party to join or even necessarily a theory to subscribe to, but a way of doing things. I'm not sure I follow the rest of your post, about whether my discussion of free speech is idealist or materialist. I think you're basically just assuming that since I'm not a Marxist-Leninist, my perspective isn't materialist.

"'Anarcho-capitalists' invariably define either 'anarchism' or 'capitalism' incorrectly, usually both. The vast majority of people who call themselves this are propertarians, like Rothbard, and they are not anarchists. Anti-statists or voluntaryists perhaps, if you take them at their word, but even those do not meet the bar of anarchism. Anarchism requires a structural critique that voluntaryists simply lack. As long as they pick and choose the kind of 'archies' they defend, they will never be anarchists, no matter how voluntary their society is. There are an extremely small number of these people who simply define 'capitalism' so broadly that it's effectively meaningless, and may in fact be a variant of market anarchists, though that's up to further details on their position. Personally, I don't have much faith in any kind of market anarchism that doesn't attempt to address the fundamental exploitation in capitalism. ",t3_a7rli1,Anarchism

"THE STORY BEHIND THE “GOOD NIGHT WHITE PRIDE” IMAGE: May 9, 1998: The KKK, decide to hold a rally in Ann Arbor, MIchigan despite having their asses handed to them there two years earlier. The Ann Arbor city council obliges them, spending $137,000 of taxpayer money to accommodate their hatefest in the middle of town. Anti-Racist Action, the Revolutionary Workers’ League, and the National Women’s Rights Organizing Committee all mobilize to confront the KKKlowns. This photo of an Ann Arbor anti-racist showing a racist scumbag some Michigan hospitality is legendary and is where the Good Night White Pride logo comes from. In all, five people were injured during the ruckus before the Klan were shut down and run out of town. In the weeks that followed, Ann Arbor city officials and police launched an unprecedented manhunt to arrest 39 anti-racists for the “crime” of opposing a racist terrorist organization operating publicly in their community. In the end, twenty anti-racists faced charges; sixteen of them had their charges dropped and just one was convicted, for allegedly throwing a rock that hit a cop. The lessons of Ann Arbor on May 9, 1998 have repeated themselves in the years since: people standing together can take their streets back from racist scum; city officials and police are happy to spend tax dollars protecting racists and persecuting anti-racists; and most importantly, fighting hate is not a crime!",t3_a9nxh2,Anarchism

I'm not obliged to give up my claim on the accumulated knowledge and wealth of human heritage and go live in a hole for the sake of decorum. How is your current tactic more effective? I'm sure within the echo chamber of anarchist media it seems like a big deal but world wide anarchism is barely a fringe element of society. Giving a reason and an outlet for the inchoate anger of oppressed people is always useful. Anarchist ideas spread like a virus. We're not Trotskyists and it's not important that we get more people to identify as anarchists. What's important is to agitate them and point them at their oppressors. Look at the way France bursts into demonstrations -- do you suppose France has so many more anarchists per capita than the U.S. or Russia? No, what it has is a long tradition of rebels and revolutionaries burning shit down and demanding rights. dawn ski masks Don, not dawn. As in, a shortening of 'do on'. Opposite of doff, 'do off'. To be honest the poverty comment is me just regurgitating things I've heard and read from sources I tend to trust but I'm not willing to die on that hill without doing my own research. Ok.  with a good summary of the leftist argument if you want it. I think the idea that you are born into a world where every stitch of land is already owned is insane. I think land and resources should be equally divided among all human beings, living and forecast to come. There is more than enough land for everyone to build their own house and barely make a dent. I also think there should be some sort salary cap mechanism to prevent people from accumulating too much wealth. How will you make it happen? We're getting worse in all of these areas, so it's pretty clear that electoral politics and polite, scheduled protests in pussy hats don't have the answer you want. However we have to leave room, in the name of freedom, for the various levels of ambition that people possess. Why do you consider the freedom of the rich to gain so much property they can oppress others more important than the freedom of the poor to live free from that oppression? Would you permit a man to pursue his dream of becoming a slave-owner in the name of respecting his freedom? We can't punish people harder workers and more motivated than others. Poor people work harder and are more motivated than rich ones. Their motivations are all shaped and constrained by the rich to matters of survival, which (conveniently for the rich) is not regarded as true motivation. But some of these poor work two or three jobs just to keep a family alive -- could you motivate yourself to flog your tired corpse to three different jobs for 20 years with no relief in sight?

"They have 'syndics' on Anarres for every different job. You sign up for things. It's basically organized like a planetary IWW bureaucracy. Seems like anarcho-syndicalism to me. But yeah, it's not perfect. In my mind it is flawed and was done deliberately as an artistic device by Le Guin. I mean, I think if she wanted to she could have written it without those flaws as a well-oiled utopia where everything works perfectly, but she didn't. I can see two reasons why. 1. As a cautionary tale, basically seeing enough about humans and about anarchism to know where things would start to fail and to warn anarchist readers so they might learn from Anarres's mistakes. and 2. Because readers aren't into the idea of a perfect utopia. Writers use flaws to make things seem realistic. By putting flaws into the society she makes the world seem like a real world and not just a manifesto.",t3_a9nny8,Anarchism

"  Poverty really is Sexist. Why? Because, no matter how you cut it – socially, economically, legally – girls and women who live in extreme poverty are being denied the opportunities that they deserve. Right now, women and girls living in the world’s poorest countries are less likely to bank the money they earn, own the land they work or get the education they need to thrive. None of us are equal until all of us are equal and we won’t stop campaigning until there’s justice for women and girls everywhere. Here are 25 stats that show why #PovertyisSexist: 1. Women aged 15+ make up 57% of new HIV/AIDS infections amongst adults in sub-Saharan Africa. 2. 3 in 4 adolescents (15-19 years old) newly infected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa are girls. 3. Nearly 750 million girls and women alive today around the world were married before the age of 18. Rates of child marriage have declined in wealthier populations, but high levels of child marriage persist amongst the world’s poorest populations. 4. Over 1 in 4 young women aged 20-24 have had a live birth in the world’s least developed countries. 5. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, half of births to adolescent mothers are not attended by skilled health personnel. 6. “Globally, girls aged 5–14 spend 550 million hours every day on household chores, 160 million more hours than boys their age spend.” 7. In sub-Saharan Africa, women make up only 23.6% of parliamentarians. 8. There is a 7% gender gap in access to bank accounts, which widens to 9% in developing countries. 9. In most countries, women earn 60-75% of men’s wages on average. 10. “In South Asia, over 80% of women in non-agricultural jobs are in informal employment, in sub-Saharan Africa, 74%, and in Latin America and the Caribbean, 54%.” 11. 79 of the economies studied in this report have laws that restrict the types of work women can do. 12. In most sub-Saharan countries, women spend at least 16 million hours a day collecting drinking water. Men spend around 6 million hours a day collecting drinking water. 13. During elections in fragile and transitional states, female voters are 4 times as likely to be targeted for intimation than male voters. 14. In Yemen, women make up 60% of the crop farming labour force. Less than 1% of landholders in Yemen are women. 15. Gender inequality costs the region of Asia and the Pacific nearly USD $80 billion a year. This is mostly due to gender gaps in employment and education. 16. In 18 economies covered by this report, wives can be legally prevented from working by their husbands. 17. In sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls spend roughly 40 billion hours a year collecting water—the equivalent of a year’s worth of labour by the entire workforce in France. 18. Of all maternal deaths, 99 percent occur in developing countries. 19. In sub-Saharan Africa, 45 percent fewer women than men have access to the Internet. 20. Of all still-births that happen in the world, 98 percent happen in low- and middle-income countries. 21. At current rates of progress, women in sub-Saharan Africa will have to wait more than 160 years before they have the same chances as women in rich countries of their babies being born alive. 22. In 155 of the 173 economies covered in this report have at least one law impeding women’s economic opportunities. 23. If current trends continue, by 2020 over 75% of women in developing countries still won’t be connected to the internet, compared to 63% of men 24. There are over 130 million girls out of school worldwide. In the world’s poorest countries, girls are out of school at a higher rate than boys. 25.

"I sort of agree with your sentiment, but often times hunters do a good job of conserving the environment because humans have already fucked it up so much that we need to regulate it ourselves in place of the natural predators that we killed. By hunting legally the person is given a specific animal that the area can basically spare because it's doing no good and is actually causing harm to the rest of its population. So if hunters didn't hunt, far more animals would be hurt. Somewhat ironically, hunters actually do a lot for the environment and donate more money to conservation than any group in America. As for the last part, the deer definitely has a far better chance than the human hunting it does. This is due to several reasons, but the main reason is that they can hear, see, and smell tens if not hundreds times better than we can. On top of that, hunters often miss. I've done a lot of research into the topic after making this post and I've come to the conclusion that hunting is sort of a necessary evil because if they didn't hunt, the ecosystem would be pretty fucked. I don't know much about Theodore Roosevelt but I think he was correct in saying “In a civilized and cultivated country, wild animals only continue to exist at all when preserved by sportsmen,The excellent people who protest against all hunting, and consider sportsmen as enemies of wildlife, are ignorant of the fact that in reality the genuine sportsman is by all odds the most important factor in keeping the larger and more valuable wild creatures from total extermination.” ",t3_a29xff,Anarchism

"The Spanish Maquis that preceded the French Maquis was made up of a lot more anarchists and other socialists who escaped into France, and would do small excursions across the border into northern Francoist Spain, and wage guerilla warfare. It included some pretty legendary dudes like Quico Sabaté, who used to be part of the CNT until the Spanish Civil War ended, and continued the insurgency afterwards until he died. Come around WWII, and a lot of those anti-fascist exiles from Spain residing in France took part in the French Maquis, though the French Maquis were more of a mixed bag ideologically. Though to me, I think that their fight was still a good one, even if they weren't all anarchists or leftists.

"Not a lawyer (or really, much of an anarchist these days), but fairly familiar with anti-boycott legislation. Generally speaking, anti-boycott laws fall into two categories (state and federal). **1.) Proposed federal legislation**, which extends existing prohibitions against complying with a foreign country's boycott of Israel. Backstory: In the 70's, the Arab League told businesses that in order to set up shop in Arab League countries (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.), they couldn't do business with Israel. As a result, a lot of US corporations (including Ford, McDonald's Nestle) started boycotting Israel not out of any political motivation, but simply because doing business with the Arab League was more profitable than selling to Israel. Attempting to limit economic coercion, the US passed a law in 1979 prohibiting companies from complying with a foreign country's boycott of Israel. (Many corporations chose to violate the law, and pay the ensuing fines, because it was still more profitable to do business with Arab League countries.) This law is still in effect today:  Fast-forward to today, and the UN and some its various subcommittees are attempting to institute a boycott on Israel. So, pro-Israeli groups are supporting a bill extending existing prohibitions against complying with a foreign country's boycott of Israel to one imposed by an international government organization (e.g. the UN). Since this law doesn't impact individual consumers (and the penalties have already been enforced for four decades), it's unlikely to be found unconstitutional. **2.) State laws**, which don't allow the hiring of contractors that boycott Israel. These laws are debatably unconstitutional. Government agencies typically aren't supposed to consider an individual's political views when making hiring decisions. (Obviously, government agencies can exercise some discretion on a per-candidate basis - but there's not supposed to be any blanket ban of particular views.) The exact nature of these laws varies on a state-by-state basis. Some states, like Kansas and Texas, passed clearly unconstitutional laws which will be struck down in court. Other states, like South Carolina, passed anti-boycott laws which require state contractors to not discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, gender, etc. when 'on the clock,' but let individuals do whatever they want on their own time. These versions are likely constitutional. TL;DR: There's no proposed or existing legislation making it illegal to criticize Israel, or boycott Israel as a consumer/individual. (However, certain proposed and existing legislation does apply a much narrower scope.) If you're looking to further understand the legal intricacies, I'd recommend checking out David Schraub's analysis (lawyer/UCLA professor) of the state and federal variants:  ",t3_a9l9cs,Anarchism

That being said, anarchism undoubtedly fall under what is traditionally called 'the Left.' It is against all hierarchies, including those of capitalism, tradition, and nationalism. It does not approach humans based on merit or heritage, but on a very fundamental equality and love for others. It focuses on community-building and mutual aid, rather than wishing to exclude people for arbitrary reasons. Because of all that, anarchism is much closer to the modern Left than the modern Right.

"Wikipedia's organizational structure is complex. The first and most important thing to emphasize is that there's really two structures. First, there's the volunteer editors; then there's the founder, Jimbo Wales, and the Wikimedia foundation, who actually *own* the website (since ultimately it does exist in a capitalist context.) The Wikimedia foundation obviously has the final say, but in practice, at the moment, they only get involved over legal issues; and just about anything they do is extremely controversial. Jimbo Wales similarly retains, on paper, a bunch of odd ad-hoc powers, not unlike the Queen of England; and, like the Queen of England, he couldn't realistically use most of them without the website tearing it apart and doing serious damage to the project. (eg. he notionally has the power to dissolve the Arbitration Committee - more on that in a moment - but doing so would, practically speaking, be blowing up Wikipedia.) In practice, for anything that isn't a pressing legal issue that the community has failed to address, the actual day-to-day decision-making structure of Wikipedia is handled by volunteers. Roughly speaking: 1. Consensus on a particular article decides the content of that article, although local consensus like that cannot override the rules. Consensus is established through discussion and, when that breaks down, by a Request for Comment. In practice, on less-trafficked articles, people can just add what they want unless someone objects, and disputes are often resolved by who gets bored first. 2. Wikipedia-wide rules are similarly established by consensus on the rules pages, but making any significant change is more difficult and requires more protracted discussion - a request for comment for a major rules change is almost essential. 3. A Request for Comment is a procedure where you ask the community's opinion on something. It's broadcast from a central page to attract attention, and everyone who notices and cares weighs in with brief one-sentence or one-paragraph opinion one way or the other. The RFC is then closed by an uninvolved user (in controversial or close cases this is usually an admin.) RFCs are emphatically *not* votes (people sometimes jokingly refer to their comments there as '!votes'), but in practice if there's a significant majority on one side, a closer who wanted to rule against them would have to be able to make a *very* convincing case that either their arguments are totally against the rules, or there's substantial vote-stacking or other shenanigans; otherwise it would quickly get overturned. Also note that an RFC isn't 'final'; it can be overturned later on by a new consensus. 4. Admins are !voted in via a procedure similar to RFCs, except the threshold is generally considered to be higher and it's closed by a bureaucrat. (Bureaucrats are super-admins to an extent, but in practice the position grants no particular authority beyond promoting admins - they can't even demote them. Most of the time the outcome of a Request for Adminship is completely obvious, so the bureaucrat role is as boring as the name implies - they don't settle disputes.) 5. Admins have a few other powers - when the Arbitration Committee has allowed it in a particular topic area, they can impose certain sanctions and restrictions on an article to defuse long-running conflicts, and they can ban people for misconduct. Aside from assessing the consensus of RFCs, however, they are specifically *not* allowed to use their powers to weigh in on 'content' issues, only 'conduct' issues. Also, I should add in passing that there are a *lot* of admins - over a thousand of them - which somewhat dilutes the power of any one administrator. 6. The Arbitration Committee is the closest thing to a 'top tier' on the volunteer side - they're essentially the Wikipedia supreme court. They're voted in by the community for rotating terms. (Unlike RFCs and RFAs, this is an actual closed-ballot vote; ballot-stuffing is prevented by the fact that you have to be an established account with a certain number of edits to vote.) As with admins, their role is to conduct, never article content, but they also make some decisions regarding how to interpret and implement rules and policies. The role is a huge amount of work for no pay, so despite the notional power they wield it's often difficult to get people to even run for the job. That covers the overall structure, but it's important to underline the role that Wikipedia's culture plays in making this all run smoothly. When I say that administrators and the arbitration committee don't use their powers to decide content disputes, I mean that seriously; even the slightest hint of that raises massive scandals (and while it's usually extremely difficult to actually remove an administrator, this is one of the things that can make it happen.) Part of what makes it all work is the fact that the vast majority of established editors, admins, arbitrators and bureaucrats agree to the basic principles behind the encyclopedia and recognize that allowing them to be violated could endanger the entire project.",t3_a7gom0,Anarchism

It's a weaponization of 'let those without sin cast the first stone' by claiming that people who would criticize liberal society are automatically hypocrites because they live in that society.

I think our strategy should take multiple forms, anything from dialogue, starting cooperatives, unionizing, creating communes to direct action can be useful. We should slowly build a network that gains strength over time until it is strong enough to fight the state in a general insurrection and sustain its members. You mentioned Canadian Aborigines in your post, and while I know I need to learn a lot more about decolonization and anarchism, you can draw a lot of parallels with Canadian Aborigines and anarchism. For instance, there were several groups in Canada which had anarchist societies, ranging from gatherer-hunters to semi-urban groups. These are: Niitsitapi:  Nishnaabeg:  Inuit:  Haudennosaunne:  In the modern day, there have been several anarchisty actions undertaken by the descendents of some of those groups. Including... The Unist'ot'en Camp:  The Mi'kmaq anti-fracking movement:  The Oka Crisis:  Also, some have argued that the 2012 Quebec Student Movement had a strongly anarchist character.  Some have also pointed to the government of Nunavut as something anarchists can appreciate.  Let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer.

There could be some natural hierarchy, due to people having different levels of knowledge and experience in a given field. Of course people should listen to them who know their stuff and that creates some level of hierarchy I believe. These ''natural authorities'' should never be put in a position where they make the decisions themselves, of course. All big decisions should be made after all people have been heard. There could be some kind of council that could make minor decisions without having to hear everybody every time, as it's very time consuming. But it should be made sure, that these people can always be monitored and changed when necessary.

Auschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941.

"Fuck escapism. Distraction in the face of temporary overwhelming emotions can be helpful but only to the extent that it gives those emotions time to return to base level, where you can think clearly and be effective. Beyond that, it's the least effective thing you can do. It's less effective at building revolution than it would be to actively work against revolution, I think. Learn to find the dialectic between acceptance and change. Radicals tend to think in extremes, where all things, people, ideas etc are either right or wrong, good or bad, one or the other. Learn to identify and take the middle way. Dialectics is where the thesis and antithesis come together to form the synthesis, which then becomes or leads to a new thesis. Here: Capitalism leaves me feeling unfulfilled (thesis) but I have to have money to survive (antithesis). Emotion says fuck it I'll act on my feelings and do something self destructive. Reason says escapism suppressing your emotional needs. Some syntheses here (there are already a few in other comments but not many) might be to get a job that helps the disempowered at least a little more than the rulers; to get a job you can at least stand that you can also put energy into revolutionary projects; to take a stance of patience and regardless of work, take concrete steps to prepare yourself and your community for the world of climate catastrophe that we're rushing into.

"**Laurriaux, Aude. 4 December 2018. . [English: What the polls reveal about the identity of the 'yellow vests'.] Slate.fr.** There is obviously a disclaimer at the beginning of the article because of the inherent uncertainty of the data (for one, there hasn't been enough time to do a proper sociodemographic study). But it especially relies on Jérôme Fourquet, director of the department of opinion polling and enterprise strategy at the popular French polling agency Ifop. There is also data provided by other agencies and individuals. It doesn't just cover who they voted for, the aims to paint a general portrait of the yellow vests and their supporters. It generally distinguishes between data from interviewed protesters, data from people who specifically identify as 'yellow vest' and have done something to signal that, and the broader public. If we discard the broader public and just look at the first two categories: >À la présidentielle 2017, pour qui ont voté les «gilets jaunes»? Très clairement, ce sont d’abord et avant tout des électeurs et électrices de Marine Le Pen (à 42%). Les personnes ayant choisi d'autres candidats au premier tour sont bien plus frileuses: celles qui ont voté pour Jean-Luc Mélenchon se revendiquent à 20% «gilets jaunes», pour François Fillon à 16%, et pour Benoît Hamon et Emmanuel Macron, à 9% et 5% respectivement. Translation: >Who did the 'yellow vests' vote for at the 2017 presidential election? Very clearly, it is first and foremost voters of Marine Le Pen (at 42%). The people who chose other candidates in the first round [of the election] are much more cautious: those who voted for Jean-Luc Mélenchon represent 20% of the 'yellow vests', Francois Fillon 16% and Benoît Hamon and Emmanual Macron 9% and 5%, respectively. They say that this difference is negated almost entirely when you include the opinion of the broader public (i.e. not protesters and not people who openly identified as 'yellow vests' in polls etc.): * 91% supporters of Le Pen's Rassemblement National, known as the Front National in the 2017 election, support it. * 86% of the supporters of Mélenchon's La France Insoumise (LFI) support it. The data in the article aligns well with the description given by a professor researching French society at the University of Copenhagen in a newspaper article published online by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. He claimed it's almost entirely people from the parties of Le Pen and Mélenchon (both of which are pretty authoritarian, mind).",t3_a67p5f,Anarchism

">The symbolism of the “yellow vest” is not trivial. It refers to the obligation dating from a few years back to have a yellow vest and a warning triangle in one’s vehicle, which had already caused the discontent of the average driver. At that time, he was no more concerned about social struggles than today. His demands were only immediate, without social thought behind, without envy of another world, without hatred of the current. The same is true today with the rattle of purchasing power. What the “yellow vests” want is not a break but, on the contrary, to continue to perpetuate this world, to be able to continue to participate. How can this be interesting? >For many people participating in this movement, this is their first “mobilisation”. Where were they in 2006, 2010, 2016, to pick up only the biggest social movements of recent years? This is not to say that because they did not participate in these social movements (even despised them), we should not participate in their movement, but rather to realise that our perspectives differ. from what they seem to aspire. Just as the prospects emanating from the “Day of Wrath” prevented us from intervening, we see no reason for the prospects of this movement to incite us to act on it. Literally their criticism is just that the yellow jackets aren’t woke professional activists like they are. Hard to imagine a more pointless thing to say. I think it’s great if people like this feel “uncomfortable” at no longer being the center of the movement. These are the same people who were trying to call off the strike in ‘68.

There are many niches in anarchism and many different anarchists; no one speaks for all “as an anarchist” I’ll try to answer as best I can but not an authority or expert (attempting or claiming to be so would be antithetical to anarchism) Some may be extreme either in ideology, semantics, or praxis, and the very definition of what extreme is is relative For instance, Bob Black doesn’t consider Noam Chomsky to be an anarchist but a left wing Marxist, so he’s very particular in his definition On the other hand, David Graeber makes the case that most people are actually anarchists, which is the interpretation I prefer So if you ask me personally if I think I’m extreme, my answer is no, since I think most people are Anarchist but they just don’t realize it 2. I don’t think it’s good or bad to be extreme/fringe or not; it depends on the person/situation 3.

"**Operation Paperclip** Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely carried out by Special Agents of Army CIC, in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were recruited, after the end of World War II, in Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders, of the Nazi Party.The primary purpose for Operation Paperclip was U.S. military advantage in the Soviet–American Cold War, and the Space Race. The Soviet Union were more aggressive in forcibly recruiting more than 2,200 German specialists—a total of more than 6,000 people including family members—with Operation Osoaviakhim during one night on October 22, 1946.The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established the first secret recruitment program, called Operation Overcast, on July 20, 1945, initially 'to assist in shortening the Japanese war and to aid our postwar military research'. The term 'Overcast' was the name first given by the German scientists' family members for the housing camp where they were held in Bavaria. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a86c1c,Anarchism

"I wholeheartedly agree with you. But I naively (and afaics) only slightly criticised idpol a couple of times on /r/Anarchism and got flamed like crazy for basically being a racist, trans-phobic etc. because it offended a number of people that had obviously suffered deeply (and genuinely, not just nonsense like Halloween costumes) and wanted, and seemed to deserve, individual attention and sympathy. No one wants to shut down people that have been genuinely hurt and continue to suffer our living nightmare of structural violence. And once someone has suffered you can't say 'get over yourself and unite with us' to remove the root cause of all our problems (which is the state, and structural violence). I think part of the problem is that (at least in the US), the revolution is currently (hopefully briefly) stalled, and as soon as it gets going even deeply injured people will naturally focus on the excitement of rebellion and idpol will start evaporating. The thing is to put the revolution in gear and get it going. I think if that happens it will be surprising how many people rise up and stop licking their wounds.

"A precondition for anarchist societies would that people are generally down with the program. Program meaning developing a free and fair way of organizing society and economic relations that eliminates structural and systemic forms of oppression. Given this shared goal and collective commitment to care about the broader and inclusive society, I trust that communities would figure out many different ways of making it work. Since we have a shared goal of advancing collective and inclusive interests, anarchist societies would highly value infrastructure since everyone depends on and benefits from good infrastructure. In some communities there might be a water and sanitation collective of people who work on maintaining water and sewage. When something breaks they would just fix it, because its their job and because they are down with the program. For new infrastructure projects the community may have some form of collective decision making to identify priorities for new projects based on the needs of the community. This decision making process would include mechanisms to ensure fair and equitable access to new infrastructure again in line with the shared goal of maintaining a free and fair society. But this is just one way I can imagine that a community would keep the toilets flushing. If it turns out there’s an issue with this system, we can just change it, borrowing models from neighboring communities who have different ways of organizing water and sanitation. I would argue that no anarchist can give a definitive micromanaged answer, because how we do things in an anarchist society would be figured out collectively and we could just change the way we do things to improve our processes, organizations and communities. This sounds very abstract, but in practice people are pretty effective at looking out for each other, particularly when they are self organized rather than directed by state or corporate agents. When there is a serious problem or disaster people generally chip in to help each other. An anarchist supposition is that liberated from capitalism and the state, our capacity to look out for each other would be a basis for organizing free and fair communities.",t3_a5jyg3,Anarchism

Ethical and legal are completely separate things—therefore, there are no good cops as they are required to enforce unethical laws. Are there decent individuals that become cops? Of course. However, the institution of policing means police officers, by default, are oppressors by occupation—meaning there truly are no good active-duty cops.... A conscious cop would think about quitting..... All cops oppress poor people and are therefore evil. All cops make threats of death and are therefore evil.... Dismantling the institution of policing does not mean anarchy in the context of chaos.

"My reply was short, and I can see how it was easy to read a lot of meaning into it that simply wasn't there. This may be an ongoing discussion within your circle, and there are probably large cultural differences between us. Mostøy because I grew up, and live in Norway, in places with relatively low racism and high levels of plurality. I. e. I grew up with a bunch of people who looked different, from lots of different backgrounds and cultures, without that really being an issue at the time. (It's become more of an issue since, with the right wing gaining a majority, but our right is still mostly essentially left of the DNP) I'm not saying race isn't a cultural issue. It definitely is. I'm saying it's a dumb one, based on ridiculous overgeneralization based on relatively small differences in genetic code. Yes, there is also a fairly recent use of the term that encompasses cultural bigotry, because anyone Not White™ (and this is particularly in the US) have had ghettoified (i. e. closed off) living conditions and built a culture of their own. That is to say, certain cultures are associated with the afroamerican community not because they are afroamerican, but because they've been treated as different by those in power. It's worth noting that historically this once included the irish. Now, using the ideas of materialist philosophy and class difference to look at *that* is relevant, without that denying that skin-colour, speech, culture etc are used as short-hand for someone being 'wrong'. In fact, that wrong-ness is what makes it relevant. Appearing white and being rich or poor is qualitatively different from appearing Not White™ and being rich or poor. Now, me? I'm a bi leftie white guy veteran and student politician on the board of directors at my university in Norway. One of the safest countries in the world if you don't count the weather/nature. I don't even have to pay (much) to get an education. I am, by body weight, like 90% privilege and 10% gradually receding hairline. So yeah, I know. And yes, I get what you're saying. Growing up relatively poor in a rich country, and the veteran part means I have some small experience with having my identity defined for me by someone else. I still don't know what growing up like that based on something intrinsic to me would be like. I can't pretend to - bit I try to listen, and understand, and as humans we are, ultimately, capable of understanding somebody elses lived experience. At least a little. That's what art is for. Anyway, I'm rambling now. Point is, we're on the same team here, and while I appreciate the educational spirit, the inherently divisive (you vs us) rhetoric is still harmful to the cause. It feels good, because it is true to a point about one aspect of experience, but it doesn't gain allies. I suspect that may be the issue parts of your left have - the old ideas of class struggle relies on an 'us vs them' mentality that relies on position in society more than anything else - and fighting an opponent that by definition has the upper hand.. There is a need for unity. Of course, the goal is the same.. People being treated well, equally and with respect, a reshaping of the status quo to a place where poor families whatever their background have enough to live with dignity.

"Well if you are pre-supposing that this exact situation (or something fairly analogous) could still happen in an effective (or at least salvageable) anarchist society, then the smart solution that would actually approach this guy as a human being instead of a beast (which the prison system fails in doing) would be some form of guided immersion therapy. Dude hates liberals? Make him live in a liberal commune for a year. Dude hates women? Make him plant gardens with Eco-Feminists. These kinds of solutions honestly couldn’t hurt this guy in any true tangible or emotional way, and I’m sure the success rate wouldn’t be stellar, but it still would be better than the current prison system. It’s also important to uncover and address the social and environmental aspects of this person’s life that would lead him to commit such a heinous act, because in a truly anarchist society, civilization must always be reorganized and systematically adapted to minimize (if not completely eliminate) any suffering that could snowball into grander suffering. If this guy had a shitty life due to systemic poverty, and Neo-Nazis offered him pride in himself, which actually allowed his mind to logically excuse and execute some wrathful urge in him, ‘well then shit we should really solve this systemic poverty problem’.

"Ok I’ll do my best to answer your questions, as an anarchist speaking for myself of course. 1. I do not really think of myself as an extremist because I think my political views are reasonable. Given that I acknowledge that my views diverge significantly from prevailing ones. Despite this I can have a conversation with a lot of regular people who can agree with me about some relatively extreme views,such as it would be better if the workers here owned and managed this company themselves. 2. I understand that the corporate media, politicians, and liberals will demonize my views as extremist. I just expect that. Historically many, probably most, people advocating for radical change were cast as extremists by the powers that be. Accused of being an extremist, Martin Luther King Jr. asked “but was not Jesus an extremist for love.” (Letter from a Birmingham Jail). 3. There are some aspects of capitalism that I just find to be abhorrent. Liberal democracy is structurally corrupt and oppressive. I object to all forms of systematic oppression. That said, I’m less interested in hating on anything and more invested in advocating for more free and fair ways of doing things. I am a critic of capitalism because I believe it is structurally flawed and I believe we can do better. 4. I do vote. I just consider that act as about as politically significant as deciding which brand of tofu I buy. Organizing is far more important. 5. The corporate media will pretty much exclusively frame anarchists in the context of spectacular public demonstrations. And to be fair, I’ll watch videos of burning cop cars like it’s porn. That said, I do not consider property destruction to be violent. If a person is harmed or threatened with harm that’s violent, and I believe we have the right to defend ourselves by any means necessary. Capitalism is a brutally violent system.

"I mean you are kind of talking in only black and white when its a more nuanced issue. Depends on what you define as violence and what you consider an appropriate reason to use it. Is burning a car with no one in it more or less violent than killing a bug? Sure one has more economic value but the other is a life being taken away, it gets way too deep into philosphy to come to any conclusions. Most advocates of non-violence and pacifism I've dealt with make exceptions for defence, and would consider someone who would willingly die to avoid a confrontation extreme. Do you think defending yourself is violence? How about burning stuff? Plus what counts as self defence, do we only count action against clear and direct threats as self defence, like fighting off a mugger? Or are more abstract threats actionable too?

"While this is technically true, it's worth noting that it's almost never that simple. There are hundreds of thousands of people doing individual actions towards the greater good every day...there are also hundreds of thousands of people doing individual actions towards *their* good every day irrespective of its impact on others that bend the moral arc of the universe waaaay the fuck back. It is basically impossible to foresee what impact your actions may or may not have on the world around you and going into *anything* with the thought process of 'my contribution will be part of the multitude that pushes towards change' is an excellent way to end up burned out and frustrated. How do I know this? Because I went through it and I've seen half a dozen other activists go through it, I see people in the various stages of grief once they start realizing that their actions have amounted to zero at best. That's assuming one's actions were even benign. What do you do when you realize something you've been doing for a decade thinking it had a positive impact on the world actually had a *negative* one? Either directly or indirectly. Yeah you saved paper by using reusable shopping bags but you just recently learned that the material investment and pollution generated by manufacturing reusable bags actually makes them *more* damaging to the environment than paper in most cases. With the thought that 'I am part of something, no matter how small I am' there's generally an expectation that that something will start doing...something. You expect to feel some kind of momentum or change. When it doesn't happen, it magnifies feelings of insignificance and powerlessness that most of us grapple with just by virtue of being human. Change doesn't necessarily come for them because there are a lot of other people and things acting in opposition to them. Looking at the world this way is a shortcut to nihilism and apathy. That's the road most people with this attitude I've seen go down. It sure as shit was the road I was on for a while. At the end of the day, you kinda have to be comfortable with the fact that we're in a pretty trash world right now and there is basically nothing you as an individual can do that's going to change that for the better, no matter how hard you want it. It's a lot better for your own mental and emotional health to recognize your situation and either try and change it if it doesn't help you or to accept it and deal with it in healthy ways. What I've found to be most effective is just try to keep being positive, try to give back more than I take, try to be a positive force in the lives of people that I know, try not to feed into negativity, try to be understanding and supportive of others, and recognize the relationships of other people in the world. I realize that sounds super TED Talk-y but it helps get rid of that feeling of being powerless because you know at the end of the day that you've done your best to make the world that is accessible to you better than you found it. And the bonus is you often get to see results, you see people who are happy to know you, who value your friendship and thoughts, you see people you care about doing well and people in bad situations have their situations improve.

Contrary to what western propaganda has told you the definition of socialism is, I think the two are actually rather mutually exclusive. The possibility of social mobility (at the expense of others) in capitalism only highlights even more the reality of class separation and struggle in society. Social mobility is the path to increasing your influence in a capitalist society. A top down system. It is entirely based around self interest and therefore is inevitably corrupt. The only thing free about capitalism is the freedom to exploit others for your own benefit. It’s completely dependent on the state to exist and therefore cannot separate itself from corruption.

"There are lots of reasons to oppose things that don't come down to judgments about morality—or even ethics. Oppression has material consequences, most of which are a lot more immediately relevant to our daily lives than the question of whether or not they conform to some abstract standard of right and wrong. Anti-authoritarians necessarily begin by rejecting many, even most, of the systems of morality that have been imposed on human beings. So being against all sorts of specific sorts of morality is essential to being an anarchist. The question then becomes whether or not there is anything worth calling 'morality' that is not ultimately an appeal to authority. ",t3_aa7opl,Anarchism

"Capitalism only grants authority over ones self, and ownership over ones property. In no place does it grant authority over human beings, which is what separates it from the feudalism. state socialism, etc. Personal possessions and capitalist property relationships are not the same thing. Possessions are things people use, property has no use except to extract wealth from workers by giving them permission to work. A car is a possession, a fleet of cars run via wage labor is property. The capitalist contributes nothing but giving others permission to perform labor. Any organizational labor the capitalist contributes is incidental, and in fact in a large corporation can easily be assigned to a subordinate if the owner does not want to do any labor at all. We can only agree if we both define capitalism as 'the voluntary exchange of goods and services between individuals' That’s not capitalism. The voluntary exchange of goods and services in a market is an anti-capitalist system called mutualism. In that system workplaces are owned and operated by workers. Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production. This ownership is profited on through rent-seeking and wage labor. It is not voluntary due to the massive power imbalance between rulers and workers. By your loose definition of tyranny, nature is a tyrant, forcing early human beings to toil and labor for centuries, with little in return other than a minimal sustenance? This is again an argument that could be used to defend feudalism just as easily. “It’s not my fault you’ll starve if you fail to labor on my land, peasant.” Getting to choose which boot steps on your throat under capitalism is an improvement compared to feudalism, but I don’t consider it desirable. I define tyrant as someone with authority over other humans backed by violence, which is why to me the words criminal, and state are almost interchangeable. In capitalist hierarchies, participation is voluntary, making the word tyranny an inaccurate description. The negotiating power of a worker is far weaker than that of a capitalist in nearly all cases, so there is nothing voluntary about it. A negotiation where one person dies if they don’t agree and the other loses nothing is not voluntary. And since an economy can’t be made predominately of independent artisans, that vast majority do have to choose a capitalist to exploit their labor for profit. Or just take whatever job they can get to not die and put up with any indignity or degradation they experience. Non-voluntary, or coerced exchanges are invalid, and are what define authoritarianism/totalitarianism. To me this means no human has the rights to the labor, or property of another without that humans content. But why does anyone own property? (Keeping in mind property and possession are not the same.) You make it sound like capitalist property ownership is the cosmic order of the universe when it is an entirely arbitrary human invention. All useful land on this planet has been stolen and stolen again many times. Many capitalists contribute absolutely nothing to society their whole lives but inherit property. Many who own property have violated the NAP. Why should workers endure a parasite class because pieces of paper say some random person gets to decide how their environment is polluted, how they are allowed to live, and so forth? And corporations have been known to dictate even tiny minutia of people’s lives on the threat of losing one’s job. If the government tells you you’re not allowed to drink large sodas, you would rightfully say it is tyranny. But if your employer pushes the same rule, it is legitimate because you can find another job? Never mind that finding another job is difficult and risky for most workers, and the vast majority of workplaces will mistreat workers in one way or another. One might as well make the argument that ability to move to a different state negates the abuses of any one state. Disagree, hierarchy creates predictable patterns in society that would otherwise be more chaotic. Not that chaos is a bad thing, but organizing into hierarchies is by definition not an 'engine for chaos'. That's why most Ancaps advocate for a private/voluntary rights enforcement mechanisms for enforcing individual rights. Hierarchies create strong incentives to viciously compete, as humans strongly value safety and those at the bottom of political and economic hierarchies have little of that. If you give people incentive to be vicious and break rules and then think some enforcement mechanism will prevent this you will be disappointed. Feudal lords tried this, socialist dictators tried this, western democracies tried this, and they are all inherently unstable. Capitalists republics become dictatorships, tyrannical state socialism leads to tyrannical capitalism, wars and destruction of the environment are the only constant. Every generation of humans says to themselves, “things are terrible now, but if we get better leaders and/or change how we select leaders I’m sure it will be alright.” And for thousands of years this approach has failed because the problem is leadership itself. Power addicts most of those who wield it and degrades everyone subjected to it. Every hierarchical system has enforcement mechanisms to try to force people who have massive incentive not to follow the rules to follow the rules. Asking capitalists to voluntarily follow and help enforce the NAP at the cost of profits is no more likely to work that asking the king to please think of what is best for his people. This assumes nobody enjoys their work, or professional accomplishments, or that nobody is entrepreneurial, or self employed. Granted, unskilled labor is rough, and doesn't pay much, but the further one ventures toward highly skilled in a desirable career, or entrepreneurial in nature the more ones labor enriches themselves. This is another argument that could be used in favor of feudalism. Do you think feudal peasants hated their lives and never found any pleasure or accomplishment in their labor? If that had been true, feudalism would not have last for centuries. Even peasants can find plenty things to be happy about, but the human ability to persevere despite tyranny does not justify capitalism. I have no desire to be a capitalist, or a worker. Nor do I want to be an independent artisan in a world where capitalists or statists own all the land and I must follow every one of their rules to be allowed to continue to exist. If I die in a gulag because I offended the party or get blacklisted and kicked out of a company town because I offended the owner, I’m just as dead.",t3_a8j9ia,Anarchism

"I'm here as an ego-check on the anarchists here because this thread is a circle-jerk waiting to happen. I'm an anarchist. I think it's quite clear that most anarchists look down on other people, and not just people with different strong political opinions (like Marxists). Anarchists tend to think they are much better people than others, even when they are assholes. They think they have society figured out and if only people would listen to them, things would be fine. As to the latter point, this is how most people with strong political opinions think. Anarchists look down on Marxists as much as is true vice versa. Many anarchists think that Marxists/Marxism have nothing to offer, even if they are woefully ignorant of Marxism, knowing only that the USSR was bad and Marxists can be dogmatic. Marxists can be annoying, but I think anarchists should get into the habit of trying to overcome their own deficiencies rather than leaning on the crutch of complaining about Marxists.

"First of all once mob mentality takes over, things are smashed indiscriminately, I’ve had friends entire mom and pop shop businesses looted and destroyed. So while a Starbucks might be one target, that is by no means a fair representation of what really happens. Yup. It's true that you can't fully control the form that anger takes once it's unleashed. So it might be a good idea if these fucking capitalists would stop making society into a simmering pot of repressed anger. Secondly, a luxury car is subjective, and you have no idea what the circumstances are behind the ownership of that vehicle. The person who owns it could be in a mountain of debt to it, it could be a lease, it could be someone really loves cars and saved up for years for it, it could have irreplaceable family photos or other important items in it. It could end up catching a house nearby on fire and hurt or kill people. I should feel bad because someone has internalized bad values to the point that he threw his life away for a chunk of metal? Shouldn't that be balanced by the people already living in an area who have the right to continue to do so without yuppie chain businesses gentrifying the place to bring in the luxury car daily-drivers? For that matter, why does our luxury car lover not have comprehensive coverage? Someone might be pregnant and come out to rush to the hospital only to find their vehicle destroyed. The lack of humanity and thought behind doing that to someone is unfathomable and completely undermines any noble intention you think you may have. Good thing hospitals have emergency vehicles specifically for extracting medical emergency patients and bringing them to qualified carers, otherwise pregnant women would be popping like balloons because cars don't start sometimes. Not to mention the environmental impact of destroying things that will just be replaced with causing all the same impact to be repeated. I just don’t get how you don’t get that. You're completely right. It's not as if car manufacturers keep vomiting out new models every fucking year whether people need them or not. They specifically only make cars on request, so if cars are never destroyed by pesky anarchists, the environment will be saved. Hooray! This idea that some time from the past was better is a fantasy. Good thing I don't have that idea. We have police because there are shitty people out there who will kill you and rape your wife just for the fun of it. If you think that if we could just kill capitalism, that everyone would all of a sudden play nice and we don’t need police any more, than you have clearly never looked into the eyes of really bad people. Unfortunately I have. They exist. Some form of policing is necessary. No, . Literally. And what am I doing while these bad criminals are running around slapping people? What is my wife doing? What are my neighbors doing? What is my dog doing? Are we all just waiting patiently for our slaps because we're incapable of handling conflicts without an agent of the state present? And back to taking about the British empire and progress, like that was then, you can’t compare it today. We can’t keep looking to the past and cherry picking all the fun stuff, reframed and romanticized. We live in a technological dream scape right now the likes never before seen in history. The past can’t help us. We need to evolve not revolve. To build on top of and fix what we have, not destroy. You understand the difference between learning from history and repeating history, don't you? The lesson that free knowledge-sharing leads to faster progress than gating it behind corporations and pay-journals is as applicable today as it ever has been -- even more applicable, since there are mountains of knowledge that have accumulated since that time. Even the Starbucks you smash, you think your fighting for the cause but in reality your just destroying someones place of employment, taking out of work inflating insurance premiums. The real effects of those actions effect real peoples lives and they don’t help anyone. It’s not like you’re sticking around offering people new jobs or alternative means of supporting themselves. You just smash it up and then run away. You think you can support yourself on a Starbucks wage? No, hang on, don't leave. Let me genuinely try to engage with your argument. I should care about Starbucks because if I smash that window, the Starbucks owner will be victimized by *another* exploitative capitalist who'll raise his insurance premiums? I shouldn't smash Starbucks because then the Starbucks employees will be oppressed by their landlords and student loans and giant for-profit grocery chains, three more institutions I want to smash? And all of this aggressive behaviour has the attitude of forcing your ideology upon the masses with violence, so how is that different from fascism? Off the top of my head?

(Which goes against all the research and factual evidence that's been collected for decades). I honestly refuse to help them or educate them in anyway. Especially as a black man. I refuse to help white nationalists and their sympathizers by giving them the knowledge needed to become leftists. Besides, there's a reason why a historian called us 'The United States of Amnesia'.

"After reading one of his books and learning from several other experts (Gabor Mate, Adrian Raine etc), I believe the theory of justice argued by James Gilligan is correct. Here is a very, very brief introduction to his stance:  Dangerous people have to be locked up. Unfortunately with our current limitations in neuropharmacology, that's just unavoidable. But they can still live out dignified, humane lives and they can provide a wealth of information to neuroscientists and psychologists. This is how they can pay their debt to society. If we have incorrect forensic/eyewitness evidence or some other mishap, the wrongfully convicted will not have suffered for however long it took to reveal their innocence. They will not have permanent brain damage from isolation and lack of stimulation. It still isn't fair, but it's a lot better. Restraining violent people is also to *protect them*. If someone is a known killer and they're allowed to live freely, perhaps in exile, someone may seek revenge; victim or vigilante citizen. We are protecting all parties from vengeance, especially in the nightmare scenario where you kill/torture someone that turns out to be innocent years later. ",t3_a5asny,Anarchism

"The way I read Dispossessed is that those 'discrepancies' you list regarding their society are the whole problem that Shevek sets out to address, and the whole point of the book. Yes, I would say that Anarres is an anarchist / communist society but isn't able to fully realize that potential because they live constantly under the shadow of Urras. How can an anarchist society truly blossom when the laborious, dangerous extraction of a single resource is the only thing staving off invasion from an entire hostile planet? How can you flourish in a hostage situation? That single discrepancy, that single point of anxiety, is able to ripple out through the entirety of Annares society and infect all sorts of social relations. After his dealings with slimy Sabul, after hearing about Tirin's brutal treatment through [the fucking woke] Bedap, Shevek comes to realize that Annares will never be a utopia so long as all of their relations are forced eventually down the line to poison themselves by way of the coercive threat from Urras. Of course, this issue isn't resolved over the course of the book, as huge societal changes of that nature do not follow the plot of a single person. Le Guin liked to zoom in on a specific moment in the massive 10,000 year chronology of her fictional human history to points of fluctuation which we can assume ripple out over decades or centuries or millennia after the last page of the written story. [SPOILERS] We can assume that after his contact with the Terran embassy on Urras and return to Annares with his new Hain companion, Shevek uses his knowledge of the ansible to help kick off a long process of power struggle and reconciliation between the worlds. You can imagine it turning into a long and violent war, or being resolved swiftly and diplomatically, but I think the implication at the end of the book is that we witnessed the beginning of the resolution of 'One big hangup' on Annares. PS I coincidentally finished Left Hand of Darkness last week, similar sort of plot there.

There are other reasons people are so reflexively against violence but i think all of the above inclines people to treat the immediate symptom as the problem instead of its causes.

"So as far as it's being portrayed by relatively neutral conventional news sources (Reueters), the crux of these actions is Macron raising gas prices. The crimethinc article seems to corroborate that - and part of their support for the movement's rhetoric seems to stem from the argument that environmentalism in the context of democratic government gives a platform to nationalists. I have been really trying to find an angle from which to support the yellow vest thing. But where I keep landing is that raising gas prices is a pretty stupid thing to riot over. Don't get me wrong, I am definitely behind fighting the cops. But I also think that as long as there's liberal democracy (in the classical sense) governing nations, I would rather they keep gas prices high than subsidize them. Especially in places with adequate public transportation, which much of Europe has (at least moreso than the US). At least it fucking keeps people out of their cars. In my experience 95% of people will bitch about high gas prices, and of those, 90% should fucking drive less anyway. And the argument that centrist or liberal environmentalism is garbage is fine, but the argument that it's worse because it gives nationalists room to capitalize on it doesn't really hold, logically. And it definitely seems like these protests are being used as a springboard for fascists and right-wing populists to foment dissent in their favor.

That said Trotskyists can be ok (differnt groups can be quite different), generally they like Lenin but not Stalin, they sometimes do some decent work - but they are still authoritarians.

We have very limited resources. Even our time. Two anarchists, who are already so few, spending their precious time and energy arguing with each other. Successful political movements haven't come from gatekeeping, elitism, and blind belief in ideological correctness. Nazis are my enemy. Nazi-enablers are my enemies, but it's possible for some to be my friend, or at the very least to neutralize them as a hostile force. Awkward neckbeards are not my primary enemy. They are actually my ally, because they also believe anarchists should be protected. Here's the thing dude, in the American system, if Nazis aren't allowed, anarchists shouldn't be either. Neither of us are operating with the end goal being some minor electoral shift. The end game is to undermine the system itself and to turn it into something entirely new. To depart from the legal system, the financing system, and even the fucking food chain! That is NOT compatible with liberal democracy, it's literally hostile to it. So if there is a group WITHIN the liberal democracy who will advocate for me, no, I'm not going to go full dipshit and start calling them Nazis. Literally basic diplomacy. Don't unessearily insult people and escalate situations. /Especially/ when you are /massively outnumbered, outgunned, and out-financed./ That's just basic common sense.

"I believe Kropotkin does a good job of analyzing our modern productive capacity (100 laborers can now feed and shelter 10,000, etc), even as long ago as the 1800s.

I'm probably not the same age as your friend, but I am fairly anti-theistic and I LOVE scifi and cosmology too. But I also look for 'irrefutable' arguments when it comes to politics/philosophy and Malatesta's *Anarchy* was the first book to be so concise that I started calling myself anarchist. Before that book I'd say I was also basically social democrat.

"Your view is essentially taken, in one way or another, from John Stuart Mill’s essay, On Liberty, and is part of what he calls the harm principle. Everything is fine so long as you aren’t harming anyone else. He goes on to argue that in an “open” (read: liberal) society, there should be absolute free expression of speech because, as you said, by expressing their views, people with bigoted ideas will be presented with an alternative and shown that their views can have a negative impact on others. And by getting all ideas out in the open, we’re “airing the dirty laundry,” if you will, and giving them the chance to be refuted in the first place-that complete free expression of ideas, even hateful ones, performs an essential societal function (assuming freedom of the press). While noble, and perhaps a worthwhile value to eventually aspire to, there are a number of problems with the harm principle, explained in anticapitalist theory and even from within liberalism in Karl Popper’s, “The Open Society and Its Enemies.” The first issue is this: there’s an underlying capitalist assumption that a “free market place of ideas,” is something to aspire to in the first place, with an a priori notion that the best ideas would rise to the top and be spread. But we know that capitalism doesn’t allocate resources most efficiently, it allocates them according to what’s best for capital. This can be taken in two ways: literally, that the best ideas would be the ones that perform a capitalist function and sell more magazines, and figuratively, where capital is an analogy for attention, so the “best” ideas are the ones that are most attention-grabbing, hence news outlets’ propensity towards sensationalism. In both of these interpretations, it’s actually pretty clear that freedom of speech can be hijacked by those with interests opposed to the “greater good” of society-as a fascist, all you have to do is align your ideas with capitalism or bury your ideology underneath a sensationalist headline in order to spread your ideology, and who’s going to stop you as they gain popularity? Especially if you’re pretending to offer some absolute truth that can unlock reality somehow and show people what’s really going on? Especially if your ideas teach people to distrust any other method of interpreting the world? Karl Popper’s warning in The Open Society And Its Enemies was that intolerant ideologies will always, in liberal society, use the institutions of liberal society against it to spread. The fascists did this to great effect in Spain, Germany, and Italy in the 1920’s and 1930’s, first complaining that the supposedly “free” press was censoring them, which played on exactly your tendency to utilize the harm principle to ensure free speech rights for all. Playing on these sympathies allowed them to gain a disproportionate platform, as an overcompensation, “hey, let’s give them a chance with the mic, if they’re wrong, we’ll refute them!” The first thing they did was use their platform to silence any dissent, control the narrative, and gain power, then shut down any semblance of a free press as soon as possible. Popper’s solution is to be tolerant of everything except intolerance. A couple more points: waving a swastika or confederate violates the harm principle as it actually does harm to marginalized people who’ve been oppressed, tortured, imprisoned, and terrorized by those ideologies. What’s to say waving a swastika in front of a Holocaust survivor won’t give them a heart attack? If you trigger a PTSD dissociative episode, can you really claim your speech isn’t doing harm to someone else? And finally: censoring someone on reddit isn’t taking away their right to free speech. They’re on an Internet forum with its own set of rules. If someone starts using the n-word when I invite them to an anarchist meetup I’m having at my house, I have every right to kick them out. I don’t have a right to “silence” them by incarcerating them or banning them from applying for a permit to protest in front of the state capitol or anything like that (though the state has a right to deny them a permit because their hate speech could actually do harm to other people-too bad states haven’t been exercising this power more, if they did, antifa wouldn’t have to risk life and limb counterprotesting). And by allowing complete free expression of ideas in any forum, public or private, there’s an implicit message that gets communicated: all ideas being presented are equally valid. By platforming a Nazi, you’re essentially saying that the Nazi’s views are as worthy of being taken seriously as those of a communist, socialist, anarchist, or liberal. By platforming an anti-vaxxer parent, you’re implicitly sending the message that their views are equally as valid as the doctor’s you’re presenting them alongside.

"we are not slaves today This claim gets posted a lot to anarchists. Probably the most concise answer is to ask you what a man is supposed to do for his needs besides work for a capitalist. He can't farm; farmland costs money (this was one of the  capitalists saw to). He can't hunt; hunting is restricted to specific times of the year. He can't even gather effectively since all land is owned privately; a trespassing charge could upset his whole life. Most people in the world have no choice but to participate in capitalism, which of necessity involves choosing a capitalist and making a pledge to do what he orders you to. This is still slavery -- just because it's been refined and abstracted to the point where you're enslaved to a whole class of people instead of to a specific human doesn't make it not so. This is I think the main point of contention for me here, which is that anarchists seem to be unwilling to live the change they want to make in the world. The focus instead seems to be mainly on proselytizing. I suppose you'll just have to find a way to forgive us for choosing the more effective tactic. -what I mean by stability precisely is that we live in a time of the least violence, highest life expectancy, lowest infant mortality rate, lowest levels of poverty, in the history of human existence. There is no point in our past, that would be better to live in then now by nearly every metric safe for maybe the natural world. Most poverty figures are both wrong and phantasmal. Wrong because they reduce human needs to a dollar amount -- as if a homeless man who desperately needs medicine, housing, clothing, etc., and can't get it isn't poor just because he can beg $5.00 a day for food. Phantasmal, because the global capitalist institutions that put out these poverty figures keep lowering the bar for themselves as their economic system fails to meet it. Second, I have to question how much all the rest of it matters if we're failing at something which will destroy the whole society and render it moot. -There seems to be so much hate for anyone who manages to get any sort of expensive thing coming from the doctrine you abide. I'm by no means rich myself, living paycheck to paycheck but when i see someone in a ferrari I'm not jealous of their good thing. It's just a car and maybe it brings them some happiness in this world which is hard to come by. Again, you're confusing hatred of what the object represents for hatred of the object's owner. In the anarchist neighborhood of Exarcheia in Athens, for example, luxury cars parked on the street overnight are routinely vandalized, not because of some personal anger toward the owner but because of what they represent: the touristization and gentrification of the neighborhood, which would displace the poor residents who can't afford to live anywhere else.

I don’t think it’s necessarily about respecting borders because even in a borderless world you will have cultural norms that are different in different parts of the world. Idk the full story with the U.K. and the c word because funnily enough I’ve only heard from men about how it’s really ok and we shouldn’t be offended by it (don’t know if commenter in here is a man or not but past experiences) but if it really is as harmless and “gender neutral” for people in a part of the world I don’t live in I really don’t care. I do care that people/men from the region keep feeling that it’s their place to essentially tell the collective women of the US or wherever else it’s considered really offensive to get over it. That bothers me. To use “guys” as a metaphor. I call my girlfriends “guys” because they’re my friends. I know for a fact they are ok with it as gender neutral.

The doctor does owe us. The pharmaceutical company owes us. Your boss owes us. Jeff Bezos owes us. Everything is for everyone, because nothing would have existed without the collective efforts of all. Again, fuck the NAP.

"Santa’s operation, in other words, amounts to an egalitarian, internationalist, luxury-commodity distribution apparatus that blatantly disregards the mores of the free market, and is based neither in the pursuit of profit nor in the hierarchy of charity, nor grounded in the nation state. [...] But yes, I hear you, there is also much to be said against Santa Claus. In particular, the idea that his distribution apparatus is egalitarian clashes harshly with reality: whatever the myth promises, the rich kids will not only receive better, fancier, and shinier gifts, but they’ll also be ensured the essential social goods that poorer children are denied even in our rich nation: quality nutrition, secure housing, good healthcare, clean water. This really sums up the problems I have with the santa claus story. It's supposed to be egalitarian, but it isn't. not at all. But is that the fault of Santa Claus? Or is it the fault of capitalism? It's obviously the fault of capitalism, but what do you gain from lying to your children about it. Teach your children that capitalism is fucked up. Not that there's some magic in the world that makes everything okay when they're going to find out it was all a load of bullshit. we can fake it once a year by lying to our kids. Is this satire?

"Social democracy is dead and has been dead for years. It died back with when the state could dictate and manage its own contained economy. The evolution of the state has no control of the economy, it is in an impossible foreign debt situation, and can take away anything a social-democracy ever established to maintain social order. The evolution of the state keeps borrowing from the future to keep the wealthy happier and the poor more desperate. It is borrowing from a future that does not exist, from an earth that has been depleted and is dying. Social democracy was a temporary solution to prevent 'state capitalism' from expanding to more countries. Ever since 1990 social democrats from anywhere in the world have been trying to find a new role in politics and can't. They are as obsolete as the welfare state. Today the state plays the role of the reverse welfare state, take it from the masses and the poor and give it to the few and the rich. So, are there more anarchists? No, there are people who realize things are going from bad to worse, people who realize that classic Marxism is an obsolete analytical tool, they don't want to conform to this new social order that is prescribed by neo-liberalism, and the only historical alternative on what to be and what to do is 'anarchism'. As long as there are fools calling themselves anarcho-capitalists, or in the US/UK 'libertarians', an insult to the term 'libertarian' (as was well known in Spain in the early part of the 20th century), and are not isolated and expelled as reactionaries, there can never be anarchists until anarchy is better defined and that definition is widely accepted. But what difference does an individual political identity make? Let's say 51% of youth turn to anarchy. Then? No organization, no agenda, no plan, no program, no tactic, nothing. Just loose ideas, books, brochures, leaflets, slogans, art. Much of it lacking compatibility with one another. Neoliberal capitalism can consume and internalize everything into a commodity and a cult. You say you want a punk movement, I'll sell you punk. You want drugs, I'll sell you drugs. You want riots, I'll sell you rioting equipment. Then you can isolate yourselves away from mainstream society and be totally ineffective. I think Bookchin called it lifestyle anarchy. Go ahead, buy some more. &#x200B; So how can people disengage and step away from capitalism/neoliberalism? Can they? Has it ever happened anywhere? How? Where? Let's ask some native peasants in South Mexico if they know. Can they know better than us? Do they live in capitalism? Are they bothered by policy, socialdemocracy, union negotiations, or anarchy? I don't know, do you? Hey, look, they have a website, enlace.zapatista and they are talking to us. Do we listen? &#x200B; Listen, it is the sound of your world crumbling down Listen, it is the sound of our world surfacing. &#x200B; But we are neither natives, or peasants, or farmers, or indigenous.

Instead of attempting to increase the money you have/receive, decrease what you need money *for*, to achieve the same result. How do you do that? Well, it's overwhelming if you just say 'Rent, food, utilities, gas, phone, clothing, health care, etc', but those are the big things. Leave them aside for now. Get a pencil and a notebook. Carry them wherever you go, from the moment you wake up every morning. Write down every time you interact with the society as it is.

Since history often repeats itself, saying the EU strategy is dangerous (and possibly highly immoral) is an understatement to put it mildly.

"Sure. And, of course, it's a pretty decent answer for 'what do we do with all the land/capital now that's it's just used on an occupancy-and-use basis' given that it could otherwise be hard to portion out, and certain benefits (in economic terms, 'economic rents') accrue to people simply because they're the ones currently using a plot of land or means of production, while at the same time use of land and MoP causes either to decay (in economic terms, 'depreciate') over time (which is a problem of incentives, if you can't sell it off afterwards - no real reason to not just run it into the ground and leave it ruined for the next gal) if not maintained. If you set up an institution or institutions to manage the land and MoP, renting it out to people to use for their own purposes, that solves these problems. The institution(s) could maintain these things, and would have a clear incentive to do so, given that they would presumably get some of the money from the rents. They could also portion out the land and MoP to whoever needed it most and/or would make the most productive use of it - because they would presumably pay the most, and would thus give the institution(s) the most money. Further, making the land and the MoP be rented would make the natural form of any business be a worker co-op. Firms currently take their capitalist, autocratic form because there is always the question of 'ownership'. *Someone* had to lay out the starting money to buy a firms land and MoP. Even in co-ops, there is sometimes the question of buying in, of earning your place by buying a share or earning one with sufficient labor - and, when being fired by vote, there is often the question of buying someone out, of making sure that your shares do not end up in someone's investment portfolio. A system of rented-out MoP and land solves all this - none of the firm's members needed to lay out initial investment to create it, and they have no claim to ownership. Further, it leaves open the possibility of firms easily splitting when they grow too large for workplace democracy to be quick and pleasurable - no one has to buy anyone out, and there is no question of debts. And, of course, we would set up the institution(s) to distribute the profits equally to all of us - both for moral reasons (who owns the land?) and for practical ones (because we can and we want to) - either way, providing both a UBI and a system for partitioning out the resources we need to use to labor.

"Of course not. A materialist analysis of the state would involve its dependence on the material process of production, the economic foundation of society. Is that not what you mean by 'materialist analysis'? If it is, then you'd have to recognize that the abolition of the state cannot be effected until the changes in the economic foundation of society have occurred to render the state a superfluous institution. These changes themselves, i.e. the abolition of capitalist relations of production, can only be the centralization of production under a common plan (and therewith a centralized institution) to eliminate the economic foundation of the value-form of products of labor, the fundamental prerequisite for capitalist production. Such institution can only be controlled by that class which has as its interests the abolition of capitalist production, the proletariat. Against a stronger and more experienced class, the bourgeoisie, this institution must also be a state, insofar as it an organ for domination with a monopoly on violence. This is the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is the fundamental condition of communism. All this is elucidated exclusively by a materialist analysis. Any position which comes to reject the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat must, in its analysis, belong to an analysis which has idealist notions as its presuppositions. Moreover, you conceptualize the dictatorship of the proletariat, particularly during the Paris Commune but I'd imagine anywhere it has happened, as a 'Marxist idea,' which if that is the case, then you yourself are engaging in an 'idealist analysis' by categorizing class action as determined by an idea, plan, blueprint, etc. and not out of the necessity of a class and its interests. I mean, while we're on the topic, there are other flaws in your post. >Yes, anarchism comes from a liberal European tradition. That doesn't mean it is aligned with liberalism today. It diverged significantly after 1848 when proletariat revolutionaries realized the liberal bourgeoisie would always be down to use them for a fight and then sell them out after. Anarchism, in its *modern* incartation, comes from the French Revolution, not the 1848 revolutions. The discovery you ascribe to these revolutionaries in 1848 had already passed, primarily in the French Revolution. But you are right to say that anarchism derives from liberalism. It is in fact prevalent among the peasantry and petty-bourgeoisie, evidenced in the experience of the First International and Bakunin's success in Italy, Spain, and Russia (IIRC) -- the relatively backwards nations, in terms of capitalist development. Anarchism's tenets of autonomy, self-determination, individualism, and federalism reflected the reaction of the poor peasants and petty-bourgeoisie who suffered daily from capitalist expansion and the threat of sinking into the proletariat. But in that sense, it's reactionary in program, since it seeks to adopt pre-capitalist or at least early-capitalist levels of production, anything that opposes monopoly -- when in fact the dictatorship of the proletariat must have an economic monopoly. It's the contradiction between individual labor indirectly being social labor and thus having to be mediated through commodity exchange. Keeping individual labor in this state would continue capitalist relations of production or, more generously, continue embryonic capitalist relations. >In 1871 you see the final break between the anarchist and communist traditions with classical liberalism, There is no 'final break' here, not in the sense of anarchists from liberals nor in the sense of anarchists and communists from liberals. The anarchists were detached from liberals much earlier, and the communists (assuming you meant Marxist communists) never broke from liberals since they were never a continuation of their principles. What you *do* see (not in 1871 but in 1872) is the final break between anarchism and communism in the Hague Congress. >when the working class of Paris expelled the liberal business class and ran the city as a dictatorship of the proletariat (which is a Marxist idea but in this case also certainly anarchist. That split came later). In what way do you figure the Paris Commune to be anarchistic? It certainly can't be because there were anarchists involved, just as the French Revolution wasn't proletarian because proletarians were involved. >Liberals believe free speech is some kind of 'right' that is enshrined in a constitutional document, that applies equally to all people because the state (supposedly) enforces it. No, liberals believe a right to be afforded by virtue of being human, cf. the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen in 1789. It is not because the state enforces these rights that they are rights, to liberals, but because they are 'natural to man.' >Anarchists, being materialists and realists, know free speech is the condition of being able to speak and to have your voice matter, regardless of what your so-called 'liberal rights' actually are. How does this diverge from the liberal conception? >So an anarchist analysis of speech in American society would reveal this: due to the overwhelming control of most people's lives by the dictatorship of the workplace, the privatization or government control of all land, and the destruction of communities and local autonomy, most people have almost ability to speak and be heard. They have the 'right' to free speech, but this means nothing since materially, they are unable to do anything with it. Okay, but what distinguishes this from, say, in the Black Civil Rights movement where organizers joined together to ensure the right of Black people to vote? Did they have to employ an anarchist analysis to 'reveal this'? >It's not that anarchists even have to disagree with the idea that this 'right' exists somewhere out in the aether-- it's just that they don't really care, since they are interested in actual human liberation and not symbolism. If anarchism is supposedly materialistic, as you say, then this cannot be the case. You tiptoe between idealism and materialism. >This materialist analysis is what differentiates anarchist theory from liberalism. Again, not materialist nor is it distinguishable -- as you have presented it -- from liberalism. ",t3_aafwou,Anarchism

Like the OP, and many of you, have a good job in the IT industry, for a hedge fund, and that has almost driven mad for the last year. I have been squeezed till the last drop there. Long hours, pressure, rude comments... all cause I thought I couldn’t do better (not living in the country I was born nor English being my native language) until recently was hospitalised cause the doctors my heart was about to give up. Partly for partying and drugs, as a way of escapism, partly due to stress and anxiety at work caused it. I got to a point that stopped playing video games or reading novels cause I was also under the impression doing that was a privilege and also was fuelling even more this society. Seeing some of you also game here has opened my eyes and made me realise I wasn’t doing anything wrong. Also used to talk about politics to colleagues and other people around me in the office but that too burnt me out. Fortunately, I have been lucky and tomorrow is my last day at that company. Found something that on paper seems better and more relaxed, hopefully it triggers more changes to go back to my (not so)old self being both mentally and physically healthy.

"Krav Maga is a great system and one that when done well, can be very deadly (personally I like styles that pull and learn from others more than the traditional, more rigid styles). &#x200B; The reason I hear why a lot of leftists don't like it is the politics behind it. Which is understandable, I guess, but in my experience, a lot of martial arts has unsavory politics. A lot of gyms have cops in them or will do trainings/seminars just for cops. Ultimately, for me, I'm willing to bite my tongue in this kind of situation and learn a skill that will save my life, than be on a high horse. &#x200B; Really, there is no such thing as a perfect martial art for every situation. Every style has benefits and draw backs that you need to consider. I'd be wary of any teacher who says that their chosen style is the best. We need to recognize our limits and know how to surpass them. I'm great at a stand-up fight, but I am weak at grappling and will lose that fight. &#x200B; When it comes to picking a style, you should examine a couple different things. These are just my main considerations. I'm sure other people have other things to add. 1. What are you hoping to accomplish by learning this style? 2. What can you afford to do? 3. How much time can you devote to studying martial arts? 4. What can your body handle doing. If you're hoping for some basic self defense against a random person, then you have a lot of options available. If you think you're going to be in a situation against another practitioner, then you need to be a little more selective. I think Krav Maga, FMA, BJJ are all good choices. Personally, when I chose to study FMA, I was thinking about how most fascists and homophobes are cowards and are probably going to want to use a weapon for the power trip, I chose a style that specifically dealt with weapons. Unfortunately, we still live in a capitalist system and we're most likely going to have to pay to attend a gym to study a martial art. Like my gym is $120 a month (4 classes a week), which is comparable to others in the area. Some systems also require you to buy lots of tools and uniforms and other things which add to the cost. I've probably put in >$100 for all my equipment. To get really good at a system, you're going to have to practice outside of class too. I usually add in 10-30 minutes a day practicing forms and styles a day depending on what my schedule is. You're going to be limited by your body in what you can do. Between a horseback riding injury, playing HS football, and being overweight most of my life, my knees are absolutely shot. I can still generate a lot of power with my kicks, but I would not be able to devote myself to studying a style that made use of a lot of kicks. &#x200B; Ultimately, choose the style that works best for your life. And make sure you're having fun. That should be the goal every class IMO. ",t3_a5xd3r,Anarchism

"UBI is the final bandaid of the giant, pus filled, infected wound that is capitalism. The reason it seems like a good idea is because it appears fair but in reality it's not shifting the means of production or improving rights/democracy. It's merely welfare for everyone and it might have some short term benefits. Picture a future under such a thing. Automation will be the new outsourcing as jobs 'come back' in a new Amazon type model where people work maybe 20 hours a week or less on average. Sounds good, but now labour has been decimated because why would anyone give a shit when they have their basic needs met? Benefits, full time, and bargaining rights will be a thing of the past as unions are shrunk and privatization replaces more public staples. No one will notice this difference and perhaps frustration with the overburdened public systems will actually make them want this environment because private industry 'cares' about their customers. To make your life easier and because you have no autonomy with consistent attempts to maximize profit, much of what you do have will be pay as you go. You won't own a whole lot of tangible assets, just monthly subscriptions and generic living items. Again, who gives a shit? You're gonna have the Playstation 20 with the sickest graphics and sexy realistic anime women to virtually bone whenever you want. Sure, there's gonna be industry around niche things and maybe you can start up a hippie crystal e-shop for some side cash but you're still under the boot of big business who will control every aspect of your life still. Politically, our future generations and perhaps even ours will be far more 'apolitical' as UBI gives us a choice of whether we want to go with the gutted public system or 'Bob's Robo Health Clinic' which has some program tell you that your headache will pass and pop out a prescription before it sends you on the way. With working less and having extra money in the pocket, you'll have lots of great free time to just keep buying things that make you feel good. I expect there will be a lot of study done in this field and the features of alienation will have some freaky results such as the above example of 'Playstation 20 Anime Sex 2052'. With UBI, the state is constantly playing economic catch up to ensure that people meet their basic needs but also, and more importantly, they will make sure that it is economically viable to continue healthy profit margins. Ironic that capitalists who wish to continue this dreadful system will have to turn to the government they supposedly hate in order to survive... The big turning factor for all this will be what crisis will totally topple this shit for good? Climate change is on track to basically fuck up the global south permanently and that has massive political implications which may lead to instability and deepened divides in countries which bear the most of it's burden. Post-Capitalist scenarios following UBI will probably be difficult to tackle. Future gens may come to terms with the situation and focus on fixing the mistakes of the past but the damage will be great to both our psyche and the planet. Let's just hope geoengineering and aggressive imperialist countries doesn't lead to the apocalypse! In any case, capitalists by this point may have quite literally ditched the planet for fucking Mars or something and then IMO we are just going to have to nuke a 100 year old fused Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos cyborg once and for all. So if there's anything I can tell you from this long story it's that you're either going to see positive social change that tells this shit future to fuck off or you're gonna maybe live long enough to be one of the many millions who will die fighting the Jefflon Buskzos cyborg which has garrisoned itself on Mars with an army of Alexa bots.

"Actually-existing schools are about as far as you can get from the anarchist ideal of education short of literally shackling students to their desks. Large groups of people with surging hormones and still-developing brains are forced to associate with one another on pain of imprisonment for truancy. Social hierarchies are imposed upon the student body from above. Those at the bottom of said hierarchies are constantly harrassed and abused by those above them, yet legally prohibited from doing anything to avoid that torment (because again, truancy). Human beings are supposedly social animals. To force them into an artificial microsociety where every interaction results in pain and torment and *not* expect them to reciprocate in kind is irrational. The gun itself is a force-multiplier, some form of which is required if a person low in the hierarchy seeks to be an equal. Liberalism requires that those at the bottom of the hierarchy accept that position, thus it seeks to remove that force-multiplier. The anarchistic objective should be to eliminate the hierarchy itself. Since shooting up schools is an extremely sub-optimal solution to that problem, the goal ought to be providing a more appropriate force-multiplier, rather than just removing the one that already exists, especially since there are other problems for which guns *are* an appropriate force-multiplier.",t3_a942vr,Anarchism

"G.O. said many good things through his stories (animal farm, 1984), and there are tons of good books by libertarians and anarchists, but they don't constitute a single social, economic, political theory as Marxism did. Now Marxism as an analysis of capital, class structure, was great. This is how actually capitalism worked. Marxism remained static, while capitalism evolved to be bullet proof, or at least be able to resist pressure from traditional popular movements, essentially syndicalism. In the 1880s capitalists were terrified of unions. In the 30s they figured they had to do something or it would only be a matter of time before they were eaten up by organized labor. Neoliberalism was a set of ideas in the 30s on what capitalists should do so they are no longer threatened. In the 40s in Breton Woods the very first step was taken. Then the Nixon shock came to cash in the goods of that reform. The power of the state to regulate the state economy was passed to private banking. Then there was the Chilean experiment, then Argentina and Brasil. Capitalists around the earth figured they either join in 'the organization' or lose what they had through their managed state national economies. So capital shifted from state banks to private international banks to shift around and defend capital as a whole. The organization was international banking and financial institutions. They gathered enough capital to control all and every state financially. They bought their debt and forced them to convert 'public' property into 'state property'. Then state property, as property, became a commodity. Then the states would pay off debt with what used to be 'public'. Like armed gangsters that took the world's population by surprise. Unions would appeal to factories for wages and conditions. Factories would pretend they were nearly bankrupt. (Look at auto-manufacturers having little profit from cars and shifting profit to financing and insurance as separate enterprises). Then unions would appeal to states who were powerless to affect either the factories or their own budgets, being kept prisoners of international banking and debt management. Production would shift from place to place and profit could be isolated in separate enterprises. Syndicalism lost its role. It doesn't matter who ever gets elected, the economy can not be affected by state policy, and if the state wants to avoid bankruptcy it better do just what international bankers tell it to do. Marxism is no longer able to explain reality, and Marxists would rather deny reality than admit their static old theory as obsolete. Poor Marx couldn't possibly see the future as it evolved and the future was shaped to defeat Marxism. The EZLN talked about neoliberalism as something specific in 1/1/1994 , the world turned its head and listened. 25 years later both marxists and anarchists refuse to talk about neoliberalism as if it doesn't exist. A state economy, and state contained capital shaping the state, no longer exist. Aaahhh we need new theory? What for? To base a political organization and develop expertise and hierarchy on theory? Wrong again. The 'temples of ideology' will always be hierarchical institutions who develop their own self-interest in preserving 'the temple'. The political organization and society will always have a hierarchical relationship. This is like being in the start of a new loop. We may be ready to make the second same mistake. We must learn from those that succeeded instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. We pretend nobody has yet been able to escape. But they have, for 25 years escaped the madness, they don't live in capitalism, they are not affected by state politics. How long can we pretend they are irrelevant? Just because they are indigenous peasants and we are not? Just because they can eat their own food and we can't? Look what we use to communicate with one another, look at what they use to talk to each other, how they decide their future when we have our future decided for us by others. &#x200B;",t3_a1qjjn,Anarchism

"Communists (And I'm not splitting hairs on this word) have historically wiped out anarchists and any other branch of socialism that doesn't agree with them. We already landed in the fool me twice. Russian revolution and the Spanish Civil War. &#x200B; The problem in insurrections is that even while some movements can be a majority working class in membership, people with higher education tend to take the vanguard of the movement. That doesn't just go for communists either. Writers of anarchists theory we tend to quote all the time were not working class folks. Peter Kropotkin was an aristocrat. So was Mikhail Bakunin. Buenaventura Durruti was not, but that's an exception. &#x200B; When you have middle/upper class leaders in a movement and they form into a vanguard party, that becomes a problem when they seize state power. It's the complete opposite of socialism. In reality the working class didn't seize power, they just switched out one group of rich fucks for another. This is what happened in all of the successful communist revolutions. &#x200B; That being said I do completely agree with you on the new wave of anarchists focusing more on identity politics. Unfortunately we've focused a lot more on competing to be the most oppressed rather than connecting the dots to class oppression that effects us all. Take for instance the poverty level of transgender people has hardly ever been brought up. We are not linking the different facets of oppression back to the overall big picture of class war. Also we are not differing the oppression of the working class people of a discriminated segment of the population from the upper class of the same segment. Take for instance Caitlyn Jenner , who was widely praised for coming out trans, does not equate to a trans on the street turning tricks to survive. &#x200B; I think it's easier for people to identify with oppression of their identity over class oppression because let's face it, a lot of anarchists in the first world did not grow up poor.

"In my current opinion Capitalism, which I used blame everything on, is not exactly the real problem. The problem is human beings and what our incentives are. Capitalism is simply a ledger, a social contract that allows us to be highly specialized and exchange our goods and services. It's people that are the problem and until we solve the problem with our incentives, it doesn't matter what system we try to create because greed and hunger for power will resurface. I've already tried to address the misconception that capitalism is nothing more than markets and money elsewhere, so let me just say that if the greed and venality of humans is your worry, the *last* thing you should ever want is an economic system that rewards greed with power. This is why I'm interested in people doing and showing rather than telling. Why not try to create a microcosm of the society that you want to live in somewhere in the world right now in your life time? Start by slowly removing yourself from the capitalist world one day at a time. Stop using money wherever possible by building a community of people with all the skills and resources you need and openly trade each others goods and services. If it's truly a better system it will helplessly catch on and expand. I simply do not believe that the CIA would be interested in this type of 'hippy,' for lack of a better word, experiment unless you continued to attract negative attention by dawning masks and lighting the city on fire. We as consumers hold all the cards, we prop up the powerful, so if you want to inspire us to change our incentives away from material wealth and status, you need to use whats proven to work. Marketing! I just don't see the riot side of anarchism, ever being able to inspire civilization. With no intent to offend, this is terrible advice. What you're describing already exists; it's called a commune. You're dead right that the CIA would never interfere with it, because it's not even necessary to do so. No capitalist media will cover your commune, and by withdrawing from capitalist society, you give up the ability to be in regular contact with, and thereby educate and organize, the rest of the working-class. There is a reason Harriet Tubman is a symbol of effective struggle against a corrupt institution instead of the slaves she helped run away to Canada: she stayed and grappled with the problem by breaking the law and even picking up a gun to fight it. Can I own and run one coffee shop? How about two? What if people really like my coffee shop and its lined up out the door everyday? Can I build a few more to give people more access to what I'm creating that they seem to love. I don't know, can you? Can you run even a single coffee shop by yourself, or will you require other laborers? If you need other people, then they deserve a say in the business too. Now, that said, there's no particular reason why your coffee *co-op* can't bring on more members and expand to more locations while voting on the standards for the particular recipe and style that your customers know and expect. It all just seems so complicated the to me destroying the fragile stability we've established so far in this blink of human history, is the wrong move. What stability? We're ten years away from global climate collapse unless we drop what we're doing right now. Humans lived under primitive hunter-gatherer communism for millions of years, under agrarian city-states for tens of thousands, under feudalism for a thousand, and under capitalism for a few centuries, and now we're a decade away from absolutely fucking it. This is, by far, the *least* stable system we've ever tried. It looks stable because you were born into it. That's all. Of course they have all the trappings of a western life but that's what they were born into. Those are the incentives they've been born into. You know how rare it is for someone to be born into a structure and then form an objective view about that structure and have opinions that may go against it? You have to be a moral hero. So, in my opinion, to just automatically write people off as your enemies when from their perspective they did everything society said a good successful citizen is supposed to do, is a mistake. Do you see that side of it? Sure. People who stand to lose from a change, or think they stand to lose, will always be the enemy of that change. But the numbers aren't on the side of the wealthy and well-to-do, do you see? What if, for every 100 people infuriated by the burning of a Beemer, 200 downtrodden and poor workers who could never, ever afford that car are encouraged by the anarchists getting away with destroying it and bearding the cops in the heart of their city, such that they wonder if they might be able to start a protest for their own issues?

"**Muʿtazila** Muʿtazila (Arabic: المعتزلة‎ al-muʿtazilah) is a rationalist school of Islamic theology that flourished in the cities of Basra and Baghdad, both now in Iraq, during the 8th to the 10th centuries.The adherents of the Muʿtazili school, known as Muʿtazilites, are best known for denying the status of the Qur'an as uncreated and co-eternal with God, asserting that if the Quran is the word of God, He logically 'must have preceded his own speech'.The philosophical speculation of the Muʿtazilites centred on the concepts of divine justice and divine unity. The school worked to resolve the theological 'problem of evil': how to reconcile the justice of an all-powerful God with the reality of evil in the world. It believed that since God is just and wise, He cannot command what is contrary to reason or act with disregard for the welfare of His creatures.Muʿtazilites believed that good and evil were not determined by revealed scripture or interpretation of scripture, but they were rational categories that could be 'established through unaided reason'; because knowledge was derived from reason, reason was the 'final arbiter' in distinguishing right from wrong.The Muʿtazili school of Kalam considered the injunctions of God to be accessible to rational thought and inquiry and that reason, not 'sacred precedent', is the effective means to determine what is just and religiously obligatory.The movement emerged during the Umayyad Caliphate and reached its height during the Abbasid Caliphate. After the 10th century, the movement declined. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a494px,Anarchism

"Communal ownership is not the same as state ownership. This is because it is based on horizontal relationships between the actual workers and the “owners” of social capital (i.e. the federated communities as a whole, which includes the workers themselves we must stress), not vertical ones as in nationalisation (which are between state bureaucracies and its “citizens”). Also, such communal ownership is based upon letting workers manage their own work and workplaces. This means that it is based upon, and does not replace, workers’ self-management. In addition, all the members of an anarchist community fall into one of three categories: 1. producers (i.e. members of a collective or self-employed artisans); 2. those unable to work (i.e. the old, sick and so on, who were producers); or 3. the young (i.e. those who will be producers). Therefore, workers’ self-management within a framework of communal ownership is entirely compatible with libertarian and socialist ideas concerning the possession of the means of producing and distributing goods by the producers themselves. Far from there being any contradiction between libertarianism and socialism, libertarian ideals imply socialist ones, and vice versa. As Bakunin put it in 1867: “We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 127] ",t3_a1z4c5,Anarchism

"Mutualism, i took a look at things with the evidence that i had and i went with mutualism because that's how i thought a society would work best. But i kind of have my own version of mutualism or something like that. In my version, the workers work in cooperatives, and the co-operative as a whole decides (democratically with all the workers deciding what to do managing the company as a direct democracy) what to sell, who to sell it to, and the total profit, is given equally to all the workers that participated on the production of the goods they sold, although, if you worked more hours or produced more than other workers, then the whole value of those products that you produced and that the cooperative sold should be given to you, because you worked more than the average or the minimum time that the workers should/must work. Another thing that i thought was that the workers should organise in the factory some sort of treasury, so the factory can buy more equipment and grow as a whole, but this would be the decision of the workers, so they can have backup in case the factory starts having a rough time. In the domestic issues, im kind of divided, because, i am okay with direct democracy, but of there is a direct democracy then the people that disagree with a policy and don't have enough members to change it means that this people would be trapped or discriminated by the same system that we promised that wouldn't discriminate them, so sometimes i just prefer total anarchy, with no sort of policies, but this could turn into chaos, so yeah im pretty divided.

" 'All I charged was enough to break even. ' Translation, you charged enough to make the payments that give you more equity into a home while your tenants got nothing. Not only that but your tenants alleviated you from a bill. You still exploited them. 'Then you know what happened? Both sets of my renter's trashed the place, and left me holding the bill, while constantly having me come over to put a single screw in a light fixture, and shit like that. All while I was trying to figure out how to be a dad, and trying to figure out when I was ever going to sleep again. So yeah, I was a little stressed.' Something in your story doesn't add up. They trashed the place but still called you often to see how they trashed it? But just pretending for a second it does add up and that actually happened, I call my landlord for every little repair I need to. Why? Because after I got the house that was 'thoroughly cleaned' after the last tenants I found a bunch of mold and shit in my dishwasher (along with other places). So I tried to be self sufficient and clean the dishwasher thoroughly. However there was mold deep in the jets at the bottom so I finally called maintenance and told them to come over. They then said that I could get charged for the dishwasher because I took it apart (even though it still worked). So god damn fucking right I call my landlord for everything now. 99% of the time your city has a code requiring 'every screw' to be in a fixture. What happens if they get out there own drill and break it? Oh then they're awful people who trash the place... You can pretend like you're this awesome and amazing landlord that's better than the rest of them but in reality you share in common the same bourgeois idealism, that with careful selection you will rent to great tenants who will hold the same ideals that you do and live in the house the same way ***you think you do,*** (you would probably be a much more difficult tenant than you think you would) and turn land-lording into a simple passive income where nothing goes wrong... It's why every landlord regardless of how many tenants you have shares the same shitty classist view, because they're the victims in their head.

"**Project Cybersyn** Project Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971–1973 during the presidency of Salvador Allende aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.Project Cybersyn was based on viable system model theory and a neural network approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (Cybernet) in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in 'almost' real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (CHECO, for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_aatgzg,Anarchism

Besides, literally no primitivists I’ve ever met (and *categorically* not the anarcho ones) want to dismantle hospitals or destroy medicine. They want you to listen to the facts your vaunted sciences have been discovering for decades: that pre-agricultural people were unequivocally healthier and that traditional botanical/fungal pharmacopeias were every bit as effective as modern medicine *and not made scarce by the brutality of the market.* A pretty large portion of modern industrial pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on exploiting plants and fungi in the first place anyways. I’m not just talking discovery, but actual production: fungal enzymes do all the most complicated chemical work.

Not just in demonstrations and with willing participants, but against another person who's actively trying to win. The reason for that is, and this is personal experience, you fucking forget everything when you get clocked in your first real fight. You need experience to be able to do things regularly. In that sense Krav Maga is kind of overrated. Yes, it's good. Yes, it covers a lot of situations. But a lot of Krav Maga gyms don't spar regularly so they don't produce experienced fighters. If you can find a gym that spars regularly go for it. It helps. If they don't spar though, then it's useless. It's just cardio.

In the first place, “libertarian” was coined by French anarchists, and referred to socialists that were against the authoritarian socialism of people like Blanqui as much as they were opposed to capitalism. However in the 1960’s, right wing “free market” Americans started to co-opt the descriptor in an attempt to distant themselves from what they perceived as the current status quo in capitalist politics. Anyways, this distinction caught on, at least in America and parts of Europe, and now people associate libertarianism with exploitative capitalists (as you seem to be doing) instead of with left-wing anti-authoritarian revolutionaries.

Authoritarianism would be, say, the police (or any state apparatus) rolling out and arresting you for cultural appropriation because the Higher Echelons of society have spoken. A quick Google search didn't turn up any instances of the cops cracking skulls for a white girl wearing a bindi - so I think we're good on that. Private companies sometimes hear criticisms from these groups and change due to pressures - and that's their prerogative. Remember that, at the end of the day, businesses really just want one thing and that's to make money. So you see 'Happy Holidays!' or 'Let's just not play 'Baby it's cold outside'' or 'Let's try to capitalize on the wider market by making our video games more approachable to women and minority groups' and honestly this stuff is just trivial pandering in light of all the other terrible stuff they never make concessions for. Really, it's not about conforming to minorities demands - it's about hearing out and attempting to grasp where someone who has grievances is coming from. It's about dealing with the messiness of human misunderstanding and giving respect to people.",t3_a62wsz,Anarchism

"For me I would agree that there is a lot of theory, but what attracts me to anarchism is that it will never be a step by step model to get to a certain place. Because you're putting the decision making power into the hands of workers and normal people, the outcomes will vary in many different places. There are of course several common themes; avoiding central authorities, perhaps abolishing police, etc. But this is also it's greatest weakness. Because it lacks the one size fits all model, it's prone to attacks from outside and in. ",t3_aaov7h,Anarchism
"I'm not French, and I've only been anarchist (openly) for a few years but I'll take a crack at it. This is just my personal opinion. Let's throw a few completely improvised percentages out there. Let's say about 1 in 10 French citizens are revolting in some way, on the streets or from home, ideologically or actively. Now let's say, of those 10%, about 1%-5% ever actually reach media attention. Let's also assume that 1%-5% are not actually the most radical elements of the public demonstrations. All this taken into account, why would 'The French' have anti-revolutionary sentiments? I can think of two obvious reasons that must surely encompass the vast majority of those holding this stance: * Guilt For all their violence and outrage, the French cannot escape the guilt tripping of the state/corporate chimera. They believe, for reasons much more complicated than some random redditor can explain, that if they make 'reasonable' demands and level a 'reasonable' proportion of outrage, the state/corporate chimera will acknowledge them as anything more than a mild annoyance. * Fear When guilt doesn't work, leaders will inevitably fall back on fear. So they don't feel guilty? So they're still angry you're making empty promises? Riot police and incredible violence should dissuade them, and this is baked into almost every modern revolutionary ideology. They have limits; they will give up if enough force is applied. The state knows this - it controls energy, food, the media - *history itself* All revolutions will impose limits on themselves before the state does. They will go on the unfortunate defensive, swearing they aren't 'violent extremists' until they eventually negotiate back to square one. ",t3_a54ehd,Anarchism

As for my students, they paid a 'materials fee' for their year of classes and only got materials for half of the year (I mention this in comments above), so they made their contribution and got scammed. As for copying the book, the cost of paper and ink is a lot less than the cost of a licensed textbook, so I doubt the school is taking a loss here in the difference between their scam materials fee and the costs I incurred by printing copies.

"Not every piece of land is well suited to every use. What has happened in the west is that lots of land that would be more productive in other uses has been paved over, built on, etc. Some of the best agricultural land in the world exists in southern California, where it can still be relatively productive even with the available rainfall, but much of that land has been used for housing, while the land that is actually cultivated is not as rich and requires the importation of large amounts of water from other regions. The public rangeland that ranchers have access to are mostly lands that require considerably greater acreage per head of cattle than is anything like efficient, while cattle grazing has effects on the land that create costs for those downstream, while effectively also reducing 'mixed use' land to inefficient cattle-grazing land and not much else. The ecological damage caused by the grazing, like the costs associated with bringing in water to irrigate land that cannot be productive otherwise, are not costs that can be borne by the ranchers or farmers themselves—at least without immediately making their ventures unprofitable. The ranchers do not pay for the upkeep of the land, while their use of the land makes the 'multiple use' mandates—the thing that makes the land useful as a commons, whether it is a question of historical significance, general ecological significance, specific land- and water-management uses, wildlife management, etc.—essentially meaningless. The ranchers have no interest in a 'commons' where they would have to concern themselves with the other uses of the land. They want private property at the cost of others. As for the Bundy family's ideas, they're not odd at all. They are quite simply the ideas of a very familiar kind of capitalism, mixed with the ideas of a very familiar kind of theocratic dominionism. You may think that capitalists and theocrats are 'harmless people,' but that's going to be a hard position to back up with any sort of anarchistic argument. What they are trying to do is appropriate land that has been set aside for non-commercial uses, in large part because it would not *pay* under normal commercial use and thus has only functioned for them as an economic resources only when heavily subsidized—and to appropriate it without compensating the other interested parties. The question of 'who is going to patrol' in an anarchist society is probably the wrong question. With nobody to subsidize the use of these particular rangelands, it seems likely that much of the problem would go away. Or perhaps destructive grazing would go on, but without the protection of laws governing private property, and those forced to endure the downstream effects of bad land use would take matters into their own hands. Or perhaps other users of the sort of lands now deemed 'mixed use' would band together in order to protect their interests, whether through some sort of negotiation and exchange or through some more bellicose process. But the bottom line is that in a truly anarchistic society there will be no *a priori* sanction for land use that is fundamentally destructive, so those who engage in it on the sort of scale that we see in the west should expect opposition.

My counter-argument was that while merit and effort should indeed enable a person to reap more rewards, it is overly optimistic to consider any person a master of their fate. People are born to such a wide range of social conditions and societies, that some of them are booked for a handbasket-ride to hell already at birth, while others are well insured against many ways of failure... and the tendency of inequality to spontaneously deepen should be considered beforehand.

I would say leftists, organized or not, need to get in there as advisors, not as bringers of the good word. I would even say that groups like 'La France Insoumise' need to stay the fuck away as an organization. I would say that the best thing communists can do now is to provide technical advice: protest medic training, general protest safety technics, protest tactics, etc. From there they should use the platform to organically defuse certain ideas, and push for people to structure themselves in protest. Then to coordinate themselves across the country, and then, to be able to talk to each other about goals. This should of course include striking workers and unions IMO. Ideally, that could help the movement organize itself enough to make it impossible for groups connected to parliamentary politics to coopt it, and make it very hard for far rightists to take it over, while avoiding easily targetable leaders. The goal of comrades then would be to be in demos, provide skills, histories of struggle, and politicize what is currently a de-politicized proletarian movement.

"'Human rights violations in Pinochet's Chile were the crimes against humanity, persecution of opponents, political repression and state terrorism committed by the Chilean Armed Forces, members of Carabineros de Chile and civil repressive agents members of a secret police, during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile from September 11, 1973, until March 11, 1990. According to the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig Commission) and the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture (Valech Commission), the number of direct victims of human rights violations in Chile accounts for around 30,000 people: 27,255 tortured and 2,279 executed. In addition, some 200,000 people suffered exile and an unknown number went through clandestine centers and illegal detention.[citation needed] The systematic human rights violations that were committed by the military government of Chile, under General Augusto Pinochet, included gruesome acts of physical and sexual abuse, as well as psychological damage. From September 11, 1973 to March 11, 1990, Chilean armed forces, the police and all those aligned with the military junta were involved in institutionalizing fear and terror in Chile The most prevalent forms of state-sponsored torture that Chilean prisoners endured were electric shocks, waterboarding, beatings, and sexual abuse. Another common mechanism of torture employed was 'disappearing' those who were deemed to be potentially subversive because they adhered to leftist political doctrines. The tactic of 'disappearing' the enemies of the Pinochet regime was systematically carried out during the first four years of military rule. The 'disappeared' were held in secret, subjected to torture and were often never seen again. Both the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture (Valech Report) and the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig Report) approximate that there were around 30,000 victims of human rights abuses in Chile, with 27,255 tortured and 2,279 executed.'

You're not going to upend capitalism, obviously, but you can push for laws that can make life a little bit better for some people in the short-to-medium term. I'm not saying that approach is inherently better. But in some situations it works, and one of the reasons I admire anarchism is its diversity of political praxis. You don't have enough money to contribute to a campaign. You're nobody. You're nothing. 'Your' leaders do not give a shit about you Are you American? I'm obviously not talking about mainstream party politics. That crap will get you nowhere. But single-issue pressure groups can definitely enact limited change in legal structures. I know quite a few people in my local animal rights movement and they got some laws passed by a combination of perseverance and irritating/influencing the right people in power. It's not ideal obviously, and you won't see society change overnight, but I'm skeptical of the latter being on the table for any of us to begin with.

I see working with a party on the ground as good praxis if and only if the action taken by the party is ethical in and of itself. I usually sit out during big campaigning runs and recruitment for recruitments sake. One weakness of the anarchist ideology is that we do have a hard time teaming up and gathering mass support. Many other leftist ideologies won't have that same weakness, making it easier for them to get the masses to think in more leftist manners. I think we need to be pragmatic when it comes to working with other leftist movements and parties. We should never compromise core beliefs but we can give som leeway to accomplish better things. I have little praise for systems like social democracy and many other left movements but they are far better than this neoliberal hellhole we have developed.

But, of course, most of that material remains untranslated, so an important part of the 'neo-Proudhonian' activity at the moment is recovering and updating Proudhon's work, doing translations, spreading popularizations of the work through forums like this, etc. You might look, for example, at the ongoing series on ' are available online, along with nearly all of the published writings.

"If you enter into a monogamous relationship, and then you fail to be monogamous, that’s fairly short and belies a pretty deep character flaw. However I wouldn’t say that it necessarily belies an inability to be loyal to an ideology. People aren’t biologically designed to be monogamous, it’s a decision. Biologically, were designed to fill whatever hole we can. Monogamy is a social construct that can, when it works, be a powerful force for good. I do see people who cheat in monogamous relationships to be undisciplined, and perhaps untrustworthy. I don’t think they’re not true comrades though. Devoting yourself to one partner requires you to go against your biology, while devoting yourself to a cause only requires you to go against the barriers of your own society. People who willingly enter into polyamory are of course, not pertinent because that is a willful and conscious decisions that is respectable. ",t3_aa64ec,Anarchism

"From the start, Le Guin was trying to write a 'failed' anarchist society. Like you say, revolution is a constant battle. Annares stopped being 'anarchist' the moment that people stopped working at that. All the rest of the reasons you list, they aren't so much 'not-anarchist' because of the way they're structured, but because at some point people decided, 'This is the best way to handle this thing,' and then left it at that. I don't want to be too hard on the people of Annares, though. A lot of the way their society is structured is, arguably, a reaction to the material circumstances of their environment and their history. That doesn't absolve them of their failure to continue to turn the 'anarchist lens' inward on their own society, of course. But it's a pretty solid reminder of the push-pull of ideal and reality that anarchists have to struggle with in our praxis. Anarchism won't look the same on Annares as it does on a highly developed, post-scarcity world. Anarchism won't look the same in an NYC co-op as it does in Rojava. I think anarcho-syndicalism is pretty accurate; their primary level of social organization seems to be built around specific 'types' of work.",t3_a9nny8,Anarchism

"'Under Bush Sr., the U.S. dropped a whopping 88,500 tons of bombs on Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, many of which resulted in horrific civilian casualties. In February 1991, for example, a U.S. airstrike on an air-raid shelter in the Amiriyah neighborhood of Baghdad killed at least 408 Iraqi civilians. According to Human Rights Watch, the Pentagon knew the Amiriyah facility had been used as a civil-defense shelter during the Iran-Iraq war and yet had attacked without warning. It was, concluded HRW, “a serious violation of the laws of war.” U.S. bombs also destroyed essential Iraqi civilian infrastructure — from electricity-generating and water-treatment facilities to food-processing plants and flour mills. This was no accident. As Barton Gellman of the Washington Post reported in June 1991: “Some targets, especially late in the war, were bombed primarily to create postwar leverage over Iraq, not to influence the course of the conflict itself. Planners now say their intent was to destroy or damage valuable facilities that Baghdad could not repair without foreign assistance…Because of these goals, damage to civilian structures and interests, invariably described by briefers during the war as ‘collateral’ and unintended, was sometimes neither.” Got that? The Bush Sr administration deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure for “leverage” over Saddam Hussein. How is this not terrorism? As a Harvard public health team concluded in June 1991, less than four months after the end of the war, the destruction of Iraqi infrastructure had resulted in acute malnutrition and “epidemic” levels of cholera and typhoid. By January 1992, Beth Osborne Daponte, a demographer with the U.S. Census Bureau, was estimating that Bush’s Gulf War had caused the deaths of 158,000 Iraqis, including 13,000 immediate civilian deaths and 70,000 deaths from the damage done to electricity and sewage treatment plants. Daponte’s numbers contradicted the Bush administration’s and she was threatened by her superiors with dismissal for releasing “false information.” (Sound familiar?)' Bush Sr refused to cooperate with a special counsel. The Iran-Contra affair, in which the United States traded missiles for Americans hostages in Iran, and used the proceeds of those arms sales to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua, did much to undermine the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Yet his vice president’s involvement in that controversial affair has garnered far less attention. “The criminal investigation of Bush was regrettably incomplete,” wrote Special Counsel Lawrence Walsh, a former deputy attorney general in the Eisenhower administration, in his final report on the Iran-Contra affair in August 1993. Why? Because Bush Sr, who was “fully aware of the Iran arms sale,” according to the special counsel, failed to hand over a diary “containing contemporaneous notes relevant to Iran/contra” and refused to be interviewed in the later stages of the investigation. In the final days of his presidency, Bush even issued pardons to six defendants in the Iran-Contra affair, including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger — on the eve of Weinberger’s trial for perjury and obstruction of justice. “The Weinberger pardon,” Walsh pointedly noted, “marked the first time a president ever pardoned someone in whose trial he might have been called as a witness, because the president was knowledgeable of factual events underlying the case.” An angry Walsh accused Bush Sr of “misconduct” and helping to complete “the Iran-contra cover-up”. Sounds like a Trumpian case of obstruction of justice, doesn’t it? Bush Sr escalated the racist war on drugs. In September 1989, in a televised address to the nation from the Oval Office, Bush held up a bag of crack cocaine which he said had been “seized a few days ago in a park across the street from the White House . . . . It could easily have been heroin or PCP.” Yet a Washington Post investigation later that month revealed that federal agents had “lured” the drug dealer to Lafayette Park so they could make an “undercover crack buy in a park better known for its location across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House than for illegal drug activity” (the dealer didn’t know where the White House was and even asked the agents for directions). Bush cynically used this prop — the bag of crack — to call for a $1.5 billion increase in spending on the drug war, declaiming: “We need more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors.” The result? “Millions of Americans were incarcerated, hundreds of billions of dollars wasted, and hundreds of thousands of human beings allowed to die of AIDS – all in the name of a ‘war on drugs’ that did nothing to reduce drug abuse,” pointed out Ethan Nadelmann, founder of the Drug Policy Alliance, in 2014. Bush, he argued, “put ideology and politics above science and health.” Today, even leading Republicans, such as Chris Christie and Rand Paul, agree that the war on drugs, ramped up by Bush during his four years in the White House, has been a dismal and racist failure. Bush Sr groped women. Since the start of the #MeToo movement, in late 2017, at least 8 different women have come forward with claims that the former president groped them; in most cases, while they were posing for photos with him. One of them, Roslyn Corrigan, told Time magazine that Bush touched her inappropriately in 2003, when she was just 16. “I was a child,” she said. The former president was 79. Bush’s spokesman offered this defense of his boss in October 2017: “At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures.” Yet, as Time noted, “Bush was standing upright in 2003 when he met Corrigan.” Facts matter. The 41st president of the United States was not the last Republican moderate or a throwback to an imagined age of conservative decency and civility; he engaged in race baiting, obstruction of justice, and war crimes. He had much more in common with the two Republican presidents who came after him than his current crop of fans would like us to believe.'  ",t3_a22rgf,Anarchism

Cops, as enforcers of class/racial hierarchy, and footsoldiers for the state, also need to be abolished. However, (most, I believe) anarchists don't think crime will magically vanish even after social issues like poverty are taken care of. However, instead of armed stormtroopers for capitalism patrolling our neighborhoods, we would seek a different system. This system, in my view would focus on crime PREVENTION, via community intervention and restorative justice when a crime is committed. This means providing rehabilitation for the offender and closure for the victim. In this case, people are angry that the cops were consulted, but chose to do nothing to prevent the crime. ONE, of the many reasons why cops are awful is this. They rarely prevent crimes like cold blooded murder, but instead wait until the crime is done to address the issue. In the absence of any other system to prevent cases like this from happening, some people are angry that the cops couldn't even do the bare minimum. ",t3_a9xzhc,Anarchism

Malatesta consistently mixed general theoretical insights into what was largely a body of occasional writings. He stands out for the clear presentation of that theory. In that, his writings resemble those of Ricardo Mella, the best works of Emma Goldman, etc. Anarchism has certainly also had more strictly theoretical writings—although even works like Proudhon's tend to be mixed with occasional content—but we've generally neglected that literature in recent years (and perhaps particularly in English-speaking circles.)

"Reminds me of my times in elementary school. I was in kindergarten when 9/11 happened, so probably not even a month after my first day that happened. Every day they would play some patriotic song over the PA system along with the announcements and Pledge of Allegiance (which, seriously, does a kindergarten kid *really know* what they're saying there? It's just another thing to memorize, but this one has big words and mentions God). It kinda sickens me a bit to remember that sort of daily indoctrination (though I do remember them also playing Woody Guthrie's 'This Land was Made for You and Me' which is pretty nice). There was also a class that the younger kids would do called 'Music and Movement' where we'd all sing and dance to various songs, many of them patriotic again (insert 'Proud to be an American' here, and learning it in sign-language to boot. *shudder*). And of course any elementary school music concert was incomplete without patriotic hymns mindlessly sung by the entire class of children. These kids never understand what they're singing about though, maybe before grade 3 or so, if that. They only know that it makes their parents and teachers happy. That's all it really is at that age I think, innocent, mindless, learned repetition. There's no critical thought behind it because they aren't very capable of that yet. But still, it's very Orwellian, and the attempt to implant those ideas are there. The pledge of allegiance does carry on well even through high school here though, along with a weekly singing of the national anthem. And because everyone is doing it, there's peer pressure in you doing it too. It's somewhat resistable when you set your mind to it, but you get a bit ostracized, and the odd teacher will try and make you do it anyway and failing that will send you to the principal, who never can do anything on the grounds of free speech. But yeah, fuck the Public American School System and it's attempts at indoctrination. It's disgusting. ",t3_a9ljk0,Anarchism

I can never find middle ground with them, they want to invalidate my transgender brothers, sisters and betwixt existence, they gleefully spread conspiracy theories about my queer comrades and put ideas in people's heads that make my friends fear going home for the holidays. There is no middle ground- there is no reason to debate them if we are arguing over my right to exist. Their politics says 'mistreat and suppress people, human beings, I dislike for things they can't change.'

"No, I mean that racism (as in institutional racism) was a product of the slave trade that was created TO justify it. The slave trade did not start because of racism, it started out of economic reasons. The slave trade began as a way to exploit an entire group of people of their labor without paying them a dime. The capitalists were all over this. The capitalists didn't look at Africa and think 'these people are darker than me, let's enslave them', they looked at Africa and said 'this is an untapped mine of free labor' with dollar signs in their eyes, then used their race as a justification for it to the working class Europeans and anyone else who may have questioned it, as well as creating things like 'race science' (lies about biological black inferiority that still persist to this day), and many other tactics to promote their view so that nobody saw their real motives here. Racism as we know it today was created this way. You and I are basically discussing semantics here, but you're correct that the distinction is important; and really we're both correct. You're correct in saying that it was a justification, but it was a product of the slave trade so that it could justify it. I'm an anarcho-communist and follow the Marxian view of history ('the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle'), I believe firmly that the slave trade is no exception to this.

"**Libertarian socialism** Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects the conception of socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.Libertarian socialism is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism, and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization.It rejects the state itself, and asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils.All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary human relationships through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life. As such, libertarian socialism seeks to distinguish itself from both Leninism/Bolshevism and social democracy.Past and present political philosophies and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism as well as autonomism, Communalism, participism, guild socialism, revolutionary syndicalism, and libertarian Marxist philosophies such as council communism and Luxemburgism as well as some versions of utopian socialism and individualist anarchism. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_ab18hm,Anarchism

Not really. If that's what you feel you should do, go for it. Anarchists often do not appreciate how valuable first-hand experience of how these mechanisms actually operate is, and that's unfortunate. However, there is something you should keep in mind... You should understand that no matter where you go, you *may be viewed as a legitimate target* (for the reason I outlined in my first paragraph). It doesn't take a genius in anti-colonialist thinking to figure out how said US 'soft power' works, and people in the third-world generally understand that the US (or their proxy regimes) only discern between combatants and non-combatants when it suits them - which is why a lot of anti-colonialist movements don't really bother with the distinction much either.

"I'd say it's a bit more complicated. The university has increasingly adopted corporate models over the past 50 years and transitioned to job training, rather than academic learning. Additionally, faculty are not yet thought of as labor (really, many old guard 60+ faculty still view it as a 'vocation'), PhDs are over exploited and underpaid, and part-time faculty composes most of the instructors. It's easy to become at least left leaning in university, because *you're learning.* But because of this transition, it's actually a huge disadvantage for academics to be 'too left' or at least outwardly activist. Gems like Graeber are rare, and he (knowingly) has the advantage of being an established writer that happens to be cis male and white. It's incredibly difficult for women and PoC to both publish and get and retain higher level academic jobs. And leftists have been fired before tenure. The reception of Marxists/Anarchists/left tendencies can wildly vary between institutions. Not every university administration is as open minded as the New School or Berkeley.

There is a group of people clustered together visible on the left side. They are mostly looking towards the left at something not shown in the photo. Most appear to be young adults and there are multiple arms raised with fists. There is a clearly visible man with very short gray hair who looks somewhat out of place. Most facial expressions look tense, anticipatory, and a bit tired. One man's face has either a large grin or a large grimace. Another man looks like he might be dancing to music. Three women and one man seem aware of the camera and are looking directly at it. Some people have their mouths covered with dark cloth. **Personal thoughts** Something about this image makes me feel weird the longer I look at the various facial expressions.

"There are a lot of things that anarchism would do to the tech landscape that would probably create a brand new context for this problem. Privacy is tied to the concept of identity, in that online technology needs to know certain things about you in order to provide certain things to you, whether it's browser cookies to save your settings or bank information to make an exchange, or a username or e-mail address to direct communications specifically to you. &#x200B; Now the end point of anarchism will do away with government services, and along with them government-issued identity like driver's licenses and social security numbers. It will likely do away with currency as we know it, and therefore banks, so account numbers might no longer be a thing. Those are the primary motivators for identity theft in the present day, and would eventually cease to be a problem. Online platforms would no longer have a financial incentive to collect your information for sale to advertisers, and would likely become more decentralised and community-managed, in which case there would be less information available to hackers or leakers should they be able to break in and expose it. &#x200B; The remaining risks would be impersonation and doxxing, which are actions that disempower a person's ability to function in public. This mostly comes down to personal practice in dissociating your online identities from your identity in real life, although privacy breaches can make identifying you easier. In an anarchistic world this could still be a problem, but because platforms no longer have an interest in correlating your private identity with your public accounts to try to sell you things, it's harder to do. &#x200B; So, as far as I can imagine, the majority of services and institutions that would have incentive to compile sensitive data on you would no longer be relevant in an anarchist world. The reasons for even attempting to expose what information remains would also be reduced. Addressing the remaining risks would really depend on a mix of thoughtful architecture that's resistant to personal data collection. and encouraging good privacy habits among users.",t3_a7mtz3,Anarchism

Similarly, as anarchists, we may be immoral in some moral codes. Certainly Christian ones, which demand you contently follow a hierarchy of family, hierarchy of rulership (so long as it is pious). However as a code of ethics, you may choose for yourself whether hierarchies are unethical, if the church is unethical, if oppression in any guise is unethical. I think that’s the mindset of people who are explicitly anti-morality. Alternatively, they might just be assholes. ",t3_aa7opl,Anarchism

Gerrard Winstanley's followers were known as True Levellers in 1649 and later became known as Diggers, because of their attempts to farm on common land. Their original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the Acts of the Apostles.

"No problem, I'm glad to talk civilly with you. I think your response is missing what I’m trying to show you which is that behind all of the businesses that you hold up as your enemies are people. How is it that you feel that you can decide on someone else’s behalf, say for example a Starbucks barista, that they should feel oppressed of that you know better enough to force them from their current life? How can you do that without seeing the hypocrisy of those actions? I mean, the reality that people are the most important thing in business is invisible to most capitalists, and capitalists do far more damage to people than anarchists and for far less noble reasons, so I don't have a *lot* of sympathy for this point. But realize that it is possible to vandalize a Starbucks just because you don't like Starbucks, or because it's raising rents through gentrification, or because it muscled out your favorite hole-in-the-wall shop. You have a lot of disdain for people who claim to know what's best for Starbucks workers but *you are also* deciding what's best for Starbucks workers by supporting the status quo where Starbucks wields outsized power over communities. If you claim to be interested in freedom, what if you succeed and then with that freedom a large group of people decide to freely organize themselves into a capitalist society? What then? Depends. Do they force people who don't want to live in capitalist wage labor, *including their own children*, to continue to do so? Do they try to buy up land in other communities and expand their capitalism, ignoring how those other communities feel? Do they pump toxins and destroy shared resources which are critical to the health of the global population, like the air and ocean and rainforests? Personally I don’t want to live in anarchy and chaos. That’s not the reality I was born into or desire. I enjoy civilized reality and I also recognize its problems but problems aren’t fixed by destruction they are fixed by good ideas being proven to work by smart people leading by example and inspiring others to follow. Destroying a barrier to that very thing happening is not the same as destroying mindlessly. Some of the most essential things to your modern life came from essentially anarchist and anti-capitalist actions, e.g. Nikola Tesla destroying his own patent rights so that capitalist property relations wouldn't hinder the world from getting electricity faster. Your real enemy, if you're the progress wonk I take you for, is the capitalist who wants to make a profit from controlling access to the accumulated knowledge of humankind. Even the people who hold the power are human beings, not all of them are evil tyrants but none of them will be convinced to change by making them an enemy. Except that the people who hold the power were already making themselves the enemy of the people. We didn't create this situation; we react to it. But where are these prosperous anarchist societies? Where are the examples for us to look at as outsiders and say yes that makes sense let’s do that? They don’t exist because the message we are getting from you is that society needs to change into what you want and then you’ll change too. Why not establish an example of what anarchy looks like somewhere and we can decide for ourselves? Well, the CIA interference might have something to do with it. Capitalists and capitalist governments have a vested interest in 'proving' that anarchism and leftist governing can't work and accordingly, they interfere like crazy whenever the latter spring up. One of the better texts for these sorts of examples is , by Peter Gelderloos. The examples of societies are spread throughout the book, but the table of contents is quite thorough.

The New Declaration of Independence We, the people of these United States, can no longer abide by the rule of law that has become corrupt and tyrannical. Therefore, we reject the ideals and institutions that have become oppressive against not only our own citizens, but to our values as well. As such, we have decided upon a series of articles that accurately reflects our values and will be the basis for our new laws. Article 1: Every human has the right to govern their own body however they choose, mentally or physically. It is the most important property that anyone has, and it is unethical for any institution or governing body to take that away from them. The only exception to be made for this is imprisonment, and only then on the conviction of a violent crime, war crime or a civil rights violation, as they have proven that they do not regard the first right of others. Article 2: Every human has the right of innocence until proven guilty. They shall not have their freedom of movement infringed upon without being convicted of a violent crime. Article 3: Every human has the right to privacy. They shall not be forced, or otherwise coerced to reveal any information that they do not want to reveal. The only exception to this is directly related to the preservation of evidence to be used in a court of law. Article 4: Every human has the right to the basic necessities for an equal start in life. No person shall ever be denied a basic income, defined as the amount of capital needed to ensure that a person will never go unsheltered or unfed. Article 5: Every human has the right to equal and humane rule of law. No person shall ever be subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment, even as punishment. Article 6: Every human has the right to expression. They shall not be barred from using their voice in any manner that they choose, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. Article 7: Every human has the right to education. No human shall ever be denied the ability to learn about the laws that govern them, or be denied the education that they may require to improve their lives. Article 8: Every human has the right to believe in moral authority, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others to do the same. No person shall ever be denied religious freedom or cultural expression, as long as it does not harm others. Article 9: Every human has the right to belong to a community. No person shall ever be removed in any manner from an ethnic, ideological or religious group without their consent, unless they have violated the first article of this Declaration. Article 10: Every human has the right to cast a single vote on any law, or lawmaker, that impacts their life in any way. No person or institution may ever revoke this right. Article 11: Every human has the right to resist. If any law or order is deemed unethical, then any person may refuse to obey it and not suffer consequences for doing so, as long as a jury of their peers has deemed the law that they are accused of resisting is unethical. Article 12: Every human has the right to enough clean water to sustain their own life. Article 13: Every human has the right to travel freely, unless they have violated the first article of this Declaration. Article 14: Every human has the right to healthcare goods or services that are necessary to continue living. Article 15: Every human has the right to live in a clean, and safe environment. No person or institution shall ever knowingly or willingly destroy or otherwise dismantle any environmental protections or safeguards necessary to keep our planet inhabitable. Article 16: Every human has the right to an unbiased government. No lawmaker, representative, or government institution may be forced, bribed or otherwise coerced to favor any law or decree that causes any bias for or against any human, or any unethical treatment of any human. Our legislation is to be purely impartial and democratic. We, the undersigned, believe in these articles so fervently that we will support them until our dying breath. As the Sons and Daughters of Liberty and Justice, we do hereby lend our signature to this Declaration in order to tell all generations, from this day until humanity's last day, that we will no longer stand by while violations of these most basic and true human rights occur. We will live by them and die for them to ensure that all people may live free and eventually take their last breath free. ",t3_a67p5f,Anarchism

">Besides, a small community cannot live long; 'brethren and sisters' forced to meet continuously, amid a scarcity of new impressions, end by detesting each other. And if two persons through becoming rivals or simply not liking each other are able by their disagreement to bring about the dissolution of a community, the prolonged life of such communities would be a strange thing, especially since all communities founded up to now have isolated themselves. It is a foregone conclusion that a close association of 10, 20, or 100 persons cannot last longer than three or four years. It would be even regrettable if it lasted longer, because this would only prove either that all were brought under the influence of a single individual or that all lost their individuality. Well, since it is certain that in three, four or five years part of the members of a community would wish to leave, there ought to exist at least a dozen or more federated communities in order that those who, for one reason or other, wish to leave a community may enter another community, being replaced by new comers from other places. Otherwise, the Communist beehive must necessarily perish or (which nearly always happens) fall into the hands of one individual - generally the most cunning of the 'brethren'.  ",t3_ab303g,Anarchism

If you're brand new and don't have a lot of organising experience then perhaps keep your head down a bit in the sense that you should wait with calling for public meetings that fascists can mess up. However, be confident. They're the minority, we are the majority. Find out information about them. Who are they? How many? Where do they meet? In a campus you often have a friend-of-a-friend who knows some of them. Make fake social media accounts and let them lie dormant for a while and later on start liking their pages (and already right now keep an eye on their social media presence, collect pieces of the puzzle). You can start by ripping down their posters and stickers when you have a few other people with you. Then later on you can call for public events, you can out them on campus, you can put up antifascist and leftist propaganda and you can do more direct action-oriented stuff. A lot of people have been very successful in the situation you are in, because fascists create this huge backlash against them. What's needed is a group to step in and counter them.

Basically he believes in laize fairre economics , reduced social spending, reducing regulations , pursuing policy that is favorable to the rich and big businesses. At the same time he is doing away with a progressive tax policy where the rich pay more in favor of a regressive tax policy where a higher burden falls on the working and middle classes, and the rich pay less in taxes. The protestors want the tax burden to fall more on the rich and big business and to get more social spending directed to them.

"Then you’re at the right place. It just takes a lot of time to understand it completely. If you want freedom then you can’t have an (unjustified) authority figure above you socially. That’s the problem anarchists have with USSR’s state capitalism and capitalists with their representative democracy, police and military. If you want freedom then you cannot have a boss owning your workplace and taking profits from your labour. Which is why anarchists reject capitalism and favour syndicalism and other socialist alternatives. You can’t be free without democracy both at your workplace and in the community you live in. Anarchists believe in direct democracy with people voluntarily taking part in their community. Obviously all these have their limits and their own unique problems. It would take hours for me to explain every one of those. Kibbutz in Israel, Rojava and Zapatista in Mexico are some examples of societies that have elements of anarchism.

"Yeah, oddly enough, I just recently noticed that on his wiki page myself: Miyazaki is critical of capitalism, globalization, and their effects on modern life. He believes that 'a company is common property of the people that work there'. ... Miyazaki felt frustrated growing up in the Shōwa period from 1955–65 because 'nature — the mountains and rivers — was being destroyed in the name of economic progress' ... Suzuki described Miyazaki as a feminist in reference to his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as 'brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart', stating that they may 'need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour' and that 'any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man'. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. ... Michael Toscano of Curator found that Miyazaki 'fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan’s native animism'. The first part is kinda meh, though... I mean, he's not putting his money where his mouth is on that one cos, well, it's not like Ghibli is a Co-op or what have you.

I believed this back when I was a liberal. Yet here we are, almost three years in, and right wingers still dominate Congress. The DNC is still promoting their typical corporatists as possible 2020 candidates, and the GOP are doing the same, though with an added emphasis on xenophobia, transphobia, etc. It's not gonna work. Look at Trumps policies. They're terrible. You're going to risk the lives of innocents for a mere hunch? As anarchists, I think that's something we should be against.

"Ok so I can see you've clearly put a good amount of thought into this, but I'm afraid I object to a) the colorblindness and genderblindness of it. You cannot dismantle systemic oppression and the effects of historical oppression by saying you're being impartial. That is already what the US does, it pretends that racism doesn't exist anymore. b) Article 11: again, that is pretty much how it works already I think. c) you say nothing about capital or wealth, including a redistribution of wealth accumulated by genocide and slavery. d) By not saying anything about wealth, you automatically render useless the statement about the freedom of expression, since as we already see in this society. e) 'crime' has ALWAYS been a racialized category, re: the 13th Amendment. Your Article one has the same exception that the 13th amendment does and will fall prey to the same problems because by this time Blackness has been associated completely with criminality. As the documentary named after the 13th Amendment, '13th' by Ava Duvernay, states. f) what counts as 'violent crime'? And does that mean you are ascribing to the idea that nonviolence is the only legitimate form of activism? Also, are you going to ignore the fact that to this point in history, 'crimes' have been 'criminalized' but wealthy white men tend to never be punished while Black and Brown people are thrown in jail, despite the fact that the history of oppression has rendered them the most vulnerable in society? If you have not already, I encourage you to take a look at the Black Panther Party's 10 point program. g) and this one is pretty important so I'm sorry I forgot to put it here before: your declaration says NOTHING about reparations, within this country or outside it, Or about what it will take to fund/fuel the kind of society you're talking about where everyone has the right to consume equally lol but still consume at the same levels that most Americans have for a long time, on the basis of immense life destruction in other areas of the world.

"Pretty much everybody is there, and most of the country supports it (over 80% approval). It's generally a protest of 'people who aren't happy at the moment'. Macron is a ultra-capitalist, and an ultra-globalist, so yes, nationalists are definitely getting involved, but people against capitalism are also getting involved. I've read all sorts of reasons for people joining the protest. Some people are protesting for lower taxes, some people are protesting for redistribution of wealth, some people are protesting against high homelessness, some are protesting against mass immigration, some are protesting against the EU, some are protesting high unemployment, some are protesting for a lower pension age, some (probably most) want Macron to resign, all sorts of things. I mean, in the picture in the OP there's a guy holding an EU flag. Unless he's about to burn it, that's certainly no nationalist. But the thing that deeply saddens me about this... is that it's the right-wing people who seem to be most enthusiastic about it. There are even reports of right-wing groups putting money into helping people buy yellow jackets, giving them transport, etc. A lot of left-wingers don't seem to have any idea about how to respond to this. We can't attack it, because half of the people there are at least partly on our side, but people seem to think they can't join because they know fascists are involved. I have respect for the communists who are joining the protests honestly. You can't let an opportunity like this pass just because there might be a fascist or two protesting alongside you. It could be decades until we see another protest on such a massive scale. It's much more significant than Occupy Wall Street. Do you realise how terrible it will look in the history books if this becomes known as a 'right-wing protest'? It will make it look like there's a right-wing nationalist revolution in France and Belgium, and that's simply not true. We should be doing all we can to make the most of this. And there are reports that it might soon spread to Germany and the Netherlands. We've all been begging for so long for something like this to happen.

"Let's see, how does one acquire the necessities of life where I live that way? &#x200B; Housing, quite a few cooperatives in my city, someone from my brother's church's youth leader lives in one. Transport: Bicycles are an option and there is a cooperative or commune (I don't know what it is technically classified as because I don't remember them taking any kind of payment) with a bunch of maintenance and rentals of specialty cycles. The public buses and trains aren't technically a cooperative but they are controlled by a non partisan municipal council that isn't too terrible. Ridesharing is also possible with friends, and many people own their own vehicles, so a cooperative ownership system isn't necessary for owning your own vehicle, although the loan for the car can be sourced from credit unions and the seller can be an ordinary person and not some dealership. Mopeds are cheap and still quick in my car addicted city, especially if you can get an electric one, it will be good for many general purpose transportation needs for when you need to go long distance. Fuel: The North Central Cooperative has lots of that, they even refine and transport it themselves to the stations. Groceries: The aforementioned North Central Cooperative has that. Many products are under it's own brand, indicating that it got the product from other cooperatives. This is particularly easier to do if you happen to take a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. Clothing, some basic tools and similar. The Mountain Equipment Cooperative has lots of that, although it's more focused on outdoors quality. It's pricier but lasts much longer and isn't sourced from debt slave labour. There are also some places that sell or trade used clothing as well, and it's very cheap or even free. You can store all your money and get financial things like retirement accounts or loans, including those given to other cooperatives and self operated businesses, from a group called Servus Union. Home hardware and some furniture, power tools, gardening and plants, can all be found from the North Central Cooperative. Your electricity can be sourced from some electric cooperatives where I live, or you can buy the panels outright from them. Being part of a network though is better, and you will feed extra energy into the grid to be used by others. I can't think of any heating gas cooperatives but you can use a lot less heat with some not that expensive housing improvements like double paned glass windows, some decent insulation, and similar. You can also install a heating pump based on geothermal energy. You could feasibly have a whole life based on buying and obtaining almost everything you need and working at either a cooperative or a freelancing individual (be they just some guy who has a used car to sell or a person who has an extra big crop of fruit from the garden). Too bad they aren't nearly as thought of as regular companies who also get a lot of bonus access to many benefits like capital investment from the government. Public transport and utilities though are publicly owned by the municipality and while they aren't really evil, they put way too much trust in business, especially what they believe to be small business.",t3_a30etx,Anarchism

"I watched a video of his on 'George Orwell, Down and Out in Paris London, and Marxism'. I don't know if you are in this sub often or if you know much about anarchism, but Orwell tends to be a big deal around here both for his criticisms of Stalinism and his admiration of the anarchists in Spain. First thing that I noted in his talk is that he'd go off on these rants about 'Marxism', and had a lot of trouble staying on topic because of these rants that didn't really provide anything of substance. Heck, I can come up with better criticisms of real Marxism than he can, he never even once criticised Marx, he just trash talked modern day liberals, who are completely different! Second thing that I noticed was that he tends to be disingenuous. He pulled a quote from one of Orwell's writings talking about something along the lines of the need for revolution rather than reform, and how reform is often just feel good stuff for academic leftists, before delving into another rant about the US's Democratic Party. The thing he didn't mention is that Orwell is attacking reformism from the left! Anarchists, Communists, and and other types of revolutionary socialists don't believe in reforms, the quote Peterson used even mentioned it in the beginning! You can't debate or engage someone who is arguing in bad faith, because they just make stuff up as they go. Third, which has less to do with the talk I watched, but nonetheless is the consensus around here, is that Peterson has a lot of support amongst the alt-right and other sections of the right. Nationalists, Alt-righters, fascists, etc., are like the mortal enemies of anarchists, as they stand for all the opposite things we stand for.

I'm not sure if you're trolling or not, but I'll just say this - Anarchism is the belief that all hierarchies are dangerous, this includes capitalism, the state, and representative democracy. Most left-libertarians believe in this as well. Right-libertarians think capitalism is good, and for some reason, trust it when they already distrust other oppressive hierarchies.

I'm certainly not upset at Bush's death, don't get me wrong, but I don't get the sense of pleasure that others seem to when people like this die. Perhaps it's that I'm neither American, nor an inhabitant of any country the US invaded during Bush's tenure, and that I was born after his Presidency ended. I'm not sure.

She led the Left SRs into alliance with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, but was imprisoned for a time and incarcerated in a mental sanitarium after the Left SRs broke with the Bolsheviks in 1918. Spiridonova was arrested by the secret police during the Great Purge of 1937 to 1939 and consigned to the forced labor camps of the Gulag, where she was summarily executed shortly after the outbreak of World War II late in the summer of 1941.

All that, and we haven't even started on the political establishment's role in this yet... Do we have a solution to that? No. We have a way toward building a society where *all of that* can, hopefully, not exist in the first place. But stopping that while it's in full flow? I don't see how.",t3_a942vr,Anarchism

While we can't just correct peoples thoughts, those power structures can and should be changed by people organizing in opposition to them.

I think if anarchism starts in a bottom up way, these issues are sorted out as you go communally and it's a work in process that effectively creates horizontal power structures. If instead, you just got rid of all the laws one day without any large anarchist movement that is creating anarchist communities and forms of non-hierarchical coordination, then things might go badly.

"This is the sort of sloppy faux journalism that passes for critique at clickbait sites/pubs like @Nymag. When your extended metaphor cracks and breaks early, hacks like this rely on snark, bogus logic and pithy subheads to reach their allotted word count. The minor crime of crap thinking and writing like this is to actually gloss over the endemic fraudulence of the digital ecosystem with the dismissiveness of an hysteric jokester. Beneath the breathless examples of unconnected corruptions there actually lies a shared engine of violence: capital's inexorable pull towards its own excrutiating limit of selfserving profit. What unites the litany of phenomena namechecked here is not some varying degree of 'falsity'. Such comparative standards of proof were thankfully abolished by the insights of advancing philosophy (see Deleuze, Lyotard and as one poster above suggests, Baudrillard). What unites them is our very human need to be assured, duped, coddled and nurtured by the stimulus that affirms. As long as we each continue to plug back in each day to this dazzling hyper-commercialized factory-store-supplychain of experience and value exchange seeking panicky validation we remain willing and essential ingredients in this simulation as marketplace. To complain about our disappointment in the elusiveness of 'truth' betrays a fatal naivete. The evolving system is increasingly resilient to threats to its aim towards infinite growth. Designed as it is with capital's profit incentive as heart, brain, lungs and veins, it spits out superficial japeries like this every couple of weeks to keep the sheep guessing about where the big bad wolves are hiding. But the 'truth', (if there is one, and there isn't ), is that our idiot need for truth is the fatal flaw which both powers our complicity and reveals our duplicity. I'm surprised this shallow wag didn't trot out the au currant canard of 'we are the product'. That's one of the bones - the feints - the platform-as-world (PaW) tossed our way recently to assauge and explain away our increasingly debilitating anxieties. But it's worse than that, of course, otherwise the ever cooperative neolib press wouldn't have suggested it: we've become the currency itself.

"If you can't carry your own costs—whether individually or through association—then you're an exploiter. That's pretty simple. And if the people around you understand that you are unwilling to carry your own costs, then there's nothing in an anarchist society that forces them to put up with it, particularly as will have, through that very unwillingness, revealed yourself as an adversary. If no hierarchy is introduced to *sanction the privilege* of saying 'fuck all y'all' and shrugging off the costs imposed on others, then there's absolutely no reason to expect those who are going to have to bear the costs to accept them willingly. The Bundy family, of course, want the dual sanction of government and God, appealing to a particular theocratic interpretation of the US Constitution. And I don't think there's much doubt that anarchists have very little use for government sanctions, even when the separation of church and state is maintained. As far as 'economic resources' go, the issue is precisely that ranchers are using resources that are ill-suited to the uses they wish to make of them, while those uses conflict with the primary uses for which much of that land has been set aside. In the capitalist context, if the ranchers can't pay a price for the use that compensates the nation for the losses in other land-management uses, then allowing them continued use is hardly *economical* for most of those with a stake in the larger land-use questions. In an anarchist society, of course, these kinds of questions won't be passed on to a government, but will have to be part of the criteria for all land-use decisions. That should ultimately make our land use more efficient, as problems can often be addressed much closer to their scattered sources, rather than only really being addressed when they impinge on property held in common—and then often in competition with concessions to capitalist property norms even there. In a world where no one has a 'property right' to create downstream effects to the detriment of their neighbors, near or far off, then we'll almost certainly find that 'empty' land pays higher returns in many areas than the 'mixed uses' of federal lands that land-grabbers consider such terrible 'overreaches.' But, seriously, no anarchist can really defend dominionist 'patriots' who just want the government to back up their privilege. ",t3_a2kmuh,Anarchism

The Turkish public seems to be almost unanimously in support of the invasion, and I don't think that's just a product of the fascist propaganda and media control there, so the military resources being prepared for the invasion are massive and probably overwhelming. The only factor that's extremely different from Afrin is that the city wad handed over without a fight, whereas it's likely that almost all of the fighting in Jazira and Kobani would be urban, which is something that the YPG might have more experience in after Kobani, Manbij, and especially Raqqa.

"Industrial monocultures bypass nature by growing in sterile soil fed by a steady drip of petrochemicals. The soil is literally dead; all the natural organisms that live in and feed the soil have been killed. All the native plant and animal life that previously thrived in the ecosystem has been exterminated so that nothing can interfere with the cash crop's monopoly. The crop is planted in vast rows of genetically-identical monocultures. Each row is drenched in herbicides so nothing but the crop can survive. Food production that destroys the ecosystem and can only exist under industrial capitalism has no place in anarchy. People that attack other people's intellect because they're threatened by an indigenous farmer's defense of natural ecosystems have no place in anarchy. Our ecosystem isn't our enemy. We don't need to dominate it and beat it into submission so it can provide for us. This frame of thinking is what brought us the genocidal nightmares of colonialism, slavery, capitalism, and now the ongoing mass extinction event that is wiping out all life on the planet. People starve under capitalism. Industrial agriculture doesn't stop people from starving. It forces indigenous people off their land. It pollutes our water. Destroys our food sources. Imprisons us. Poisons us. Starves us. All the famines in recent history resulted from industrial agriculture. The dust bowl, the Holodomor, the Irish potato famine. These were all manmade disasters.

Cut to the next store manager the year in question: 'no, I'm afraid we need everyone here to help with the transition out of Christmas and into New Year's/Valentine's. If you want to take off, I'll approve anything after the 28th.' So I get approved for like the 28th through the 2nd, come into work after having Christmas Day off and spending it completely alone, and we don't do any of the post-holiday reset. Next day, no reset.

Masters emphasize that they care for their slaves, abusive husbands that they love their wives, bosses that they value their workers, cops that they love their neighborhoods.

A 'good' landlord is not one that charges a bit less or pays for some repairs.

"What? No. I worked in various grocers for over a decade, in management and non-management rolls, in union and non-union shops. It never works that way. Here's some more information on the financials of the grocery world because I am so tired of seeing this rhetoric. Every department usually has their target sales, target margin, target shrink, and labor is based off of sales in whatever way the company chooses (hours or money by % of sales, typically). Sales is what you're going to sell, most likely, based on projections (current store trend over last year). These are set fairly far in advance, but usually get changed every four to sixteen weeks if you're varying from it too much in either direction. Gross margin is how much of those sales will be profit, on average (so if my micro-bakery has a 50% margin target, I sell some ten loaves of bread for $4 that cost $2, two vendor specialty items for $6 that cost $5, and four cakes for $30 that cost $8 my margin is 64% before losses; the role of margin versus labor and importance of product mix could be discussed here but w/e). Adjusted gross margin takes into account two very important things. What you know you spoiled (for example, 8%, for out of date items, damaged things unable to get credit, sampled items, donated items not paid for by a marketing/community department) and unknown (for example, 2%, for theft, accounting/invoicing discrepancies, detrimental fluctuation in cost of goods variables like fresh fruit, having to substitute out of stocks from more expensive vendors, or price reductions on short dated items). You figure this out by thorough record keeping, like monthly inventory, updating costs of goods and accuracy of recipes, and daily spoilage logging. It's fucking tedious. And it is never, ever an immediate knowledge - you're really only looking at this in depth once a month. All of this to say... Companies would have to significantly increase their staffing to stay on top of all that data, truly maintain its accuracy, and put in some pretty damn illegal practices to hold employees accountable for 'missing items'. To some extent, as a manager, repeatedly missing targets is a bad thing and you'll have lots of conversations about it and how to 'fix it', but they're sure as shit not docking your paycheck over it, forget about any clerk-level staff. The amount of even 1 basis point - which is a variance of .01% - would be more than I even made to begin with.

In the Middle Ages, they took the name of serfs: nowadays they are called wage earners. The position of the latter group has a great deal more dignity attached to it, and it is less hard than that of slaves, but they are nonetheless forced, by hunger as well as by political and social institutions, to maintain other people in complete or relative idleness, through their own exceedingly hard labor. Consequently they are slaves. And in general, no state, ancient or modern, has ever managed or will ever manage to get along without the forced labor of the masses, either wage earners or slaves, as a principal and absolutely necessary foundation for the leisure, the liberty, and the civilization of the political class—the citizens.” Bakunin ",t3_a55bsn,Anarchism

">until one of these things sees actual use I might be pissing against the wind for saying this in this sub, but if the protesters executed *anyone* with the guillotine, they'd be compared to ISIS immediately by mainstream media and would be both demonized and attacked with counter-terrorist measures. I'm against capital punishment overall (not unlike Maximilian Robespierre), but one way I *could* see a guillotine sending an effective message would be if a popular revolt captured the government and a big-time politician or corporate leader were executed after a fully-legitimate judicial process (a la the French Revolution, minus the kangaroo courts). States and courts are an enemy of freedom, yes, but chaotic violence is not a winning message - especially not when the media is controlled.

The old masters prove that Liberalism is just playing catch up with the ideas espoused over 100 years ago. The only source materials I recommend to people are the Conquest of Bread and Anarchism and other Essays, because I think those two are very approachable and paint a grand picture of what Anarchism could be.

'Anarcho'-capitalists are not considered anarchists by anarchists.

Anarcho-capitalism dates from the mid 1970s when Rothbard first used the term to annoy leftists.

When we simply say 'Oh I don't believe in conspiracies' (despite the fact that they obviously happen-- covert operations happen, terrorists conspire, legally-designated conspiracies are prosecuted on a daily basis, the wealthy conspire together to pursue their class interests-- conspiracies are not unusual), we cede a whole range of important issues to the people who will handle them the most loosely and insanely and validate the powerful and the media who seek to discredit any attempt to address them. And that's not all it does-- by refusing to even touch that whole range of subjects, we cede ALL the many people who are aware of them to the right wing. If you're someone who notices inconsistencies and glaring holes in the media's and the state's portrayals of events, if you're someone who *does* approach these subjects rationally and has fair reasons for reaching their conclusions, and who wants to support political movements that will treat them like a sane person and actually address these issues, are you more likely to support the right (who may play fast and loose with their interpretation of the facts on these subjects, but who at least are willing to say, 'Yes, conspiracies happen, you aren't crazy, and we want to prosecute the elites who are behind them,' or the left, if the left's general position is to just mock anyone for believing that maybe fire and gravity alone can't turn two 110 story and one 52 story steel-framed high-rises completely to dust (full of nanothermite and the residue of its ignition) and tiny fragments of steel at almost free-fall in seconds. If you're someone who has actually done research on a subject like this and come to an informed conclusion, and what seems like an entire political wing assume they know better while refusing to engage with the evidence, it's not surprising that you come to see them as an out-group. I can totally sympathize with that; personally, I was very politically engaged before I ever became interested in any of those subjects, and had very strongly-held ideals (not to mention I'd already been exposed to left-wing thinkers who didn't outright dismiss 'conspiracy theories,' and who actually theoretically accounted for them, like Michael Parenti), but if 9/11 Truth or something like that was my first political engagement, I can see how that would make me see us as irrational. And I think that many of those people would otherwise be perfectly open to our values (9/11 Truth activists certainly don't have any love for Bush and the neocons, but if the alt-right claims they don't either and also sucks them into QAnon bullshit, they might just buy it, because at least those people will hear them out. Just wanted to put it out there. We should really consider these theories like any theory, on their own merits; if they don't hold water then don't take them seriously, but it's a mistake to just assume that because something isn't in the media, or sounds shocking, or is labeled a 'conspiracy theory' that it couldn't be true. And the murder of innocent activists is just one example which I guarantee you the right-wing media (and maybe the liberal media) will claim is just some crazy paranoid speculation that couldn't possibly be true, because *our government wouldn't just KILL Americans!* Its precisely systemic structural and historical analysis that proves that absolutely our state has and will kill its own citizens when it suits them.

"Gen. Augusto Pinochet's death on Dec. 10 means the Bush Family can breathe a little bit easier, knowing that criminal proceedings against Chile's notorious dictator can no longer implicate his longtime friend and protector, former President George H.W. Bush. Although Chilean investigations against other defendants may continue, the cases against Pinochet end with his death of a heart attack at the age of 91. Pinochet's death from natural causes also marks a victory for world leaders, including George H.W. and George W. Bush, who shielded Pinochet from justice over the past three decades. Over those intervening 30 years, Pinochet allegedly engaged in a variety of illicit operations, including terrorism, torture, murder, drug trafficking, money-laundering and illicit arms shipments – sometimes with the official collusion of the U.S. government. In the 1980s, when George H.W. Bush was Vice President, Pinochet's regime helped funnel weapons to the Nicaraguan contra rebels and to Saddam Hussein's Iraq, an operation that also implicated then-CIA official Robert M. Gates, who will be the next U.S. Secretary of Defense.' ",t3_a22rgf,Anarchism

"People here have already pointed out that left-right usually refers to economic models, with left being socialism and right being capitalism. The author of *Anarchism: From Theory to Practice* (1970), David Guérin, uses an important dichotomy within socialism: Anarchists were *libertarian* socialists whereas Marxists were *authoritarian* socialists. They're all anti-capitalist. There was a schism between these from the beginning, in the First International, etc. Guérin wrote from a more classical anarchist viewpoint (syndicalism, mutualism, anarcho-communism). He put the distinction into use when explaining early events in the Russian Revolution. The *soviets* intuitively organized themselves in accordance with *libertarian* socialist (anarchist) principles, running the factories as free associations of workers, but the *authoritarian* Bolsheviks did not agree and eventually took power, oppressed the anarchists, and laid the foundation for the infamous dictatorship.

"Throwing out some thoughts: Anarchy goes so well with feminism. Feminism is a widespread movement to abolish the unjust hierarchy of patriarchy. Looking back to the beginnings of capitalism I read about the accumulation of capital through the exploitation of women: their labor was devalued and their land taken. Many peasant revolts had a huge percentage of women in them and even heading them. Looking through the lens of feminism, we can more clearly see how capitalism continued to exploit women to this day. . But reading Federici's Caliban and the Witch helped me cement that I should keep my tie to feminism while also being an anarchist. I would hope that 'An injury to one is an injury to all' holds up with respect to women in the workplace and having more anarchists jump onto harrassment and #metoo type of stories of bosses holding power over women and causing physical violence. Similarly, feminism can become a spring board for seeing and abolishing more unjust hierarchies besides patriarchy. ",t3_a7kgz1,Anarchism

We’d provide safe places for people to consume drugs, healthcare (including mental health), and drug production would not be done for profit meaning drugs wouldn’t contain harmful additives that are commonly used to cut the product (such as brickdust!).

"Anarchism is against coercion and hierarchies by extension, we are against the government and corporations. Socialism is where the workers own and control the means of production. Anarchism is against the private ownership of the means of production because it leads to hierarchies, coercion, and the hoarding of resources/wealth. Anarcho-individualists believe each worker should own their own means of production. Anarcho-communists believe the means of production should be communally owned by the workers. Where each worker may use the means of production to produce for themselves and the commune. Anarcho-syndicalists believe the means of production should be owned by workers collectives who organize like a non-hierarchical business. The current workers control who may join their collective (through direct democracy). All of the above are socialist and we don’t consider the “state socialists” of the USSR or social democrats (like Bernie) to be socialist at all.

"So Stalin was a right prick - I think many Communists know that. What I think is their problem with anti-Stalin arguments (I mean aside from those weirdos who still call Stalin 'little father of the peoples') is that focusing on Stalin has been the main point and emphasis of the anti-communist argument from the Right. So, in my country (Greece) communists were violently persecuted for many years after the civil war (tortured and sent to exile) the main propaganda against them being that they wanted to install Stalinism. For the purposes of propaganda, Stalin was presented as even worse than he really was (taken out of context), practically a devil incarnate, in order to push the argument that all communists are in his image. Even to this day, you'll hear 'Stalin' mentioned in far-right propaganda against anyone left-of-center. Now I'd rather die than defend Stalinism in any way and banning you sure was a dick move, but I'm trying to give an explanation of why Communists are so sensitive and the answer is aggressive Right-wing anti-communist Discourse.

"It's so sad not only that they've been used as pawns by western powers since decades ago (that asshat Thierry Meyssan still propagates the idea that the kurds owe some kind of allegiance to that gray-haired convention which established a profitable Kurdistan for the West in the 30's/40's) but even now, when kurds and their language are facing extinction and they're fighting all the pigs on boths sides like Makhno did, they get labelled as selfish and useful tools by certain 'revolutionary' milieus. If you like history books, you'll probably know the US made a coup d'État in Syria in the 40's as well, only two decades after Lenin betrayed Ukraine. It was also related to resources, a pipeline if I recall correctly. Curiously enough, almost the very same territory which was in dispute when the Red Army backstabbed the makhnovists is the same territory that stood up as 'rebel prorussian' a few years ago. Don't get me wrong, I shit on the West and on Russia's neowarsawist oligarchs, and I have enough remaining shit for many other countries. I only mention this example to show something not so different happened to the 'western-backed' Kurdistan from those days (the one not only Meyssan, but lots of marxist-leninists seem to endorse nowadays). Turkey's role is just too obvious, remember how they used to open their borders for ISIS fighters and how they handed them over those nice passports. Erdogan's narrative about the kurds is as faked as his sympathy for palestinians. It sucks that they're forced to take obsolete american weapons (you know, those you're gonna need to use in 10 or 20 years to fight themselves) and it sucks how Putin played that neo-ottomanist turd into buying his weapons.

Libertarian socialism, anarchism, and the likes are part of a long philosophical tradition that includes many of the ideas the founding fathers held. They do connect. That being said, this thinking can really only go so far. The ideology behind the American Revolution may be a good starting point for a conversation, but as you noted, there are some strong fundamental differences between the beliefs of the founding fathers and LibSocs that will be hard to get around.",t3_a3j78h,Anarchism

"In my opinion, any argument made in favor of capitalism that could also be made in favor of feudalism or state socialism ought to be discarded. All three are authoritarian systems where non-coerced agreements between worker and ruler are impossible due to massive power imbalances. Labor under all three systems could just as easily be argued to be mutually beneficial. You work, and in exchange the party bureaucrat, noble, or capitalist compensates you in some fashion that allows you to not die/be homeless. Given that there are rarely any consequences for a ruler discarding or failing to utilize a particular worker, but frequently severe consequences for a worker being discarded or not picking from a limited number of options (if they even have more than one option), I find all such agreements coercive. Therefore, all three systems ought to be considered tyranny. Merit does not justify tyranny. I'm sure Stalin worked hard and used a great deal of talent to seize control of the USSR. Does his merit justify his position? If not, then why does merit justify the capitalist's position? Social mobility does not justify tyranny. Under feudalism a peasant could be knighted or marry into the nobility. Under state socialism you just need to become a party bureaucrat or develop some skill that makes you more highly valued. Regardless, the ability to move from exploited worker to tyrant does not matter to me. Inheritance does not justify tyranny. If someone who never worked a day in their life gets a piece of paper from a dead relative that says they own a factory/feudal plot, and that numerous workers have to enrich them to avoid risk of starvation through leaving their job/fleeing, why should I respect that piece of paper? If instead of inheritance that capitalist/noble worked hard to obtain their position, that goes back to the merit argument above. Risk does not justify tyranny. Every time the capitalist invests, they risk losing that investment. Every time a bureaucrat tries to climb the party's hierarchy, they risk the gulag if they upset the wrong people. Nobles have even more risk, given the possibility of bloodshed when they come into conflict. Regardless, for the capitalist the absolute worst case scenario is becoming a worker. Why should workers care? Walking over a metaphorical snake pit on a tightrope not impressive when the vast majority of the global population spend their entire lives in that pit. Political and economic hierarchy are an engine of chaos in society. The people at the top will inevitably break whatever rules a system has in any high reward / low risk situation. Expecting capitalists to follow the Non-Aggression Principle out of altruism in a situation where they can profit from violating it without being discovered is untenable. For their part, workers will always resent laboring to make others rich while they live with few meaningful options, and this will inevitably drive many of them outside the NAP due to desperation. Capitalism works in theory, just as state socialism does. Or more accurately, they both work under falsified theories. Capitalism without a state to enforce it is impossible because political power will shift from the governments to massive, land-owning corporations. These corps will effectively become states in their own right. Despite frequent assertions I have seen to the contrary, capitalism is not human nature. Following the NAP out of altruism when one can get away with breaking it is not either. The fact that political and economic hierarchy leads to a vicious struggle for power and resources where laws or principles are inevitably circumvented *is* human nature. This is why feudalism does not work, why state socialism does not work, why the capitalist democracies don't work, and why capitalism without a state would not work if such a thing were ever attempted. Though I don't believe it ever will be attempted on a large scale, as most capitalists are aware that the state is a useful mechanism for enforcing rent-seeking and wage labor without getting their own hands dirty. I should mention that I'm unlikely to respond if you only address one or two of my points and ignore the rest. Every debate I've had with a capitalism supporter to date has used that bad-faith approach. If you can't refute all my arguments, there's not much sense in spending your time or mine in a debate. I wish I could think of a way to phrase what I just wrote that does not come off as rude, but I can't so I'll just apologize in advance if things get heated due to my impatience and previous bad experiences with debating capitalism supporters.",t3_a8j9ia,Anarchism

">At that time in the UK, WW2 ended and it was the beginning of the cold war. People had a fear for WW3 and nuclear bombs and also felt a crisis for the Soviet Union and communism. George Orwell noticed that and wrote *Animal Farm* and *1984*. Halas and Batchelor must have had the same thoughts as Orwell. Halas was a Jew from Hungary. I guess he exiled himself from Hungary and went to the UK. During the war his homeland was occupied by the Nazis and after that by the Soviet Union. A totalitarian tyranny existed there and he surely felt such a reality in *Animal Farm*. *Animal Farm* had a nowadays theme for him. I think he wanted to depict the ugliness of dictatorship. >However, exploitation is not only found in communism, capitalism is a system just like that. **I believe a company is common property of the people that work there.** But that is a socialistic idea. Nowadays, American style capitalism has become mainstream. The stock holders have voices and change managers to get more profit in the current term. In addition to that, they downsize or restructure regular employees and enlarge temporary workers and part time workers. For them, temporary workers are just disposable. On the other hand, regular employees also are completely exhausted in hard work. Such a system is quite *Animal Farm*like. >Its scheme used to be common sense to the world. Now, everyone has forgotten about that. Everyone assumes he or she is in middle-class and blinded by the mechanism of exploitation. At a time, during the economic growth after the war, business managers also had to work hard. Because of its graduated taxation, the income gap In Japan was small. Before the bubble years, our society was like that and they didn't feel the reality on exploitation. But all were crushed by the burst bubble. Lifelong employment and seniority system were thrown away. Efficiency pay and target settings were brought. In my opinion these efficiency pays will bring workers nervous diseases. **It is obvious that talented people must do their best at work without thinking about its return.** Don't work for money.

You, having arrived by whatever means at the decision to reject that system, do not fit within it so easily anymore. Here's the thing, though; This byproduct of capitalism is welcomed. Depressed people don't demonstrate. Depressed people don't vote. People who leave their jobs aren't sticking around to get their fellow workers to unionize. First, you should get mad. Go for a long walk/jog/run. Tire yourself out, get good and out of breath, then take a shower. Clean like you're getting ready for your wedding, then go get a few lines in the water for work. You can't fight if you can't get yourself taken care of. Your depression might have deep, personal roots, but the system is using it to keep you in line. Every early morning with brushed teeth and good grooming is a refusal. Anything that keeps you from laying in bed and watching bullshit on Netflix becomes an act of resistance. Get that good wage back and save up to form a collectivist Web Dev company. Get some sympathetic people in your field and someone who knows their way around accounting and start it as a side gig. Draft a corporate constitution giving each member equal share of the company and elect your executives. It will be tiny and slow, but if you can build it big enough to make a living, you've escaped a little capitalist oppression, and can start teaching others.

If someone from my community is into that I'll respect them, if white people make them feel comfortable and that's who they're around because they're friendly and have common interests, no problem. Of course most Latino cultures prefer to add white people into their families, that's a whole different mess tho. Still, in the hood I wouldn't be letting the homies give shit to people trying to do their own thing. Which I've definitely seen them try to, and that's unacceptable. Live and let live. On the flip side, I'm very respectful of my mexican roots. I always like to think of embracing them not as an act of pride, but as an act of respect. Whether or not you choose to practice cultural norms in music/food/art.. whatever. I myself speak english with an accent, I listen to mexican folk music and love it, I dress up in boots and 'tejana'. I got family members that don't do any of that and I get along great with them. Better than a lot of others even. It wasn't always like that tho. People have criticized me for the way I am.

"I think it's dangerous to see your opponents as 'stupid,' or 'misguided,' because that ignores the reality that plenty of people are well-informed, intelligent and working towards a goal we don't agree with. Take a look at our environment. I don't live in the US, but even here anarchy isn't even on the political table. And the only Marxist party frequently gets decried as too extreme. For almost everyone, capitalism is a fact of life. Every piece of media that gets made portrays capitalism as inevitable and natural. That's an environment where it's hard to think about an alternative even existing. You also have a lot of rich and powerful people and organizations putting in a ton of resources in keeping the status quo or shifting it further to the right because it benefits them. Then you also have everyday people who are fully aware how terrible their lifestyle is for the planet and most of the people living on it, but experience a form of cognitive dissonance that causes them to double down. They also believe that changing the status quo will hurt their status or standards of living, and they're unwilling to give that up. Being an anarchist can be exhaustive sometimes, even if you don't organize. Your beliefs are challenged at every turn, the awareness of all the bad things going in can be draining, and you have no choice but participate in a system you strongly disagree with.

"The problem with using money to determine people's needs and wants is that not everybody has money. Advocates of the Austrian school of economics tell us that money is a particle responsible for carrying price signals, which are then used to determine how to distribute and allocate scarce resources. In other words, they believe that money is a form of communication, or a form of speech. These followers of Austrianism (let's call them Austrianites) are technically correct, but what they don't tell us is that when there is a vast disparity in the amount of money that people have, then some people will be able to send a much greater volume of price signals than other people, and some people won't be able to send price signals at all. In a situation like that, the obscenely wealthy will be able to make their economic “voices” heard louder than anyone else, and their voices will drown out the voices of those who have less wealth. When money is speech, the poor are silenced. And when people are silenced, left unable to communicate their needs within the framework of their socioeconomic system, then those people are placed into a situation where they are at risk of starving to death even when surrounded by abundance. The capitalist economic system ignores these people because capitalism is only listening for price signals, which is a type of signal that these people do not have the ability to send. And if you ignore the economic needs and wants of too many people for too long, eventually they will rise up in rebellion, because doing otherwise would mean starving to death. ☠",t3_a8p4kt,Anarchism

">The illusion of a closed, compact, uniform, pure and fixed Anarchism, like the immaculate faith in the absolute, could live within the enthusiasms of the moment, in febrile imaginations, anxious for goodness and justice, but it is exhausted by truth and reason. It dies fatally when the understanding is clarified and analysis breaks down the heart of the ideality. And the supreme moment comes to shatter our beliefs, to break up the ideological clutter acquired from this or that author, in love with one or another social or philosophical thesis. Why hide it? Why continue to fight in the name of pseudo-scientific and semiological puerilities? Truth is not enclosed in an exclusive point of view. It is not guarded in an ark of fragile planks. It is not there at hand or at the reach of the first daring soul who decides to discover it. As the sciences, as everything human is in formation, it will be perpetually in formation. We are and will always be forced to follow after it through successive trials; in that no other way is the flow of knowledge formed and certainty established. >This is how Anarchism will be surpassed. And when I speak of Anarchism and I say that in minds something stirs that is incomprehensible to the dying world, and that we sense beyond the ANARCHY a sun, which is born because in the succession of time there is no sunset without orthography, I speak of Doctrinal Anarchism, which forms schools, raises chapels and builds altars. Yes; beyond this necessary moment of the bankruptcy of beliefs, is the broad anarchist synthesis that gathers from all the particularisms that are maintained, from all philosophical theses, and from all the formidable advances of the common intellectual work, the established and well-checked truths, whose demonstration every struggle is already impossible. This vast synthesis, a complete expression of Anarchism that opens its doors to everything that comes from tomorrow and everything that remains firm and strong from yesterday and is reaffirmed in today’s clash that scrutinizes the unknown,—this synthesis is the complete denial of all belief. \---Ricardo 'Adjective Annihilator' Mella: ",t3_a1ylkb,Anarchism

"I have sincere problems with anyone using my skin color and or gender as an accusation of bigotry. It's not like anyone chooses to their skin color or gender. Transgender people do not 'choose' their gender. They choose to *live* as the gender they were born with instead of the one they were assigned at birth. I would argue that even though not experiencing the discrimination women face, when you are a man, does not exclude sympathy. And furthermore trans people face discrimination of their social gender, as well as transphobia. Transgender women do not appropriate 'womanhood'. They are women in men's bodies amd denying them their right to live as the gender they feel they are, confirms the notion of sex and gender being inarguably tied. I believe that almost all men contribute to oppression to some degree (in)voluntarily. On the other hand, so do women against other women. Speaking of slutshaming, blaming them for their career choices, saying that women are inferior to men. Sexism occurs on both sides (Centrism Trademark) Toxic masculinity oppresses both genders, so do a lot of women. (I dare speak of toxic femininity, because most people misunderstand my point, when I argue that toxic femininity is just the the other side of toxic masculinity which both stem from conservative gender roles) I advise not to be insultive, that would lead you nowhere, but insist on your right and your obligation to be critical of gender and that excluding trans people would reinforce the same gender roles that we were forced in for millennia. My first language is german. I've been told that my sentence structure strongly resembles german syntax. I hope everything is clear. Edit: I am not the type of person who believes that feminism is an exclusive term and that it should be replaced with egalitarianism. However I believe that toxic masculinity should always be seen in relation to 'toxic femininity' meaning women oppressing themselves because of internalized ideas of womanhood. It should be overall replaced by toxic gender roles as 'masculine'/'feminine' expectations of their own or the other gender are equally as bad. Or we continue to refer to this toxicity as sexism as we did for decades.",t3_a6f0mn,Anarchism

">Well, I mean, if we’re going to pretend that we can have any idea what goes on in the brains of animals at the moment of death, then we can pretend to the contrary of your point as well. If you had said this one or two hundred years ago, when people were more inclined to believe that animals are closer to automata than sentient beings, you might have had a point, but in this day and age it's just sophomoric and scientifically illiterate. To be frank. We know that animals experience pain and distress. They have hormonal and neurological reactions similar to our own. From there, the question moves beyond mere pain and becomes one of the violation of bodily integrity and natural interests, like the interest to live. This is more purely the domain of ethical speculation; science can tell us how the world is but it can't tell us how to act; but I think we can arrive at some solid conclusions. We assume that it is wrong to kill a human under ordinary circumstances, even if we do so without causing them any pain, even if they could be said to enjoy the experience, because we are violating their ability to continue living. Conserving the interest to live is not an objective fact, and it may not be something we can argue for. It's a commitment, and has to be stipulated. If we can't agree on that commitment there's no possibility of agreeing further down the line. The only way you can get away with condoning the killing of animals—especially for a selfish reason like enjoying the taste of their flesh—is to invent an alternate reality founded on the belief that animals are fundamentally different from humans, do not have internal lives, desires, and feelings, and therefore do not deserve consideration of their interests—which again, is a reality not borne out by modern science or even our day-to-day experience with animals that we call our pets. So I'm not *pretending* to know anything. I'm taking what evidence we have from science about the sentience of non-human animals to arrive at an ethical framework. Lastly, even if we knew nothing about what animals actually thought or felt, or whether they could think and feel at all, we would still not be justified in killing them for food when alternatives exist. It would be ethically preferable to err on the side of causing less harm until we had a clearer picture of the existence or non-existence of non-human consciousness. &#x200B; >As a human, I still am legitimately terrified of being eaten by a wild animal and it’s (generally) a pretty unlikely scenario; So how do you square this statement with: >there is even anecdotal evidence to support the idea that humans feel an overwhelming peace at the moment of death ??

"I’ve been amongst several of these riots, not on purpose, and I’ve heard this argument before about what sort of things get smashed but from my experience that’s not nearly the whole truth and completely void or any sort of desirable moral code that I can see. First of all once mob mentality takes over, things are smashed indiscriminately, I’ve had friends entire mom and pop shop businesses looted and destroyed. So while a Starbucks might be one target, that is by no means a fair representation of what really happens. Secondly, a luxury car is subjective, and you have no idea what the circumstances are behind the ownership of that vehicle. The person who owns it could be in a mountain of debt to it, it could be a lease, it could be someone really loves cars and saved up for years for it, it could have irreplaceable family photos or other important items in it. It could end up catching a house nearby on fire and hurt or kill people. Someone might be pregnant and come out to rush to the hospital only to find their vehicle destroyed. The lack of humanity and thought behind doing that to someone is unfathomable and completely undermines any noble intention you think you may have. Not to mention the environmental impact of destroying things that will just be replaced with causing all the same impact to be repeated. I just don’t get how you don’t get that. Thirdly, I agree that there’s mass scale corruption in virtually all government institutions those institutions will always exist in some form or another. Take the police for example, some form of justice serving organization of human beings is going to have to exist in order to protect the weak and prevent terrible people from doing terrible things. This idea that some time from the past was better is a fantasy. We have police because there are shitty people out there who will kill you and rape your wife just for the fun of it. If you think that if we could just kill capitalism, that everyone would all of a sudden play nice and we don’t need police any more, than you have clearly never looked into the eyes of really bad people. Unfortunately I have. They exist. Some form of policing is necessary. And back to taking about the British empire and progress, like that was then, you can’t compare it today. We can’t keep looking to the past and cherry picking all the fun stuff, reframed and romanticized. We live in a technological dream scape right now the likes never before seen in history. The past can’t help us. We need to evolve not revolve. To build on top of and fix what we have, not destroy. Even the Starbucks you smash, you think your fighting for the cause but in reality your just destroying someones place of employment, taking out of work inflating insurance premiums. The real effects of those actions effect real peoples lives and they don’t help anyone. It’s not like you’re sticking around offering people new jobs or alternative means of supporting themselves. You just smash it up and then run away. And all of this aggressive behaviour has the attitude of forcing your ideology upon the masses with violence, so how is that different from fascism?

Ok. I loathe forced hierarchies. However my belief is that people who hold views opposite to mine are best dealt with by debating. Polite debate if possible. I went and saw the original posters posts. Lots of stuff in Iranian. Some of it was extremely rude and hostile to other people so the person's a bit of a tool. There was one recent post in the MGTOW where he used this horrible new term THOT. I only heard of this a few weeks back - and yes I am appalled. I adore women and find his remarks to be repugnant. Having said that wouldn't it be better if he ever tried to express such disgraceful views on the r/Anarchist forums that he then would be confronted with the foolishness in the brutal manner that I sometimes see here? My view is that by not offering a potential alternative you just let the person wander around life retaining the stupid views they hold. Wouldn't it be better to confront them with the reality that the views can have real negative impact on others? ,t3_a6tquf,Anarchism

">He respects the animals he kills Even when I ate meat I never understood how this sentiment made any sense. Imagine walking over to your neighbors and disclosing that you'd just killed and eaten their son. &#x200B; 'But it's okay!' you assure them. 'I honored and respected him and have used as much of his body as I was able to.' &#x200B; Okay. Obviously that's a bit of a stretch. As humans, the lives of other humans mean more in most circumstances than the lives of non-human animals. They aren't the same thing. But I think what that scenario reveals is that those notions of respect and honor have more to do with making use of a resource (and the underlying assumption that animals are just that: resources for us) than any notion of morality or ethics, even though they may be articulated as such. Moreover, we shudder at the thought of eating another person, who has feelings, thoughts, desires, social connections, and we delude our consciences with the belief (by now scientifically disproven) that animals have none of these. &#x200B; While it's commendable that your father is cognizant and sympathetic enough to recognize the plight of factory farm animals, I don't see how killing an animal which he believes is leading a better—who knows, perhaps at that moment great—life is somehow ethical.

I'd be grouping somebody with people who struggle mentally, and if used in a derogatory sense, implying that being ill-minded is a bad thing and those people are lesser than me. &#x200B; Of course, that's not what I mean to do should I use the word 'stupid'. It's just supposed to be a gentle jab. However, 'retarded' and 'stupid' both have VERY different stigmas around them, but when you dissect them, they're insults that mean the exact same thing. &#x200B; The same applies should somebody say 'gay' instead of 'fag'. The implication that being gay is bad is present. The thing is, a lot of time when these words are used, they're never meant to be looked at that deep. &#x200B; Much fewer people get offended at the word 'stupid' than the word 'retarded'. I worry that this is a case of people being offended on behalf of others. &#x200B; I think the nature of insulting someone is to put them in a lower class than you, ultimately, which is implying that people of that lower class are worse than you. But so often people don't mean this much depth to their insults. It's very often supposed to be juvenile fun. I get that words hurt and we should absolutely respect if somebody doesn't want to hear a certain word, but if calling a friend 'retarded' is bad and destructive, from my understanding, so is insulting them in literally any way. Obviously, the intensity varies, but in keeping our thought process consistent, every insult is bad, ever, even when done privately with friends. &#x200B; I'm open to the idea that I'm completely wrong, but please elaborate on why. I'm genuinely curious about this topic, and I fear that others are seeing me as somebody who just loves to insult everybody, ever, and I'm an awful person but that's not the case.

Everyone boycotting Chick-fil-A does, I think we agree. If no one bought a Ford, Ford would collapse no matter how many Fords a corporation bought. It's the 'How do you get people to boycott Chick-fil-A?' question that most anarchists or even most leftists in general get so awfully wrong. Typically, their answer is 'movement building and organizing'. 'Raising awareness'. 'Educating'. This is futile. Leftists somehow always think that because 'the whole world is watching', that will translate into real action on the part of every day average people. When their movements are ultimately giant failures, co-opted by liberals or crushed by cops or whatever, they always say 'well at least we raised awareness', and as proof that their ideals are catching on, they point to electoral victories by liberals such as AOC. But nothing really ever happens. No closer to the end of capitalism. At some point you gotta think that the standard tactics, and indeed strategy, are just a long-game played by the establishment.

My point is that there are real ways you can make change today, you could be living the rest of your life in an anarchist reality if you really wanted to. You could move to Mongolia and live as a nomad even. I think the truth is that you want the rest of us to change for you, so that you can enjoy all the trappings of modern life, the cities, the technology, etc. You could create a microcosm of the world you want to live in and live in it. &#x200B; How is your current tactic more effective? I'm sure within the echo chamber of anarchist media it seems like a big deal but world wide anarchism is barely a fringe element of society. In your average city in North America you're lucky if 300 people are willing to dawn ski masks and smash up cars. It's only when protests are happening that anarchists can utilize the crowds to incite huge riots but most of the people who join in have no interest in anarchism. I should say I can only speak for my own city in regards to the above statements. &#x200B; To be honest the poverty comment is me just regurgitating things I've heard and read from sources I tend to trust but I'm not willing to die on that hill without doing my own research. That said, look there are a lot of issues I have with capitalism. I think the idea that you are born into a world where every stitch of land is already owned is insane. I think land and resources should be equally divided among all human beings, living and forecast to come. There is more than enough land for everyone to build their own house and barely make a dent. I also think there should be some sort salary cap mechanism to prevent people from accumulating too much wealth. However we have to leave room, in the name of freedom, for the various levels of ambition that people possess. Some people are content with the bare necessities, while other people are big dreamers. Take my example of everyone being allowed land to build their own house. If one person is lazy and decides to settle for some rickety tent, while his neighbors passion is architecture and builds some super fancy designed house, I don't see what's wrong with that.

"If the main theme of the protest is economics, economic injustice/inequality, then it will eventually be a class protest, and a class protest brings class consciousness. This is not new in France, austerity protests have been going on for the past 8 years, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and elsewhere. Since extreme neo-liberal reforms took place on those countries earlier and 'movements' proved to be incapable of altering reform, it is now moving to countries of lesser budgetary urgency. The UK is next, Brexit or non-Brexit will be used as an alibi for reforms. And Germany is not going to stand as the last living social-democracy. It is a global front against the environment and humanity. It is brutal, its power is beyond local/national politics, it is mandated from private economic institutions. It is capital getting organized. Meanwhile traditional social resistance from movements and parties has proved to be totally and politically ineffective to stop any of this. There is no negotiation and anyone to negotiate with. Anything 'common' has to be privatized and moved to the hands of international capital. I mean 'everything', physical, natural, and more. Like information, knowledge, data, history, science, ..... the ocean, the beach, the river, the lake, the mountain, 'the land', the sidewalk and the street even, ... you have to pay to use and you have to pay those that purchased the right to manage it. It is not just about means of production anymore, it is about earth and every living thing on it, becomes just a commodity for international capital to own and to manage. The state is portrayed as an innocent reformer which can not do otherwise or the 'economy' will collapse. Even the US government is not portrayed as having options. It will too be 'forced' to reform (more than it already has), it is the most bankrupt of any state. All states are now 'bankrupt', and their debt is held by international financial institutions, which are defended by all states and all armies. &#x200B; Protests will intensify, brutality will intensify, nothing will change, not a single thing will be taken back from a right, center, or left administration.

Substantive positive change won't be achieved without violence or suffering. The question is how what is the minimum amount necessary for the maximum amount of Libertarian? What are the limits of human liberation? Etc. IMO Stalin and there USSR beaurocrats created much more suffering than was necessary for the amount of liberation they afforded the citizens of the USSR.

"As expected. And yes you can't, but I feel like most internet anarchs just hate cops for the meme. I know people from both 'sides' inside (or by now out of) the force (can you call it 'sides' if it's so assymetrical?) and precisely because of that I can't trust it at all.",t3_a7uvu8,Anarchism

"Marxists are not “totalitarian”. If you were referring to MLs I would however agree somewhat even if I wouldn’t use that word, as their party organisation moves power from the working class to the party officials.",t3_a76hdy,Anarchism
My point was that the admins don't care. They banned it because it's called r/antifa. And history shows us the admins think antifa and communism are teh evil. You really think the admins know the difference between real antifa and fake antifa? The whole sub was just a circlejerk for shitting on antifa. There was no violent content on it. It broke no rules. They banned it for being an antifa sub.,t3_a7i0i5,Anarchism

"I don't think you're understanding what 100% means. There's literally a gay person in this comment thread that says he doesn't give a fuck about the word 'faggot'. That's an instance that it's not offensive. So how can you say that something like 'faggot' is always bad no matter what if here we have a case where someone is not offended by it? I understand that when someone does say they have a problem with any one word, especially a slur like that, we should avoid saying it. Like, we're on the same page there. I just think that sometimes things are okay and not harmful, especially in private circles where these words are used in jest. &#x200B; If I were to call a friend 'retarded', and we had been doing this for years without any sort of damage in the privacy of our own homes, why is that wrong? I'm very open to the idea of it being wrong. I just haven't had anyone explain to me why it would be yet. ",t3_a8izvp,Anarchism
Bit of a stretch to call Joe Rogan 'a piece of shit'. He has some misguided views but he seems like a genuine person who is doing his best.,t3_a791fq,Anarchism
"Best post, completely agreed. More anarchists should educate themselves and read, because this anti-Stalin rhetoric moves so far beyond critique into the realm of Liberal propaganda it is frankly embarrassing to see Anarchists act this way. Reminds me of what Mark Fisher said about the bourgeois hangover of internet-dwelling 'neo-'anarchists. Seriously, comrades: do your homework. There is lots to criticize about Stalin without dipping your toes into reactionary claptrap. OP, causing reddit drama like this is frankly just embarrassing. ",t3_a7giuo,Anarchism
