"Don't around 30% of Hispanics vote Republican in most elections (presidential elections at least)? I think Republicans/Conservatives are naive if they think pandering to Hispanics is going to get them anywhere. This has been put on pause with Trump, but prior to Trump you had Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, supporting amnesty, opposing border security, etc. It was the consensus among establishment Republicans that we must try to attract Hispanics to the party. In the end though, I think its a fools errand. Ethnic groups vote in a tribal way (whites included) and it seems almost nothing you do changes this significantly. For example, Trump has been the most pro-Jewish pro-Israel president in modern history, yet 80+% of Jews will still vote democrat in 2020. He has actually, in many ways, been the most pro-black President ever in terms of doing things that specifically benefit the black community, however 85+% of blacks will still vote Democrat in 2020. Conversely, Trump hasn't pandered to Hispanics at all, and in fact supports anti-immigration policies that pundits believe cost Trump with Hispanics, yet he still got around the standard 30% of hispanics in 2016. Trump won in 2016 by doing what Ann Coulter has suggested for many years, which was drive up the white vote and appeal to white voters. ",t3_aa2ogh,TheNewRight

">I’ll start with ‘say, what’s in this drink?’ It is easy to read that as ‘did you put something in my drink’, but the line ‘say, what’s in this drink’ is actually a common tongue-in-cheek reference of the time period. This was written in 1948, as a party song that was song regularly by Lester and his wife, and eventually included in one of his broadway shows. ‘Say, what’s in this drink’ shows up in numerous movies, plays, and books of the time period — it’s code for, I want to do something society tells me I shouldn’t, but I might get away with behaving badly if I was drunk.’ This isn’t a message that is saying he’s getting her plowed to stay at his house, this is her trying to make sense of her own desires. This is from a feminist blog from 2010 defending the song. >This interpretation is backed up by the rest of the lyrics. If you pay attention to her litnany of reasons she has to leave, not one of them has anything to do with her not wanting to stay. Its her aunts and uncles at home. Her mother who might be worried. Her father is going to be mad. People might talk. This is a song about desire, about wanting to spend the night at time when good girls didn’t sleep over at their boyfriend’s house. When she leaves in the morning, she gets to use the excuse ‘I didn’t come home because the weather was so bad’. Everyone will know that she probably could have come home, but it doesn’t matter. She needs to save face. So ‘Baby, it’s cold outside’. >**It’s important that the song ends on the two voices singing the same line, because they’ve been trading back and forth for the rest of it. Is he asking her to stay? Yes, he is. He’s offering her reasons and excuses she can stay, because she wants to.** She needs a way out, because, let’s be honest, it’s been a very recent phenomena that women aren’t immediately assumed to be damaged goods just by spending the night at a male’s house — in 1948, yeah, people slept around, but it wasn’t accepted, and single, good girls who still live with their parents?

" We have had years of bullshit propaganda about ~~global warming~~ climate change. They told us that NYC and Miami would be underwater by 2015, that countries would sink that cities would not be livable. None of it happened. Because this is all based on models that you can put anything into you want. Want a model that says Miami will be underwater by 2015, just keep pushing the fucking up button until it gives you the answer you want. 'We’re nearly two years into the Trump era and holdovers from President Barack Obama’s administration are *still* spreading on executive agency websites alarmist climate propaganda as if it were factual and the official position of the administration' The report, titled *Executive Branch Websites Promoting Global Warming Alarmism and Propaganda*, audits the websites of NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institutes of Health, U.S. Global Change Research Program, and the Departments of Agriculture (DOA), Defense, and Energy (DOE). **The audit reveals federal agencies are continuing to push false claims about climate and environmental issues, including that humans are verifiably causing dangerous climate change.** **Not only are these agencies failing to accurately describe the active debate concerning the causes and consequences of climate change, they are making normative claims about the past that reflect progressive and liberal value judgments concerning America’s development, rather than objective scientific facts about various technological innovations and the contributions they have made toward extending human life and economic development.** To the extent NASA has a role at all in teaching children, it is supposed to be teaching children about space and the wonders of the technologies making space exploration and the expansion of knowledge about our universe possible. NASA should be encouraging young minds to reach for the stars, not to revert back to living in caves or mud huts and depending upon horses to get around. Rockets are not powered by moonbeams, solar panels, or wind turbines—they launch into space using carbon-based jet fuel. Further, the computers making space launches possible are powered by coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants—not solar or wind industrial facilities. NASA’s website is regularly and reliably powered by fossil-fuel generated electricity, and so are the computers, iPhones, and smart devices kids use to access its site. These are the very same fuels NASA’s website decries. On its website, NASA also continues to push the false assertion 97 percent of scientists agree humans are causing dangerous climate change. This claim is based on only a few studies, all of which have been thoroughly debunked. The research most often cited as backing this argument was conducted by Australian researcher John Cook and a team he worked with. After audits of Cook’s work found numerous errors, Cook himself admitted his team did not follow proper protocols in compiling the survey of the literature they conducted. Indeed, audits of Cook’s work found rather than 97 percent of the studies they analyzed indicating “climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities,” Cook’s research actually found just 32.6 percent of the papers his group reviewed explicitly linked global warming to human activity. Approximately 66 percent of academic papers reviewed took no stance on the issue. Many of the scientists who Cook’s team claimed supported the view humans were behind the recent modest warming subsequently explicitly stated that is not what their research found. Among the most egregious falsehoods spread by holdovers from the Obama administration comes in a portion of DOA’s website discussing the threats human-caused climate change supposedly poses to agriculture. DOA writes, “Climate change is likely to diminish continued progress on global food security through production disruptions that lead to local availability limitations and price increases, interrupted transport conduits, and diminished food safety, among other causes.” **The truth, however, is the use of fossil fuels in agriculture and the recent increase in carbon-dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels has contributed to substantial** ***increases*** **in crop yields and a measurable greening of the earth. Crop yields—including, but not limited to, basic cereal grains—continue to set records year over year, and they have been helped, not harmed by, increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and modestly warmer nighttime temperatures, which have resulted in fewer frosty nights and longer growing seasons. In fact, thousands of controlled experiments show plants consistently mature faster, produce greater yields, and use water more efficiently under conditions of higher carbon dioxide than we are experiencing at present or are likely to experience at any time in the future.** The examples above are just a few of the false or misleading claims deep-state operatives burrowed into the bowels of executive agencies continue to promote on government websites. Not only are they deceptive, they undermine the climate realism promoted by President Donald Trump and his leadership team in the White House. Please educate yourself about the climate alarmism in the executive branch by reading the full report, and then work to encourage the administration to either pull these websites down or, at the very least, have them rewritten to accurately portray the state of the climate change debate and the relative benefits and costs of fossil fuels.",t3_aaphkv,TheNewRight

"1. No one in there right mind 'claims' that any race is evil and racist. Normal people believe that it is natural human tendency to have **slight** prejudice against other races, not be racist. 2. No one thinks that everyone is exactly exactly equal, but that doesn't mean their lives don't hold equal value. 3. There is actual evidence and proof that policemen have the highest amount of people with antisocial personality disorder. Even with that fact, it is still widely believed that almost all policemen have good intentions, and that the problem isn't the officers, but the supervision of all officers. 4. I don't know your race, but how I understand this, you seem to be a racist by saying minorities actually aren't just as smart. But assuming that's not what you meant, then i don't know what you meant. 5. There's a difference between harmful stereotypes and humorous stereotypes. Everyone knows that no one legitimately believes gingers have no souls, and while this is a hurtful thing to say to someone, it's a completely different topic. An example of a hurtful stereotype would be all right winged people are racist, because people actually think that even though only few right winged people are, just like any other group of people 6. No sane person wants to 'ban happy meals' or 'legalize all drugs' 7. I agree. 8. No rational person thinks the teabaggers are terrorists 9. I don't see the correlation, but half of the stuff in this sub (including this post) is an ad hominem. 10. No rational person thinks capitalism is evil, some just think it can be improved 11. People will have different beliefs about wars, but isn't the Libya war a civil war? 12. All rational people understand that pretty every major news outlet is biased 13. Muslim women in America have just as much freedom as any other other American, and they've used that freedom to join a religion that ranks them less than men. Is that a great thing? No. But the fact that they can choose to or not to do that is a very good thing. 14. Most people who hate Obama aren't racist and black republicans aren't stupid. Only assholes think that. 15. Liberals think big corporations are 'The Man', not the government. 16. Liberals don't disrespect respectful Christians. However, some Christians will use the bible as an excuse to infringe on others rights. What makes this different from other religions is Muslims won't try to take make laws taking away peoples rights, but some Christians will. (For example, Gay Marriage.) 17. I've never heard any of those words used seriously except trash which has nothing to do with race. 18. Liberals believe flat tax isn't fair 19. People who believe abortion is ok don't think of unborn, unconscious fetus' as people. 20. Liberals accept that global warming is a thing and want cheaper **clean** energy, not just energy 21.

Much like the cuckold doesn't view his wife fucking other men as cheating, the liberal doesn't see the end of American culture as wrong or bad ('don't see it as a bastardization') The analogy initially arose because of the aptness of comparing a the mindsets of self-hating white liberals to the self hating cuckold, both of which enjoy watching and actively seek their own replacement.

Yes we Americans do have a strength from our diversity, but Tucker IMO was also correct in stating that not able to communicate with your neighbor and not sharing common values is not the kind of diversity that makes our Nation great and/or strong. Diversity in of itself is neither a good thing or a bad thing, think of it like water. We need water to continue to live, but too much water can kill us (**drown** if you are wondering). Not saying too much diversity will kill us, only stating that diversity is an aspect that can contribute to an end result, either positively or negatively. Diversity is not limited to race, culture, or only to human being in general. &#x200B; Diverse: showing a great deal of variety. &#x200B; So a diverse selection of thought would be good for more perspectives, yet a diverse selection of instruments in which I beat you with, would not be.",t3_a2vu47,TheNewRight

"Awesome painting. Very cool style. I love the style and way you captured not just the identified of the subjects but you painted a lot of intention into their expressions. I may be wrong, but it appears that trump is painted with 'rough strokes' and Kanye with 'soft rounded strokes' - really neat. &#x200B; Critique: Art can be personal, so neither right or wrong, these are my impressions. I can't help but wonder what you were trying to achieve. It puts me off that Kanye is 'serving' trump by lighting his cigarillo(?). I don't think Kanye carries water for anyone, he's a wild character and will likely be on different sides over time. The 'New slaves' over his shoulder is hard to miss, it's his song, but it seems to label him. Trump does not smoke or drink, so anytime I see art where he is doing either, I think, 'oh, this is someone with TDS trying to attack Trump but it's all projection because they don't even know Trump doesn't have those particular bad habits. I bet the artist smokes and so they put it in the image.' More personal interpretation; I don't believe in magical third eye vision, so I see Kanye as having his real eyes closed (ticked) and his magical third eye open (seeing false reality) and thus he is not aware that Trump is not a 'good person'. Trump in this image has no humor, no twinkle in his eye, and he appears to be purely focussed on his superiority over the viewer, and, perhaps, what he can get from me (the viewer). I respect that skill that went into the image, but I don't see either of these men he way you do. &#x200B; NOTE: I have now looked at your history a little, and it appears that you intend the third eye as a positive. I respect that entirely, no offense meant by my interpretation above. Your Ray Charles is especially cool. I also compliment you on posting the image in different places, You should post in in  and see the reaction, probably will get a whole investing range. I see you answered a question about the image thus: 'Trying to make sense of such a baffling relationship. You can view their friendship from many different angles all with opposing beliefs and conclusions you seek. I believe there’s a lot more than what’s on the surface in their strange relationship, there’s some affinity there but also ulterior motives.' Of course you are right, all powerful people get that way by always having ulterior motives. The biggest mistake we can make is thinking that anyone with real power got that power accidentally, or by being the nicest person in the room. Reality doesn't work that way. I think you can see it in Trump and Kanye, there is a really affection there, but I think they both sense that the other is an 'operator'. And both have a history of unpredictability. It makes them an interesting pair. Thanks for sharing. Your art gave me the gift of firing up the gray matter and making me think.",t3_aa0jg1,TheNewRight

"Is this post appropriate for /r/TheNewRight? Of course not. It's a joke. This post is a story from the liberal USA Today, claiming that conservatives are driven by conspiracy theories. Look, I can find (cherry-pick) some extreme right crazy stuff, so therefore all conservatives who are concerned about the caravan and illegal immigration are out of their mind! If you actually are a conservative (OP isn't), you know that Reddit is overwhelmingly liberal... both the company, and the users of the site. Social Media sites have a choice to make. Either they take up the leftist cause, and discriminate against conservatives and conservative viewpoints, or they actively work to insure both sides can be heard from. Reddit suffers from the tyranny of the majority (of left-leaning Redditors). Go to /r/politics, and try to find a conservative story that isn't downvoted into oblivion. Most non-political subs ( /r/videos, /r/science, /r/pics, etc.) are also overwhelmed with leftist political posts and comments. This sub is supposed to be the home of the new right movement, yet the mods are AWOL, and so like the rest of Reddit, it's flooded with left-leaning posts and comments. This is what Antifa left wants. They don't want free speech, they only want left speech. Everything else is deemed hate speech, or racist, or misogynist, or some other intersectional label by the judge and jury of all things right and wrong... the tolerant left.

"Ok I'll bite... What about heterosexual couples who can't produce kids? I am a fully functioning member of society, I am well educated, well employed, I pay all my bills and except for student loans and my mortgage I'm not really in very much debt, I donate to charity because I want to, and I do my best to be a good person every day. I can't have children though. Would I be denied the choice to marry someone? I don't think the topic is about heterosexual couples and nothing I said has anything to do with it. I am confused why you brought this up? It is about condoning unions legally that do not serve positive interests of the society itself. More specifically about a mico minority that literally holds the majority not only in contempt but hostage to its demands. The good of the whole has to be balanced against the good of the minority and judgement has to fall to the majority without emotional blackmail as we have been held for too long. Getting married isn't about having kids, it is about a tax relationship between you, your spouse, and the government. Plenty of people have kids without getting married. That's a narrow view that ignores the positive effects on children, the whole as it is the basic unit of society that the left attacks mercilessly, and about independence from the state. They have broken down relations between the sexes and the family to make people dependent on the state and weaken the basic block of society. It much much more than about money, it's about survival of society itself. That's why it doesn't matter... Also...The reason why young people aren't having kids is that they can't afford to. Health Care, student loans, and depressed wages for the bottom half of the financial scale is why they don't have kids. They can't afford to because their own beloved left made it that way. Just in my own fathers time one working person could support an entire family and house on a blue collar job. Blue collar jobs were respected then as well. Very respected. I wish I could find a seminar I watched by a lady doctor I saw recently she did a lifelong study on just this and the results are amazing and I can't find the damned thing. I'll save this thread and if I see it again pm you with it. Basically in the seminar she said the left supported womens lib which made economics shift to two people necessary to hold down a home, endless waves of immigration (for corporations and votes) that made labor ever less valuable as time went on due to increased competition, the idea that every man is a valuable independent unit of society, that is unique to any other nation was eroded. By the left. All the left is... is destruction toward ill defined goals that are presented as virtue but are actually evil. I wouldn't go so far as to say we should legislate a change to that (look where I'm posting...and I'm not a troll) but that is part of the fallout. I think the debate wouldn't even be happening if the left did not undermine religion since it's very beginning resulting in two camps that cannot even talk with one another anymore because they do not agree on the fundamental arbiter ruleset. One plays by ever shifting emotional appeal perceptions, myopic and immediate in nature, and the other by hard set written ones. Henry Ford had the smart philosophy, pay well, retain the best talent, and it will improve profits (through less turnover and by enabling you to pack the best workers). It will also create a group of more affluent employees who but stuff and drive the economy. This doesn't need government policy, this needs smart business leadership, because the government policy will be a shit show. I agree and it makes me so sad how corporate culture is so cruel to the worker today, I believe it is because corporate culture is leftist. Leftists also do not recognize a soul in people. This is also why calling conservatives 'nazis' is literally the very worst thing the left can do, sure immediately it probably feels great and makes the leftist feel 'morally superior' but not only is it false, because the right recognizes a soul in all people, but it's hypocrisy and malice does nothing but steele the right every time it is said. Look how galvanized the right is and continues to be here and world wide. The more it is said the more right the entire world moves. So in a way I hope it doesn't stop! As awful as it is to endure. Leftists (liberalism) have literally come to the end of it's ideology, and it is in it's necrotic phase. It began as a rebellion against a church that was in it's own necrotic phase and cruel. That church as since reformed, officially apologized to the world and learned from it's mistakes. Today the left has literally made a religion out of leftism, which is in all practical objective purposes quite satanic in nature. Look how leftists act today there is literally no objective difference between a leftist today and an inquisitor then. 'I'm better than you, I'm more moral than you, you are a (insert insult here), you are stupid, you are the bad one'... The only difference is the left has taken on a much more Nazi platform than recessive church then; Leftists target religion and race. And project on them what leftists actually are. (Russia! while the Clintons and the left were in bed with them, Nazi! while targeting white people and Christians)  Then telling them to give up their guns lol. Like that will ever happen before a full scale revolution! People who know they are targeted for genocide do not give up their means of self defense! As far as single payer not being run by the government, it had to be. It's like road maintenance. There isn't a financial incentive for it not to be, so it will never happen. They are the only 'organization' that has the ability to structure something like that in a financially efficient way. You know, there wasn't a problem with health care just 50 years ago.

"They broke down society into national identities rather than class based ones. But they were definitely playing the game by the same rules as the commies. The 20th century shows us that Fascism can be a result of bulwarking against communist creep. Look at Islamic extremism in the -stans south of Russia. Same phenomenon as Nazi Germany. The US had a little hand in kicking those off to seal communism in though. It worked too well it seems. Communism always seems to precede fascism though. Any 'communist' saying they're fighting fascism is attempting to create flagrant opposition where there is none, to justify their existence, communists often have little meaning in their life and existence. And it is an inevitable self fulfilling prophesy. Actually fighting fascism, on behalf of or at the behest of communist states, well, that just creates more useful idiots I believe.",t3_a7blx7,TheNewRight

I would say the same about myself except that I am not probably as socially liberal and nowhere near progressive on anything. Progressive is communist and I am not a collectivist, that has lead to more death than anything human history. I look at healthcare... It's literally cheaper to do single payer... Why the fuck aren't we doing it? It would give better care for fewer dollars. I said the same thing during the Obamacare debates. The fact is the left is corporate, more so than republicans ever were (except for the neocons which are now rejected albeit took long enough to accomplish it). The first neocon/neoliberal shill is laying in a box and good riddance. We are returning to our foundations, our traditions and our constitution finally and to be a leftist is frankly, if you re paying attention to the pendulum moving right every day probably not a great idea. It's *well past time* to really self reflect and critically think all of these communist (progressive) ideas critically. Same with the whole civil rights stuff... Why would one person be denied the right to be just as miserable as anyone else... Let someone marry anyone he or she wants to. Then we aren't paying tax dollars for this crap to be fought about in the courts. Because unions between same sexes do not produce a healthy fruitful society. You get your feel good and now we literally have total anarchy and a negative birth rate. Do you not see that side of the equation? You can't cater to a literal micro minority holding the good of the society itself and the majority hostage to it! I feel similarly about gun rights. If a person can prove he or she isn't a danger to themselves or others, who cares what kinds of guns they buy. They are law abiding Americans why penalize them? With Antifa literally roaming the streets calling *anyone* that opposes communism worthy of violence and exacting it on them can you really say that with a straight face? Your altruism or signalling thereof means literally nothing to me when me and mine are threatened. With the lefts history of genocide and tyrrany I can't trust the motives. Defending ones self is *natural law*. One regrettable, granted, that we all eventually run the risk of, but still a natural right. And a legal one that 'shall not be infringed'.

A person can still be saved if they have committed homosexual acts... They dont necessarily become a reprobate. The condemnation comes when they reject God and accept the sin as an identity. It is the clearest evidence of a reprobate mind. Not all reprobates are homosexuals but all self proclaimed 'Gays' are reprobates. Rommans 1:27-28 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 'God gives them over' This means redemption is lost. They will not answer the calling from Jesus because he isnt knocking on the door any longer. As far as hate goes. Just search abhor in any study bible platform.

"Thankyou, this emphasizes my point. This speaks nothing of percentages. By this reasoning, the government could tax 95% of your income and provide you housing and it would be just. But by this same reasoning though we should not be paying property tax on our home or yard which if garden for food. We should also not be paying taxes on my heating, plumbing, groceries, or any clothing used to keep warm and/or block out the sun's harmful UV rays. We should also not be taxing anything used in self defense such as guns, ammunition, or other weapons. Indeed, anything used for self conservation and propagation of the species - that includes drugs, medication, or any medical treatments that are deemed necessary. Who determines what is necessary and what is not? What if I am unable to farm, so the only way I can get food for myself and family is to work a job that is not nearby, therefore I need a vehicle of some sort. Should I be exempt from tax on that then? It's a great line and it puts an emphasis on how **only sales tax and capital gains tax** is justified.

Indeed large pediatric societies view this type of forceful gender manipulation as child abuse.

In fact, transgenders have a 4x suicide rate and it doesn’t change even when “transitioning”. A lot of studies also show up to 94% of children with gender dysphoria “grow out of it”. Other studies show trans clusters where multiple kids dabble with being trans after a friend decides to.

"A lot of people follow blindly, unfortunately. It creates a lot of tension and disagreement. Personally, I think there’s always a time for tax cuts. Governments around the world spend money on a very big variety of things, but they always threated with cuts in education, health, social security etc.. instead of cutting things that don’t really matter. E.g corrupt countries in Africa gets a lot of money annually, and it’s only used for more corruption. I totally agree that the national debt should be paid off though. The government should make several cuts in unneccessary spending and pay of the debt along with some tax cuts. And the taxes should not be raised. ",t3_a6evpb,TheNewRight

Do you not see that side of the equation? You can't cater to a literal micro minority holding the good of the society itself and the majority hostage to it! Ok I'll bite... What about heterosexual couples who can't produce kids? I am a fully functioning member of society, I am well educated, well employed, I pay all my bills and except for student loans and my mortgage I'm not really in very much debt, I donate to charity because I want to, and I do my best to be a good person every day. I can't have children though. Would I be denied the choice to marry someone? Getting married isn't about having kids, it is about a tax relationship between you, your spouse, and the government. Plenty of people have kids without getting married. That's why it doesn't matter... Also...The reason why young people aren't having kids is that they can't afford to. Health Care, student loans, and depressed wages for the bottom half of the financial scale is why they don't have kids. I wouldn't go so far as to say we should legislate a change to that (look where I'm posting...and I'm not a troll) but that is part of the fallout. Henry Ford had the smart philosophy, pay well, retain the best talent, and it will improve profits (through less turnover and by enabling you to pack the best workers). It will also create a group of more affluent employees who but stuff and drive the economy. This doesn't need government policy, this needs smart business leadership, because the government policy will be a shit show. As far as single payer not being run by the government, it had to be.

I bet I've struggled a thousand times more than you. >Guys kids get sick, he loses it all, needs a handout and suddenly he's not worthy of a vote? It's not about worthiness, you troll. If he needs charity from other people, he should not be deciding how much charity he gets. No matter how tragic the situation, if you allow that you will generate more tragedy than you solve. Further, if we did deny the vote to people living off the government, they could instead take private charity and still vote. There are billions of dollars of medical charity given to children hospitals in this country, and if medicare/medicaid didn't exist there'd be many many billions more. >You have thought NONE of this through. Go look in a mirror man. >If you want to talk about ways to weed out the fraud, I am all ears No, you're not, because I've suggested the ultimate solution and you reject it with intellectually dishonest strawman arguments. >don't sit here and try and convince me that people with issues in their life deserve less. I didn't say that, troll. I said they don't deserve a say in how much they receive from other people against those other people's will.

Why do you even care about this point except as an attempt to demonize the community as mentally Iill? You want to wield the title of mentally ill ad a weapon to turn transgender into pariahs. Not sure why this is necessary unless your entire motivating factor is predetermined hate. >Wait so, stigma for mental illness is bad, but we don’t want to call people with gender dysphoria mentally ill because that would be bad too?? Who said this? You made this up. Strawmen after strawmen to support your hatred. >Way to fight the stigma there liberals! So virtuous! So genuine! So sincere and caring for ALL people! Again not everyone in the World Health Organization is a liberal. YOU'VE assumed that because their stance is different than yours.

Different conditions have different treatments. >Nobody is scared, we are annoyed that all of sudden you want to placate the mentally ill. Not just in their genital mutilation: Bathrooms, sports, workplaces, military, everything. Placate. I dont think you even know what word means. They arent sympathy seekers. They are people born feeling like they belong in a different body and the best treatment by the professionals who spend their entire lives studying this issue is to transition. But of course you know better because you spent an hour every day watching Fox News and all the hand wringing about how men that look like ladies are scary. >I bet you’re a HUGE Falon Fox fan huh? Love watching that grown man just pummel on those ladies right? Equality! Tolerance! This is really the issue that keeps you up at a night? Reclassify all MMA. Who gives a rat's ass about this. Things change society adapts, fighting brackets will get redefined. Somehow I think we'll survive this horrible atrocity to the fighting. This is a great example of the hand wringing, pearl clutching nonsense deployed by Fox News and the right. >Way to muddy the waters in things that were perfectly clear before we had to accommodate a mental illness that suddenly throws biology out of the window in the name of identity politics. So things are different now and you don't like that. Grow the fuck up. The world changes and we need to grow and be better people. That's a good rhing6. >What does the T in LGBQT stand for again? And why are we grouping mentally ill people together with people who are attracted to the same sex I wonder? Hmmmm. You’re pretty clueless huh? What? Because a group takes another sub group in and considers them allies that means what exactly? You do realize your side were calling gays mentally ill until 4 years ago. I dont even know what this means or what point you are making here. It's completely nonsensical. >Gay rights and women’s rights aren’t a mental health issue. Weird that you’re grouping all of these people together though. They sure were. Gayness was treated as a mental illness. Now go look up hysteria and see what that means and how women were locked in institutions for it.

"'Snuff film'? We are describing a hate crime murder here, not some 'lone wolf' killing. It's interesting you used the term 'snuff'. That's such a specific word. Almost as if someone sexually gets off to seeing death on film. Murders and hate crimes happen all the time, but snuff is specific. That's : >British link to 'snuff' videos Jason Burke in London, Amelia Gentleman in Moscow, Philip Willan in Rome Sat 30 Sep 2000 20.19 EDT Shares 2157 >Britain is a key link in the biggest ever international investigation into the production and supply of paedophile 'snuff' movies - in which children are murdered on film - an Observer investigation can reveal. The key suspect in the inquiry, a Russian who was arrested last week in Moscow for distribution of thousands of sadistic child porn videos and pictures, was traced following the seizure of his products from British paedophiles. Dmitri Vladimirovich Kuznetsov, a 30-year-old former car mechanic in Moscow, was identified after British Customs and police traced the origin of violent child porn videos found in the UK back to Russia. >Last week Italian police seized 3,000 of Kuznetsov's videos on their way to clients in Italy, sparking an international hunt for paedophiles who have bought his products. The Italian investigators say the material includes footage of children dying during abuse. Prosecutors in Naples are considering charging those who have bought the videos with complicity in murder. They say some may have specifically requested films of killings. British authorities yesterday confirmed that scores of Kuznetsov's videos, produced in his small flat in Moscow's rundown Vykhino district, have been found in the UK. They are concerned that 'snuff' movies in which children are killed may have also been imported. Around a dozen British men have already been arrested and charged with offences alleged to be connected to the Russian tapes. A second Russian child porn ring, which allegedly had a British distributor, was broken up earlier this year. The investigation into the importing of violent Russian child porn which led to the identification and subsequent imprisonment of Kuznetsov started about 15 months ago after Customs seized material coming into the country. Since then there have been dozens of other finds. 'We have seen some very, very nasty stuff involving sadistic abuse of very young children, but actual deaths on film takes it a whole step further. That is very worrying,' said one senior customs officer this weekend. British paedophiles were paying between £50 and £100 for Kuznetsov's tapes, the officer said. Further fees were paid for access to a website that features pictures of extremely violent abuse. Though two men arrested with Kuznetsov have also been imprisoned by Moscow authorities, only one of the three remains behind bars. Dmitri Ivanov was sentenced to 11 years for actually participating in the abuse that was being filmed. The others were released under an amnesty aimed at clearing Russia's overcrowded prisons. When officers from the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department raided Kuznetsov's flat they found two boys in a makeshift studio. They seized a huge quantity of films and other pornographic material as well as lists of clients in Italy, Germany, America and Britain. Last week Italian detectives moved in, following months of inquiries, and arrested eight people. The police searched more than 600 homes and say they now have evidence against about 500 people. Among the suspects were businessmen, public employees and a university student. Several of them were married, with children of their own. Hundreds of people are also under investigation in Germany. The Russian videos, which had been ordered over the internet, were intercepted when they came into Italy by post, repackaged and then delivered by undercover police officers. They cost between £300 and £4,000, depending on what type of film was ordered. Covert film of young children naked or undressing was known as a 'SNIPE' video. The most appalling category was code-named 'Necros Pedo' in which children were raped and tortured until they died. Police in Russia and the UK believe that Kuznetsov and his associates have been in business for more than two years in which time they are believed to have recruited around 100 boys - aged between nine and 15 - to be filmed. 'Most of the children were rounded up from railway stations. A lot of them came from the suburbs, or surrounding regions and were from deprived, problem families,' said Kiril Mazurin, a police spokesman. 'Usually when children like this arrive in the capital, they've got no idea where to go and hang around in the station. It's very easy to entice this kind of teenager - with a promise of a warm bed or a trip to the cinema.' Many were lured away from orphanages. 'Children are not locked in,' said Mazurin. 'Anyone can come along and promise them a meal at McDonalds. It doesn't take any more than that.' Some children were paid a commission to find other boys willing to be filmed, according to reports in the Russian press, for a fee of between 100 and 300 roubles (£2.50 - £7). Kuznetsov had given up his job in 1998 to devote himself to the lucrative pornography industry. A self-taught computer expert, he was in the process of upgrading his equipment to allow him to e-mail videos directly to clients when police raided him. Many customers repeatedly ordered videos from him. The Naples newspaper Il Mattino published a transcript of an alleged email exchange between a prospective client and the Russian vendors. 'Promise me you're not ripping me off,' says the Italian. 'Relax, I can assure you this one really dies,' the Russian responds. 'The last time I paid and I didn't get what I wanted.' 'What do you want?' 'To see them die.'",t3_aammyy,TheNewRight

I'm going to need to hunt down the article, as the summary lacks any coherent... anything. However, I am reminded of the way Feinmann has talked about the nature of theories and data and contends people, including experts, have a tendency to conflate descriptions and information with the thing one is trying to unserstand. It creates a feedback loop of bias against what we think we know. For example, light isn't the abstract concept 'a wave' or the abstract concept 'a particle', light is light. Same way when someone disagrees with us about X there is an assumption that the other person is looking at the issue exactly the same way but comes to some perfectly opposite conclusion. It's absurd, but easy to do. And funny enough we can do the same thing with people that agree with us. So I can imagine maybe something in that realm.

"\-First off these numbers don't just include illegal immigrants. It also includes long-term temporary visitors (e.g. guestworkers and foreign students) and permanent residents who have not naturalized (green card holders). So at the outset you're boosting the numbers. It's not just illegals. \-Most of what's counted as welfare is being received by 63% of households. That's 6 in 10 you fucking idiots.-It's not illegals getting that welfare. It's their legal children qualifying for food stamps and medicaid. \-Food stamps, which 45% of non-citizen households are receiving, are deficit neutral. Kids getting food stamps doesn't cost you racist paranoid idiots anything. \-38% of native children are receiving welfare. And almost all the benefits illegals can get are through their children. 6 in 10 vs 4 in 10. The disparity isn't that much. And that's only when you slimeballs count green card holders to make the numbers of illegals on welfare seem higher than they really are. \-Only 6% of non-citizen households are receiving cash payments as welfare if you don't count EITC (which is a means tested program for ppl with jobs) compared to 8% of native households. \-It's obvious this anti-immigrant crusade is racially motivated since you're not only trying to get rid of all undocumented ppl, but you're also trying to take away green card status and things like DACA away to give more targets for ERO ICE to go after. It's just about purging as many brown ppl from the US as possible. \-They contribute a net surplus to the economy after welfare program payments are accounted for. So basically a bunch of tax payers have their kids getting medicaid at twice the rate as native households, which they probably wouldn't be trying to get if they had labor law protections and didn't get paid below minimum wage. Undocumented immigrants contribute a net plus to the economy, you idiots will hurt the economy by trying to purge as many brown ppl as possible, and your racial purge doesn't make any economic sense. &#x200B;",t3_a5353g,TheNewRight

"My reply to you isn’t to justify my belief and value system but perhaps shed some light on the fact that people can have different views than yourself. Additionally, for what it’s worth, I may disagree with much of the talking points that real liberals have, but I at least consider that other minds than mine may have a perspective worth considering. You, however, don’t seek understanding. You’ve labeled me in your mind. Yet it is i and my fellow colleagues on the right that you have labeled as alt right that really have a problem, right? This is how I see it. All racism is bad. As such, reverse racism wherein white people demonstrate hate for white people, or perpetuate racism towards white is bad. Furthermore, perpetuating the notion that white people and western civilization are the cause of evil is also wrong. I enjoy the luxuries provided to me by technology, the majority of which have been created by who? White men. This woman is complaining about turkey and white people. She is so privileged and insane, that she has the audacity to bitch about how turkey is dry. The echo chamber that is social media rewards her for her leftist idiocy because hey, fuck whitey, amiright? What is a hard reset? The earth and nature in general has a way of always finding out how to return to equilibrium. Considering this fact, society, too, will find a way to find balance again. Society in America has become so divided because there is one group that loves America, is nationalistic, encourages freedom of thought, and desires to see their country stay at the top of the hill. The other group hates America, wants anyone and everyone to be able to come here, wants to punish the white man as a form of retribution, purports Marxism, and desires to essentially level the playing field globally. Do I own a gun? Sure. I hunt, and I use it to protect myself because in this crazy world, all it takes is one insane person to take away your loved ones or your life, and it is my god given right to be able to protect these things. With gun ownership, and from hunting and fishing, I understand the sanctity of life. Hence, I would never harm other people. See that is the difference between the left and the right. Most people on the left are so removed from actually doing the things required to eat a steak that their echo chambers can facilitate such insane comments as this woman’s comments about turkey. Likewise, your comments about me and people here. Ultimately, there exists an ideological war between my side and your side. Regardless of who wins, although I believe my side will win as the world continues rejecting globalism, my side, the silent majority, will not go down without a fight. This is because when we talk about being an American, it means everything to us. And even if you can’t understand that, at least open your narrow view to consider it.",t3_a8behi,TheNewRight

"This (fifth largest econ in world) could be taken a lot of ways. For example, CA is the fifth largest econ / one of world's largest tax bases, so why not tax it to death. But on the flip side, then the people you tax leave. Which is also happening in CA. And then there are the Constitutional challenges, premised upon the First Amendment, that a tax specifically targeting cell phone text service users is likely to create. The ability to tax the services is not what is in question, but rather the specific proposal's constitutionality, which is already in serious doubt. Then there is the fact that no matter how much they tax, they won't be able to make up for the costs of (year after year) fire prevention, suppression, and post-fire claims. I recently asked a group of economics professionals (some of who were budget analysts, one was working in the State budget office, some of them were working with insurance and claims) what was the total cost for each year to California for 2016 and 2017 for fire prevention, suppression, and post-fire claims, and how did those numbers compare to what we know about 2018 numbers based on fire costs and claims submitted so far for 2018? I was expecting at least an educated guess, but all I got in response was crickets from the 'educated' group. Note that for 2017 alone, the estimated economic cost of California wildfires, including fire suppression, insurance, direct and indirect economic losses, and recovery expenditures is estimated at about $180 billion (2017 USD). That number may be lowball, though. The California debt as of Jan 2017 was about 1.3 trillion with a T dollars. The personal income tax revenue was 83 billion in 2016-2017. In other words: Fire related costs are outpacing what the State brings in. That is why the econ people had crickets when I asked the question. They know the doom the State is facing. Or should.

"Oh so anyone who knows what a fascist is is insane... ok. You got a great argument there. And in reality there are already dozens of restrictions on our right to bear arms, some save lives and make police work easier and some don't. Modifying our laws as times and technology change is a good thing that was baked into the constitution. And I am not clicking on those links I have never heard of any of those web sites. But I believe in the 1st and 2nd amendment, for example, there are restrictions to the 1st that are reasonable just like there are restrictions to the 2nd that are reasonable. And just so you know trying to shut up your opposition with ad hom attacks and trying to belittle them into obscurity is a characteristic of fascism. Plus there is an argument that ignoring the majority of people that are for reasonable and effective restrictions because the people in the center of power refuse to listen is also a characteristic of fascism. Just look at the data that shows congress doesn't do what their constituents want:  'Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.' But hey even trump banned bump stocks to try to appease outrage about the vegas shooting. Will it have as much effect as funding background checks, or somehow figuring out a way to help keep kids safe in school that aren't just placebo? And 'abolish our freedoms ad the US CONSTITUION' ( my bold enphasis ) is hyperbole and makes your argument weaker.

"The meme “no one reads the article, just the headline”, for me its mostly true because ads completely break the browsing experience on mobile. Most articles never stop loading the damn page. This morning I was just trying to read about driver updates for GPUs, I open the page watch it load to 70 percent and then stop. I set the phone down, made a cup of coffee and came back to the damn thing still loading. Im at home, on 5g wifi, 120 mbps... the page is waiting for me to scroll down to load the ad. Its infuriating to watch the article skip up and down, “X’s” popping up and closing them before the image can even load. This has to be a big reason people dont read shit online and forced many people to adopt “apps”. Traditional web browsing is unbearable on mobile without ad blockers. At least I can come to reddit and get a TLDR or copy pasta in the comments and actually get the info/propaganda. Reddit is still great for super niche topics.

"I respectfully disagree. Right wingers are never going to win over anywhere near enough blacks and hispanics to make it worth focusing on, and even if they do, they'll lose white support in the process and it'll end up being a net loss. How do Republicans try and win over hispanic/black voters? In the past its been dumb things like attempting to give speeches in Spanish, moving to the left on immigration, making dumb, ineffective arguments about how 'Oh actually didn't you know that the Democratic party was the party of the KKK? Hurr durrrr' . Has this produced any result? No. Republicans still get 25-30% of the Hispanic vote and 10% of the black vote - just like they always have. As Ann Coulter has pointed out, if Mitt Romney had won 70% of the Hispanic vote in 2012 he STILL would have lost to Obama. Had he won just 4% more of the white vote, he would have beaten Obama. Why are we bending over backwards to pick up a majority of the Hispanic vote when, even if we got it, we would STILL lose elections without strong white base support? It is only right wingers that try to do this shit. You don't hear liberals/Democrats on TV talking about how they should be trying to appeal to Evangelicals in order to get a bigger piece of the Evangelical vote. Or how they wish they could get a bigger piece of the white vote. No, they understand that their base is blacks, hispanics, educated white women, Muslims, immigrants, etc and they aim to drive up the vote in those categories. It is not coincidence that they label EVERY Republican presidential candidate a 'racist' and a 'sexist' REGARDLESS of who it is. These are trigger words to energize the base I described previously. The entire reason they support open borders/unlimited immigration is because they understand that 80% of legal immigrants will vote Democrat. They understand that even if illegals cant vote, their children they have here will be able to vote and they will also vote Democrat. They're, essentially, importing millions and millions of new voters. So, in my mind its either accept that demographics matter, and do things to combat the demographic trends + drive up the white vote. OR dont do that, and accept that the right wing is dead, and accept that you are going to have to move left in the future when there are no longer enough whites to get true right wingers elected on a national level anymore. We can see a microcosm of this in California. California is a state that went for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. In fact California went Republican in EVERY Presidential election from 1952 up to and including 1988 (with the exception of 1964 when they went for LBJ). It has never gone red since then, and likely won't for the foreseeable future. Why? Demographics. Massive illegal immigration, massive legal immigration.

Teachers: they held the doors open and made sure the kids got to the taxis full of pakistani pedophiles. teacher covered up when the kids came back 2 hours later, completely gang-raped, every day. **WHITE TEACHERS** would call 9 year old girls sluts and evil, saying they were bad, because the 9 year olds wanted it to stop, the teachers, **white female teachers, fearing they would get in trouble with the pakistani gangs... told 9 year old girls that they deserved it.** This is the left Same, social workers told the kids they were bad, they deserved it.

">No I blame racist liberals bringing them in to a degree it decreases my wages for over 30 years now Liberals not wanting to take away the same rights white ppl have to immigrate to the west isn't racist. Actually the opposite. This is an issue of labor supply vs labor demand but you ppl put so much emphasis on racial backgrounds, iq inferiority and not fitting into western culture, despite how obviously western and christian south americans are. Hence why it's easy to deduce your hatred towards brown migrants is racially motivated. Plus they're not the ones responsible for wages going down. They do jobs most native born US workers don't do so they're not competing for the same job market and aren't being used to bid down wages for jobs they're not competing for. You republicans and your free market pro-deregulation policies caused the decline of wages. You ppl destroyed unions so workers don't have leverage to get better wages and benefits. You ppl made it legal to engage in stock buybacks so higher stock prices would always be in direct conflict with workers getting higher wages since it would bring down stock prices since they're competing for a limited pool of money against the shareholders that own virtually all of the stock options. You republicans fucked over US workers. Not immigrants. You're either dumb or have racist priorities that make you shift the blame away from the obvious culprit to the powerless. >decreases my safety because democrats incite them racially against me as a white person Migrants have some of the lowest crime rates in the US. You are schizo af. Then again rightwingers have larger amygdalae that cause them to be more susceptible to being motivated by irrational fear. >the same democrats have voted in laws that DIRECTLY elevate them above me for job access like 'affirmative' action. I am not the racist DEMOCRATS ARE. There's not a single fucking stat showing that affirmative action is hurting your career prospects. It is true though if an employer knows someone has a black sounding name they're less likely to hire you. Seriously there's way more black ppl that have to do temps because they're NOT crowding white ppl out of the job market. Another example at how obviously racist movement conservatism is: When some asian students were suing ivy league schools for discriminating against them in admissions you ppl decided to blame black students (whose admissions have remained stagnant for the past 35 years) instead of the much larger number of mostly white legacy admissions who are actually the culprit in crowding out Asian admissions to ivy leagues. >MODS BAN THIS DEMOCRAT SHILL HE HAS BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND CANNOT STOP CALLING ME PERSONALLY SLANDEROUS AND FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

I assumed that when people posted child porn the website was doing what any website would do: remove the images, ban the user, and inform the authorities.

No. If you had funding to build the wall something like 20billion dollars you wouldn’t be anywhere near done. You’ll need to raise money to pay for the lawyers when every environmental agency in North America sues the government to stop construction because the wall would have devastating impact on local wildlife. You would have to fund three time the cost to build the wall to maintain it (turns out build a wall along 1000 miles of river is a significant challenge). You’ll also need the money to buy the land. 1000 miles of river front property in Texas. You could eminent domain the land but that would incur a lot more court costs. Also no conservative in their right mind would agree to stealing that much privately owned land from Texans. $1 trillion dollars is more realistic estimate. But in the end it won’t be built. Trump has two more years to get it built. That’s not enough time. A small community in Arizona prevented state government from building a highway that would have been 5 miles from the neighborhood.

Newsflash: you are a pedophile - Lustful, created by fehmunist, for sole purpose of pleasure and hence not protected by sanctuary of marriage, because 'romantic relationship is destroyed by liberals'. In other words...you imply that you can't fuck a kid without having romantic feelings towards a child. Newsflash: you are a text book pedophile. Secondly, Do you think first type of sex is initiated for the sole purpose of baby making, and by your logic has no lust element and happens once in 9 months? Newsflash: in your ideal world, the man in his 30s (or whatever your age is) after falling in love and marrying a 14 year old would not have one session of sex per year. He will have it constantly without any consent from a child, because 'parents gave it away' while you provide a ' willing to feed their daughter until he dies and pay/care for her children emotionally and financially.' You are a pedophile. I would write more but I feel dirty just writing this response. Admit it and go seek help.

">In this semimanifesto, I approach how understandings of quantum physics and cyborgian bodies can (or always already do) ally with feminist anti-oppression practices long in use. The idea of the body (whether biological, social, or of work) is not stagnant, and new materialist feminisms help to recognize how multiple phenomena work together to behave in what can become legible at any given moment as a body. By utilizing the materiality of conceptions about connectivity often thought to be merely theoretical, by taking a critical look at the noncentralized and multiple movements of quantum physics, and by dehierarchizing the necessity of linear bodies through time, it becomes possible to reconfigure structures of value, longevity, and subjectivity in ways explicitly aligned with anti-oppression practices and identity politics. Combining intersectionality and quantum physics can provide for differing perspectives on organizing practices long used by marginalized people, for enabling apparatuses that allow for new possibilities of safer spaces, and for practices of accountability.

"Okay this is gonna be fun. Robbing you idiots of the delusion your race baiting beliefs are confirmed that is. \-First off these numbers don't just include illegal immigrants. It also includes long-term temporary visitors (e.g. guestworkers and foreign students) and permanent residents who have not naturalized (green card holders). So at the outset you're boosting the numbers. It's not just illegals. \-Most of what's counted as welfare is being received by 63% of households. That's 6 in 10 you fucking idiots. \-It's not illegals getting that welfare. It's their legal children qualifying for food stamps and medicaid. \-Food stamps, which 45% of those non-citizen households are receiving, are deficit neutral. Kids getting food stamps doesn't cost you racist paranoid idiots anything. \-38% of native children are receiving welfare. And almost all the benefits illegals can get are through their children. 6 in 10 vs 4 in 10. The disparity isn't that much. And that's only when you slimeballs count green card holders to make the numbers of illegals on welfare seem higher than they really are. \-Only 6% of non-citizen households are receiving cash payments as welfare if you don't count EITC (which is a means tested program for ppl with jobs) compared to 8% of native households. \-It's obvious this anti-immigrant crusade is racially motivated since you're not only trying to get rid of all undocumented ppl, but you're also trying to take away green card status and things like DACA away to give more targets for ERO ICE to go after. It's just about purging as many brown ppl from the US as possible. \-They contribute a net surplus to the economy after welfare program payments are accounted for. &#x200B; So basically a bunch of tax payers have their kids getting medicaid at twice the rate as native households, which they probably wouldn't be trying to get if they had labor law protections and didn't get paid below minimum wage.

Anything short of that will leave the Republicans finding themselves either becoming irrelevant, or having to increasingly move to the left in a desperate attempt to attract minority voters. We got lucky that Trump figured this out and won. Had it been ANY other nominee from the establishment, Republicans would have lost in 2016.

The main issue is that people on both sides did not learn from their mistakes. There were simply way too many problems for tax cuts to be a concern. To me Trump supporters are getting closer and closer to being just like liberals but with different policies. Both sides have pretty much resulted to censorship and name calling more than debates and taking action. I was hoping MAGA would be a movement where people grew up and tried to fix things but instead we just got a right wing flavored pile of shit. The people on the right are incapable of making any decisions or thoughts on their own without Trump’s approval and the people on the left are incapable of making any decisions or thoughts on their own without some corporation’s approval. I can’t even begin to explain the problems we’ll face but I’m 100% certain people will make everything worse and we will have a war to decide who to blame for WW3,t3_a2ne07,TheNewRight

"She is in for a rude awakening if she thinks **she** will have the power to do anything meaningful with her 'Congressional Subpoena Power'...Two reasons: First, Congress only has authority to issue a subpoena 'to investigate any matter that is or might be the subject of legislation or oversight.' Since the Constitution says that Congress shall make NO LAW abridging freedom of speech, an investigation into someone's exercise of free speech would be outside of Congressional lawmaking power and they have no authority to investigate anything outside of their lawmaking power. If she wants to get a subpoena, it will need to be for something other than investigating meme postings. Second, He can choose to ignore the subpoena. If a responding party fails to comply with the subpoena, committee rules typically require a majority vote of the full committee before a resolution of noncompliance may be reported to the parent chamber. This additional requirement operates as a political brake on any committee or subcommittee hastily citing a party for contempt. So, bottom line, even if she concocts some valid reason for the issuance of subpoena, if it is ignored, she can not enforce a contempt sanction by herself. Source: ",t3_a48d9l,TheNewRight

"I was at the White House dinner and was seated at a table of ten with the heads of environmental groups. I cannot get my head around how these people think. They openly admitted that this was all about reducing population growth and how to frustrate it with wetlands to Global Warming these days. They **DO NOT** believe in Global Warming or CO2. They are using this to reduce the population. Ever since Thomas Malthus (1766 – 1834), the English cleric, wrote his 1798 book **An Essay on the Principle of Population**, he set in motion this diehard school of thought that the population would exceed the food production and society was doomed. He also never accounted for (1) cycles in population, (2) cycles in disease (plagues), and (3) improvements in technology in the production of food no less (4) cycles in nature and weather. The Global Warming people are really closet believers in the “Malthusian trap” and they have been lobbying the government to overregulate society to prevent construction and thereby reduce population growth. He saw the population growth as **PREVENTING** real economic progress towards a utopian society. He wrote: ***“The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.”*** Malthus further wrote: *That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,* *That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and,* *That the superior power of population is repressed by moral restraint, vice* and *misery.* &#x200B; I totally disagree with Malthus. His analysis is primitive at best and I regard it as still in the witch-doctor level of thinking. We cannot judge the long-term trends based on current understanding of technology. Quantum Computers, for example, are a completely new way of technology that may lead to a host of new discoveries. These Global Warming people are ignorant of so many aspects. They offer nothing for their analysis is biased, one dimensional, and considers nothing outside of what they want to believe. If you want to be a real **RESEARCH ANALYST**, you have to follow the data not predetermined conclusions or assumptions. ",t3_a4azkw,TheNewRight

"Most of these 'red state welfare' articles and memes are based on assumptions and ignore many significant factors, one of those is not drawing a distinction between actual handouts and Federal spending. 1.) Rich people pay most of our income taxes and usually live in big cities in blue states, which greatly boosts the taxes those states pay to the Fed. The top ten states that are home to the most millionaires only have two red states (TX and FL if you count it as a red state) on the list. 2.) Red states are typically rural, and thus have a great number of Federal projects. Military bases, national parks and research facilities are often located in red states because land is plentiful and cheap compared to much more populated blue states. There's a USDA animal research facility about 15 miles from where I grew up in rural Nebraska, in a county that has a population density of 12/sq mile. Blue New Mexico has one of the highest imbalances between money in/out, largely because its a lower population state and has large Federal energy research laboratories like Los Alamos, which alone has 9000 employees and a $2.2 billion budget. 3.) Then consider the population density issue. Say the government builds one mile of Federal highway in both NJ and NE. The cost of the highway construction will be roughly the same, but NJ (1200 per sq./mile) has way more taxpayers to offset the project compared to NE (24 per sq/mile). The fact of the matter is that Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to receive direct government payments (welfare, food stamps, medicaid, section 8, unemployment, disability, etc.). While most Red states receive more Federal funding than the government collects from those states, that does not mean its residents are hypocrites that directly benefit from that money, as much as left-wingers want to believe that.

It has attracted participants from across the political spectrum including the far-right, anarchists, communists, social democrats and apolitical people concerned with rising fuel costs. Attendees have chanted far-right slogans and have used racist and homophobic rhetoric.

The entire protests were ignited by the fuel tax so, technically speaking, it was 'fascist' from the start in maligning environmentalism. >...That said, an anarchist presence on the ground is important to maintain because firstly, we should reject statist measures such as taxes that eat into the livelihoods of the working class and present an alternate framework that address the problem at its root, capitalism itself.
