Everyday is some bullshit...every day. I’m astounded at the fact that our governments turning a blind eye to various constitutional violations but in addition to the issue that Trump (although maybe not illegal and debatable) was elected with the help of a foreign foe. A foreign government deliberately and very actively assisted in his election. Now we can debate on the legality of all of this but I’m astounded. How do people support him? HOW!? REAL Republicans are abandoning him as they can only stand the stupidity, the show, so much before they can’t stand the fact that he doesn’t want to do his job. His bullshit from the campaign trail of “only I alone can save us” and “I know better than our generals” is actually being spoken behind closed doors in the Oval Office. Republican leaders laughed at the rally but in the White House...”he was...he was uh...umm, he was serious about that!?” I honestly do blame the media like Trump says. We don’t have “news” we have entire 24/7 media sources of “group think” and Trump only accepts the think source that agrees with the agenda of his constituents. He rides on “shock value” and simply coddles his constituents by feeding on their bullshit “group think” stream of so-called “conservative media”. To himself, he’s RUNNING in a reality show. It’s just about rousing people, that’s all he’s doing. Facts? Like the kind that come from his own government agencies, mean nothing. He doesn’t want to be THE president he just wants to be A president. He wants the royalty, the treatment, the power, the perceived respect he demands from the seat, he wants the perks, he wants to be king. It’s all about pissing off the “libtards” destroying the legacy of the first black president and putting a smile on the faces of conservatives while doing this. So he must stay tapped into the bullshit, imbecile mental pacifier that are things like Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and other various social media groups because that’s his goal, to appease to his worshipers in the simplest way possible.

There was a major problem around 2000 with illegal immigration into the USA by people illegally crossing the border rather than overstaying visas. At which point the border fencing was considerably improved and as a result there was a significant decrease in illegal crossings. Since then there has been a drop in the number of all types of illegal immigrants so it is no longer the major issue it was in 2000 and any additional border strengthening really doesn't do anything to stop illegal migration compared to the huge costs. There are far more cost effective methods of dealing with the declining problem of illegal migration than building a wall.,t3_a5tyhd,democrats

"Were they covering up a crime by receiving them and not reporting it to the FBI? If so that is a crime. You aid and abet a crime if you know about criminal activity and actively try to make it succeed. There is also a crime called “misprision of felony” that means you know that a felony has been committed and you actively work to conceal the crime. Receiving property that you know is stolen is a federal crime if the value of that property is at least $5,000. Would the Clinton campaign paid more than $5000 to get them returned? In order to receive these emails, was there any offer of future promises if they won the election? If so, that is illegal. Did anyone that knew about this make any false or misleading statements to the FBI, Congressional Committees or the Mueller investigation? If so, that is illegal and a felony. Did anyone ask for these emails in the campaign? If so, that is a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government which Mueller has already had people indicted for. Given the continuous denials, lies, changing stories and blatant cover up of this entire event by the Trump campaign and administration, if none of these issues are an issue, then why the denials, lies, changing stories and blatant cover up? And why the 81 known contacts with Russians done in secret by the campaign and administration that were also denied and lied about?

"ND born here but haven't lived there in a couple decades. District 27 appears to be a slice of Fargo (ND's largest town), and has around 17,000 residents according to the '16 census. So we're not talking about low population reservation area here. 17K is a good sized number in a state of only 750K total residents. If my understanding of Fargo is still correct, south Fargo is a younger part of town with an average age of 30. So hopefully it will be spotted by aspiring Democrats that there is a shred of progressive thinking in ND. They gave marijuana legalization a shot this year. It failed, but they tried.

"Agree with you 100% here, this guy clearly has no idea what he's talking about. I should add though that a lot of this crash is due to the fact that the surge in stock prices since the recovery has been fueled in large part by stock buybacks, which artificially inflate company values but are inherently unsustainable. The Trump tax cut accelerated this process and extended it by a year, but what you are really seeing right now is two things. The first is companies finally running out of money to continue forcing the market to grow through stock buybacks when GDP growth is still pitiful (which, I'm no economist, but I would guess is at least partially due to the fact that salaries aren't budging, which is keeping people from consuming products at a rate that would allow for actual, tangible economic growth), which is leading to the markets becoming stagnant at best and likely triggering a large scale sell-off as investors try and find a winning stock amongst losers. The second major trend is Trump being an idiot and repeatedly shocking the market when it is already incredibly vulnerable (as I explained above) with his trade war with China bs and forcing Mattis's resignation. Only the second one is really Trump's fault, as the former is entirely on the morons running these corperations that put their own compensation in stocks above their company's long-term viability, but the Cheedo in Chief definetly is not helping.",t3_a9kney,democrats

Either Krugman is talking about how he feels about it, because since there are plans and he is commenting he should have a clear idea of what their plans are. If he disagrees with the plans, that is one thing. But as an expert on the Republican plans, he has found that the plan is to make people sick and to die. Therefore, there is concrete evidence of that truth, or he just feels that way. I assume you are smart enough to do a google search for the Republican plan and look at it. You must be capable enough. I have seen comparisons done by some news outlets, perhaps look at one of those. What I have seen doesn't say anything about people getting sick and dying as two of the objectives. So, Krugman is wrong and anyone who thinks like Krugman is either a sycophant, doesn't have an original thought, cannot even use the basic features of google, or is just a troll them-self. You have not provided any evidence that what Krugman said is true. Your only retort is 'what is the Republican plan, because there isn't one'.

While we have a more favorable map there is still a good chance that we will lose in states like Alabama. We need to continue to find candidates from those states that can push the needle. A good example is O'Rourke. While even though he lost, the gains that were made at the local in texas were huge.

You are right that it only lowered the rate at which healthcare was rising in cost, BUT you are wrong to suggest that we were expect actual rate decreases. It's more reasonable to expect healthcare inflation below normal inflation until equilibrium. You can't just cut a trillion dollars of healthcare bloat and not crash the economy like that.

I’d probably do that too if I was President. I mean he just watches tv, tweets, gets offended, lashes out, and wallows around and feeling bad for himself. Most Presidents and people who are successful and have their lives together are skilled at time management. They can compartmentalize very well too and separate the things happening in their lives and not let it impact everything else. They also delegate and provide support and faith in the people they have helping them. They know there may be a tense relationships and disagreements, and even people you don’t agree with at all but they are very qualified and skilled to do their job well, and they’re all pulling the same direction and expectations are clear.

"Big stock market changes aren't always based on anything tangible; they are as much or more because of psychology than actual economics. If a few people start selling big for no reason relevant to the business, it can start a lot of nervous people to also sell, dropping stock prices. The reverse is also true. As much as I hate to attribute the gains to Trump, it's pretty clear that a lot of the gains in the past two years have been because people have anticipated being able to make large gains because he was going to kill regulations and with Congress cut corporate taxes allowing for higher profits for share holders. Large numbers of people trying to buy while it's still relatively low will let them make a buttload of money. Now that Trump is cracking up, doing things like starting his Trade War and shutting down the government, people are less confident in the market and pulling out, dropping the prices. To your initial question, why would a Democrat think this, while I am as liberal as they come I try not to let my politics prevent me from drawing conclusions from the evidence in front of me.

So when ICE raids a business, it's the CEO/President that owns anyone without proper documentation, so that would be Trump. Perhaps they need to start raiding country clubs in NJ, but then I bet most are owned by Republicans so that won't happen. All show to get rubes like you worked up.

"Blaming democrats is only half of the problem. The other half is republicans, because both parties have perpetrated the real underlying issue (not just the symptoms and triggers), that being easy money monetary policies that have repeatedly blown bubbles into our economy and caused long term instability and malinvestment. Rising interest rates are the main problem, and that’s why trump so adamantly attacks the fed about it, because he knows that’s what is really causing the downturn, and what will eventually put us into recession (if we’re not already in one). The kicker is that they have to rise at some point because if they don’t, inflation goes up and or the Fed has no tools to use come the next recession. The longer they wait to raise them though, the larger the debt bubbles and asset bubbles become, only making the problem worse. We live in a house of cards, and we’re damned if we do and damned if we don’t. Unpopular opinion time: Trump didn’t cause this, tax cuts didn’t cause this, and tariffs didn’t cause this. 0% interest rates and quantitative easing caused this. Yes, tariffs are bad, but blaming them is like blaming a heroin addict who ends up in jail because of robbery, on the robbery itself and not on the heroin. The reason the guy’s life is in shambles is not because he committed a robbery, but because he’s a heroin addict. Likewise, the reason markets are truly going down and will continue to do so is not because of tariffs (they certainly don’t help, but I guarantee you if he called them all off we’d continue to go down overtime), they’re going down because credit markets are tightening in an economy built on debt. For democrats though, this will be a political goldmine. Trump owns the economy now due to all the gloating he did about it earlier in the year (despite Presidents alone only having a mediocre ability at best to impact the economy in the first place), so come 2020 when things look a lot worse than they do now, Democrats should be able to clean house.

"Sanders is near the bottom of my personal list, but I'd still take him over Trump or Pence in a *heartbeat*, and I'd still rather have him as the nominee over Gabbard or Ojeda or a couple other actual Democrats. But if he does become the nominee, I'll do everything I can to make him the next President, and I won't complain about 'holding my nose.' If it's any comfort, if he did become the nominee, I don't see him repeating the process of winning then declining the Democratic nomination in order to run as an independent - doing so would kill federal funding for the party for 2024. >he got hammered in every state south of the Mason and Dixon line, not counting WV which is almost all white To be fair, West Virginia is above the Mason-Dixon line, and a non-insignificant number of his voters said they would support Trump in the general even if he became the nominee. The only Southern state he won was Oklahoma, though the electorate there is whiter than other Southern states. But more to your point, I'm more interested in hearing what candidates bring to the table, rather than hearing expressly negative campaigns. Every single candidate is going to have human flaws to be exploited by opponents, but I don't see the logic behind only campaigning against a rival for the nomination. To me, this is different from raising questions about a candidate - I'm not a fan of Gabbard's stance on Assad or Ojeda's support for Trump, for example - but simply stating a negative headline without context is pointless at best and destructive at worst. Constant negative headlines now among our coalition will only dampen turnout instead of promoting other candidates. ",t3_a928pq,democrats

"Well there's plenty of evidence. Just look at the polling. Trump's favorability among Republicans is at 90%, and hasn't dipped below 80% since 2017 according to Gallup's methodology. The moderate Republican still likes this president, generally speaking. 10, maybe 15% of the vote might be up for grabs. 'I wish he'd be nicer, but I love the policies and in a weird way admire him'. That's the sentiment on a good day, with a RARE, very small contingent of 'Never Trump' people. I'm not saying that some of them won't vote for Kasich or vote for the Democrat, and of course things can change over time. I'm saying I think that number will prove to be much smaller than the number who will vote for Donald Trump, especially when the right-wing engines gear up to 'unify'. You're actually giving everyday Republicans even more credit than I usually do, and I feel like I give them a lot of credit compared to most liberals. Either way though, if your own assumption is right that 'most likely moderates will stay home or vote for the Democrat', we'd be better off not primarying Trump at all, no? I don't agree with that assessment though; in my mind Trump will be the hardest Republican to beat in 2020.

If the two sides listened to the other (not just Democrats listening to gun owners), then a meaningful discussion could begin on the issue, possibly resulting in some solutions to America's gun violence problem.

"Even usually Trump-compliant Stockholm Syndrome Republicans in the House and Senate are issuing statements bordering on panic, all while the Trump noise machine warms up to attack Mattis as a Soros shill, a closeted liberal, and a traitor to the Maximum Leader. Even the Trump White House, a hive of the most morally vacant and cowardly bootlicks ever assembled, found themselves relying on Mattis, even if they never trusted him. If Trump ever realizes how much his own White House staff counted on the Marine general turned SECDEF to control his impulsive defense and foreign-policy decisions, he’ll have a Twitter stroke. Unlike Trump’s low-rent “but muh troops” rah-rah, Jim Mattis truly loves the men and women in the armed services. He understands what orders to send American men and women into harm’s way imply. He knows how to precisely apply the war-fighting discipline and strategic vision that had made him one of the eminent military leaders of our generation. Low, weak men like Donald Trump may pretend to praise people like Mattis, but always secretly revile those who possess virtues and values they lack. Trump resented Mattis for his accomplishments, his judgment, and his knowledge. Donald Trump, a man of the most shallow intellect and indifferent ability, faced a man who has forgotten more about war, diplomacy, and strategy that Trump has ever learned. Mattis raised young Marines from every ethnic background into warriors fighting for a bigger idea than race or ethnicity; **Trump is the most overt racist to hold the American presidency since Woodrow Wilson.** Trump believes the troops exist for performance-art-like border-wall creation and parades to honor the Maximum Donald; Mattis knows they’re putting their lives on the line for the nation and the Constitution, and he honors them with missions that make America safer, not his ego bigger. Trump knows on some deep, basal level that he’s a figure of mockery and cordial (at best) dislike by leaders of America’s traditional allies, and is seen as an easy mark by our adversaries. Trump saw how often Mattis had to clean up messes President Best Brain made in China, North Korea, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and across Europe. Worse, he saw that the leaders of those nations respected Mattis in a way he couldn’t beg, borrow, or steal. It must have been galling to him to serve this cowardly, venal, weak, and capricious man, but it was one more mission in a lifetime of service. The departure of Jim Mattis from his role as secretary of defense is one more dangerous moment in a constellation of dangerous moments for this country, and this presidency.

I don't know why it is difficult for people to grasp the idea I am not here to debate different proposals. I wouldn't want to do that here anyway.

"I said a good idea, their idea of strong opposition to illegal immigration is not only fucking idiotic (They only care about brown skinned illegal immigrants they ignore all others) but it is further so because it's predicated on their complete lack of understanding of our actual immigration laws. Now, our immigration laws ARE a mess that need to be cleaned up - and people should not enter the country illegally. A good idea, as opposed to their white identity politics driven idea, would be to reform both the laws to make them more understandable and accessible while also reforming enforcement to go after employers who knowingly employee unauthorized immigrants - and make the fines meaningful. The latter item would be an actual real enforcement item with teeth, rather than the boondoggles the alt right has proposed they've proposed. Illegal border crossings have also been going down for years:  Visa overstay is the primary issue:  their boondoggle retarded border wall would not even address that, not to mention be ineffective at actually stopping illegal border crossings.",t3_a089yo,democrats

Forcing others to apologize for saying mean words or forcing comedians to exile themselves from crowds who don't understand jokes is not the correct policy.. it's censorship, and antithetical to a progressive platform. As Maher himself has said, 'a madmen broke into the Whitehouse, while liberals were policing language.' And what are we doing now? Debating if Elizabeth Warren is Native American enough to warrant her telling the University she worked out that she was part Native American. Give me a break. Again, Bill Maher is just keeping us accountable to the ideals that we say are important to us. I don't recall Maher groveling cause he said the N-word. Maher said on the very next show, ''I don't want to pretend that this is more of a race thing than a comedian thing,” he said to Dyson at one point, growing cocky. “Comedians are a special kind of monkey.' Can a guy not genuinely apologize? Is he not doing exactly what he preaches there? Apologizing, but not being willing to flagellate himself? He was ALWAYS fine with Bernie running. He just thought it was a dumbfuck idea to protest vote against Hillary after the primary... which it was. Maher wants progressives to win.

"You said most Trump voters aren’t racist, they are just tired of political correctness. Which means they voted for a racist because they’re tired of “the left” being intolerant of racism. How does that connect at all? People are not mad at the Democrats for trying to fight racism. They are mad at the Democrats because people are sick of callout culture, like going back into people's twitter feed from 10 years ago and trying to get them fired because of it. People didn't vote for Trump because they want to stop the fight against racism, they voted for him because he offered a way out to those in America who feel downtrodden. If I asked the average American 'What are some of Donald Trump's objectives?' people could probably name quite a few off the bat: Build the Wall, Drain the Swamp, bring back factories. If I asked you the same about Hillary, it would be more difficult for the average person. That is largely a marketing failure by Hillary but it cost her nonetheless. All racism is bigotry. That is not true at all. It is possible to be a genuine racist and be understanding. I'm not saying that being a racist is a respectable view, but it is possible to be racist and still be tolerant of your opponent. I sorta don't know why I explained that at all, since you are going to smear me regardless. Most bigotry (in this country) is based on racism. That is most certainly not true. Out of all the acts of intolerance in this country, the vast majority are angry political ideologues who just scream at people with whom they disagree. >Furthermore, how does one show tolerance for a bad idea? I only call for tolerance in that I don't want people to be shut down because of their opinions. If you find a racist person and want to disprove their arguments at every turn, go ahead.

"corporate PAC money False  You need to learn what Citizens United was about because it wasn't about this. This is the least problematic source of money except for individual donations there is. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), is a landmark U.S. constitutional law, campaign finance, and corporate law case dealing with regulation of political campaign spending by organizations. The United States Supreme Court held (5–4) on January 21, 2010, that the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by nonprofit corporations, for-profit corporations, labor unions, and other associations. In the case, the conservative non-profit organization Citizens United sought to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts shortly before the 2008 Democratic primary election in which Clinton was running for U.S. President. The federal law, however, prohibited any corporation (or labor union) from making an 'electioneering communication' (defined as a broadcast ad reaching over 50,000 people in the electorate) within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of an election, or making any expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a candidate at any time. The court found that these provisions of the law conflicted with the United States Constitution. The court upheld requirements, however, for public disclosure by sponsors of advertisements. The case did not affect the federal ban on direct contributions from corporations or unions to candidate campaigns or political parties. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion found that the BCRA §203 prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech.",t3_a8r517,democrats

The problem is they don’t think anything is racism unless the n-word was used in anger. They don’t consider things like following black people in retail stores or fucking shooting them for no goddamn reason to be racist. Institutional racism does not exist to them. I am a white person that has lived in Alabama. I can tell you with 100% certainty that people will say they aren’t racist but then curse the black teenager down the street because their garden gnome is missing. Or they aren’t racist but they think having too many black people has ruined their old high school. These are things that I heard with my own ears. A girl I knew briefly asked me not to have black friends over when she was there too. She didn’t consider herself racist. Of course this isn’t all republicans and certainly not all southerners or white people. Or even southern white republicans.

Never said that all. You really want to make a straw man in which I did say that... so you can win I guess. But nope, that was never my point. This whole 'freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences' shtick is basically the first stop whenever anyone talks about Freedom of Speech, so I'm guessing this is where you're trying to steer the conversation, because this is where you're most comfortable. &#x200B; But again, you seem to be confusing the will of the public with the will of HBO, which are not necessarily the same, and forcing me into this free speech definitional argument, which I never agued.. Now, if the PC police came and swarmed HBO and told them to fire Maher or they'll unsubscribe, and HBO complies and fires him... is that impinging his free speech? No, it is not. Let me repeat that again. No, it is not. But is it an example of censorship? It is. It's an example of what I was talking about in which liberals sometimes feel like they can tell people what is and what is not funny... what is and what is not acceptable. Again, I say.. you can be cool with that. As a progressive who believes in a pluralistic society, I'm not cool with that. Maher isn't cool with that.

You seem to be more interesting in 'winning' this argument like we are at an academic decathlon than in actually understanding his point. That's where you frustration comes in. You don't like Bill Maher, because you don't want to like Bill Maher for some reason. You don't want to take any time to understand his point.. or even read a summary of it.

It's not totally the same as last time, but right there's an example of a MAJOR swing state that Kasich can straight-up hand over to the Democratic nominee, if he chose to go for it. But all things considered, I do think any of these generic Republicans would take away from Trump more than they would take away from the Democrat, and in 2016 Trump won 3 states by a combined 70K votes.

The other key piece of context is that Russian and Chinese Surface-to-Air missiles have improved by leaps and bounds over the last few years, and the ability to launch a huge weapons payload from outside of SAM range is priceless. It doesn't matter if the F16 is almost as good as the F15, that's the difference between a successful mission and getting swatted by a SAM.

For example, from a statistical dataset, you can deduce a mean and standard deviation, which are the moments of a normal distribution, which is a probabilistic concept. Further, here are some *facts* based on actual data: if you bothered to check the references of the article: 1. The percentage of criminals that are illegal immigrants is 21%. 2. The percentage of criminals in the US is 2%. 3. The percentage of illegal immigrants is 3.7%. Using Bayes' Theorem, you can combine all of these FACTS based on actual data together to conclude that the percentage of criminals that are illegal immigrants, or equivalently the percentage of illegal immigrants that commit crimes is 11.35%. So, it is very much a FACT deduced using Bayes' theorem: P(C|ii) = P(ii | C) * P(c) / P(ii)! ",t3_a84d6w,democrats

I disagree as I have not seen anything in writing anywhere specifically outlining that in their plan. It seems like you have seen specific language stating that they want people to get sick and die. If you haven't seen that language, and you believe that is the plan, then you feel that is the plan. I doubt if any Republicans want people to get sick or to die, far from it. Republicans may have their own ideas that Krugman gets emotional about, I am not versed enough to debate it, but I also don't want to debate it. Why would I debate a plan I don't support?

"Hey, and every previous president has had either governing or military experience. Stats only tell you so much. This is much different, because guys like Kasich and Sasse (at least from what they tell us) come at this from such a vastly different place than the base does. We've talked about it before, but I don't see any reason to believe his 90% approval among his own party will dip much, and he hasn't fallen below 80% since his first year in office. He's managed to get his drones to hand-wave away every problem with his administration as 'fake news, fake news, the deep state is just out to get him'. Some of these senators and governors really seem to think Trump is a threat to the republic, or they've paid lip service to it anyway. There's too much pro-Trump pressure within the party to take him down in a primary; and most of them have lined up behind him like cowards since they fear the base. The support just won't be there IMO. If I had to rank the likelihoods of the ways Trump can leave office, I'd say: 1. Losing the general in 2020 2. Impeachment/resignation 3. Randomly hit by a bus 4. Losing a GOP primary, with their voters.

There needs to be some regulation in a free market to prevent rampant inequity but enough freedom so that everyone has a chance to get rich based on their abilities and effort. Without aspects of a free market there is no incentive to innovate and prosper. The people who work harder and are more gifted will not receive equal compensation to their work in a market where equity is more important.

Number of F-16's built = 4500+. Loss ratio F-15 = 10.3%, F-16 6%. And the roles bit? That's surprising since the F-15 was built as an air superiority fighter and the F-16 as multi-role. There is a reason the F-16 is the most popular modern fighter in history, In Red/Green team simulations, the F-16 has been shown to be the superior fighter against Soviet/Russian MiGs. I can build 2 for 1 F-16's to F-15's. **These upgraded F-16s would include about 300 Block 40 and 50 jets already in service, and the AESA upgrade would likely go along with the structural and avionics upgrades. So it kind of gives us new life in the F-16. The USAF says they would fly the type till 2048 under the plan—but potentially at the expense of the F-15C/D fleet.** You're along the right track, and airplanes and equipment are so expensive these days. Almost prohibitively so. But you can't afford to keep a bunch of aging F-15s around for sentimental purposes and that's essentially what they're doing. They're not needed.

"I have faith in the greed and stupidity of republicans. The US debt is equivalent if a person with a 30,000 income was spending 45,000 dollars a year, and owed 150,000 in debt, with interest, and balancing the budget was hard and they were going to accelerate to 50,000 just from interest payments soon. If I were a credit card company, I would not lend that person 5,000 dollars, let alone 150,000 dollars. That is what the current bond market looks like. So, trump is racking up more debt. By the time he leaves office, we will be paying 55,000 a year, make 30,000 a year, and have 225,000 in debt. The future president will be faced with raising taxes, and cutting military, social, and scientific spending to service the debt. However, there is only so much fat that can be cut before you start going through meat and bone. My worry, is that even with cutting all discretionary spending and putting it towards the debt, we will be spending 31,000 a year in paying for debt, and only making 30,000 a year so to speak. W won't be able to balance the budget, even with every expenditure cut. At that point, the government has some options - declare bankruptcy, seize civilian assets to pay for government expenses, or print money. They can't seize assets and survive politically. If they declare bankruptcy, the US loses its status as the world reserve currency, and every nation in the world races to be the first to dump all their us dollars for gold. If they print money, the dollar will be devalued. They can't take option one without being declared kleptocrats, and being expelled from power. Taking option two is really bad for american image, as well as economy, however option three is slightly more controllable than option two. Ultimately, they might even take a mix of the various options, but at the end of the day, to make ends meet, the US government will have their hand forced to destroy the value of the dollar, and all of the guns and missiles in the world can't stop it. Its economics. That is why the dollar is going to zero, and its going to take everyone else with it. However, everyone else will realize they are being taken along for a ride, and will dump us dollars to save themselves. Depending on how few dollars they have, this will actually save some of them. I can see many of the EU states surviving, russia will survive, iran, pakistan etc will survive. China will feel the hurt, but they will live. Mark my words. In 10 years, you will cry when you remember this post. The guy telling you to buy bitcoin because reasons.

Since the 2016 election I started using RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) for the tagging function. Whenever I would come across someone who looked like a supporter of the criminal Trump I would tag them with yellow as a 'Potential Trump Supporter x1'. If I saw them blatantly support him again or say something shady I would change the x1 to x2. Once they had gone over x3 I would change the tag to red and just read 'Trump Supporter'. I have been doing this for a little over 2 years now and it is kind of amazing how many people show up in different areas now.

"Hussein was a dictator, using chemical weapons on Kurds, invading Kuwait, slaughtering Kurds in a fashion similar to the holocaust. In the United States if things *truly* got bad enough we can impeach the president. But in order for the Kurds and the Shiites to rebel they had to literally wage war. There is no impeachment, there are no checks and balances, there isn’t anyone stopping him from killing hundreds of thousands of people. Trump isn’t the best, by NO means. But he is very far from the likes of Sadam Hussein. He isn’t using chemical weapons, he isn’t slaughtering another nation of people. The worst thing he’s signed off on was recent bombings in Syria that lead to some 50 or so civilian deaths, which is inexcusable. But I would love to see a piece of evidence putting the responsibility on trump for the deaths of hundreds of thousands through means of chemical weapons or rounding up of civilians for them to be murdered. I think the situation you pose is unrealistic just because of how far Sadam and Trump are from each other. You’re talking about a literal dictator with no checks and balances compared to a removable president. With 2 separate entities of government stopping him from damaging the world beyond repair. So to answer your question, obviously my answer is no. But there is a major difference in bombing the city of a wild dictator than a president with checks. ",t3_a9qa2v,democrats

"The idea is really creating money, not just printing it. Tbh I don't know if there is a lack of currency (either printed or digital) in the US. Determining that would be complicated, because we would need to inventory all the resources in the country (human, natural, technological, educational, potential, by skills and trades) and the sum of the value of these can actually just be a base understanding because these resources can multiply exponentially in value once they are acquired by the final consumer. This then would be compared to the inventory of currency in the country (printed and digital) to try to find out if there is too much or too little currency. But you also have to think about that Congress is ever increasing the giant bubble of debt so you would have to weigh whether it is better to have an ever increasing bubble of debt or instead create money without taxation.",t3_a7if4p,democrats

But at the very least we can condemn people who use disgusting and torturous methods of killing people, like gas chambers and chemical weapons. I’m not saying we SHOULDNT condemn people who use bombs, but chemical weapons are far worse and are actual torture, plus the effects can be seen GENERATIONS after the people affected by them die. Example, agent orange, which if we had known at the time how bad it was the US should’ve been condemned for. At the end of the day me and you just disagree. I feel like taking down am rampant dictator. You think American presidents and dictators act the same. There isn’t really any way to have me see into them at view because I think it’s just flat out wrong, and I’ve explained why. To answer your question, I explained in the other comment. President Bush didn’t say “Aight let’s go fuck up some civilians”, Sadam did.

None of them did anything to notify authorities. In fact, they acted to conceal this information. Trump famously blamed it on a fat guy in a basement or the Chinese. They knew a foreign adversary was working to undermine the integrity of our election, and did nothing to stop it - in fact, they encouraged it (Trump's famous line '*Russia, in case you're listening...'*). That's the *best case scenario*, and it's pretty damning from a moral, ethical and possibly legal standpoint. *having said all of that, here's a little backstory on what's going on.* Putin uses state-owned banks, energy firms and a handful of Russian 'businessmen' aka oligarchs, to launder money from criminal activity tied to Russian Mafia, corruption and other sources.

"A couple things, there’s really no such thing as a true free market. No matter what there’s regulations, there’s barriers to entry, there’s taxes, for a free market to be stable, you want someone to play referee and make sure that one person doesn’t get taken advantage of and they can’t do anything to make it fair. Fiscal Conservatives(I won’t say republicans because they no longer support free markets and trade) they believe regulations be it, safety, environmental, how they handle their money and what they tell their clients and shareholders is too much government intervention and the free market will sort it out because the ones that are shady will go out of business eventually or someone will come in and do it better and the first one will have to improve their product to stay in business. They believe taxes slow the economy down, especially on business. There’s a concept called the laffer curve, basically it’s a big u on a graph. Tax rate on the bottom, government revenues is the vertical axis. The higher the tax rate goes it will peak and revenues get reduced despite increase tax rates. That’s why they always want to lower taxes. The first few times it was implemented though the tax rates were pretty much double what they are now. Another big reason they tend to sustain as well despite usually growing quickly early, in an unregulated economy companies will take the lower regulations and cut costs and still increase profits allowing them to expand, and expand, and expand. It creates an oligopoly where there’s only a few providers competing and they tend to work in synch with how they price things and usually it just increases. Edit: Part 2 Democrats believe that there should not be asymmetric information in business. People should be clear what they are going to do with you money or what they will provide you and want to make sure the person with the most money just makes their own rules for how they conduct business. Democrats believe in raising taxes to compensate and provide a social safety net for people who get burned by the nature of capitalism. They may lose a job but they should still be able to eat. Just because they live in a poorer area doesn’t mean the river that flows through their neighborhood can be contaminated. Fiscal conservatives belief cutting spending is the best way to keep our countries fiscally stable and trustworthy. Democrats believe our spending is vital to our country but there needs to be an increase in revenue by an increase in taxes on some. That’s where the vicious cycle is at, raising taxes is an absolute deal breaker as is cutting military spending which makes up close to half of the government expenditures for Fiscal Conservatives, meanwhile cutting social programs like Medicare/Medicaid, unemployment, welfare, food stamps, social security, education, is a nonstarter. Basically there’s a blind faith that free markets and capitalism without a lot of government interference is ideal and the market will correct the issues itself. Democrats have a more nuanced view that people will act in self interest and not worry about what happens as a result and or down the line. They also strongly believe that there’s a lot of things for the good of the country and society that have no monetary returns but are necessary and that is something the government should take on and use their revenues because a little bit from each person makes the cost of the big thing manageable. The democrat version, depending on the degree spectrum of the market just means the wealth and power is less concentrated to the extremely wealthy and elite and that financial mobility is possible.

Trump and Bush didn’t change the rules to gain an unfair advantage.

Your issue is with electoral reform. So campaign on electoral reform like everyone else. Don’t call into question a result that is corroborated by the rules set in place hundreds of years ago. Call into question the rules. I dislike both Trump and Bush as candidates and wouldn’t have/ won’t vote for them ever. I think Trump is tanking the nation, I think he is corrupt, I think he is a terrible stain on the Presidency. I still think he was elected President.

" >Truly, I can understand how someone might read that and be like 'really, MORE importantly? Bad choice of words, Bernout'. That is certainly *an* issue with the statement, but I think the bigger one is the juxtaposition - the othering - of the people in marginalized groups against 'ordinary Americans'. But I don't think it's all that fair to extrapolate Bernie's focus on the working class into meaning the 'white' working class. To be clear, when I say he's focused on the white working class, what I essentially mean is that while his policies would help working class people of all ethnicities and genders and sexualities, a large portion of his rhetoric is based around - for lack of a better term - absolving white working class voters for their bigotry. You didn't vote for Trump *because* he's a bigot, you did it in spite of that, so you aren't a bigot! >And I'm sure part of that does include him wanting to bring more of the white working class back towards the left too, as statistically they vote against their own best interests more than perhaps any other demographic group. I think the clear response to this is - are they? Economically, perhaps, but if their interests are white supremacy and anti-multiculturalism.. well, the Republican party is doing that pretty well! This is the heart of the issue, really. Bernie's hypothesis is that people aren't bigoted - they're tricked into *being* bigoted by the elites or the 1% or whoever to distract them and keep them divided from the non-white, non-LGBT working class. But this denies bigots their agency. During the civil war, non-slave holders fought to uphold an institution that they might not even have benefited from! Why? Because however poor and destitute they might've been, however looked down on socially, they were one step above a slave. That social satisfaction led them to fight and die, and I think it's that very same social satisfaction that keeps Republican voters coming back. >but what do you think he should've strived to do more of, that could've made you more supportive of him? To be honest? He just needed and needs to learn. He's a very old-school socialist and intersectionality is something he hasn't quite seemed to grasp. ",t3_a778mh,democrats

I used to agree that things like single payer and free college tuition would solve all our problems overnight but graduate school and going to work in government changed my perspective a lot and l came to see too many problems with implementing something like that for me to be fully behind it. He also gives trump voters too much of a pass on their racism. These people didn’t vote for Trump for economic reasons. They voted for him because he wants to make America white again. Biden has said some silly things over the years, and I see risks nominating him. But he spent eight years in the Obama White House and I liked the idea of continuity. I also think he could appeal the best to various demographics within the party. You want African Americans, he was vice to the first black president. You want blue collar white voters, he seems to speak their language.

I was covered by a fraudulent Obamacare insurance company that quickly went bankrupt after taking millions in Administration loans to float it.  Fraudulent?? You betcha. They frankly lied to clients that they had many providers in their website -- it took me months to find the lone pcp out of hundreds they said they had. And that sole provider teaching hospital did overcharge exuberantly. Nearly 20 k for a 45 min standard hernia operation that the surgeon only got 1700. Normal prices across country are 6k for such an operation. The insurance didn't cover it all and I got billed for the rest even though I was low income and subsidized.

Health Republic was created as one of 23 Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans, known as CO-OPs, established under the Affordable Care Act to increase competition in the marketplace and give consumers a voice in their healthcare. Health Republic began selling insurance plans to individuals and small groups, both on and off the NY State of Health marketplace, in October 2013.During the 2013-2014 Open Enrollment period, Health Republic captured the largest marketshare on the New York State of Health marketplace. It became the largest CO-OP in the country during this period.In September 2014, Health Republic members were able to vote for Member Directors on the CO-OP's Board of Directors, with nine members ultimately elected from across the state, making up a majority of the Board.For 2015, Health Republic expanded its service area by 11 counties upstate to a total of 43 counties statewide; added two new products: an out-of-network plan for small groups and a higher-deductible plan for individuals; and expanded its provider network in the Albany areaOn September 27, 2015, Health Republic announced that it would begin the processes of ceasing operations, effective immediately. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a6qfni,democrats

"Sure, so that's actually a really good question that I didn't answer. Online voting would probably be really great for turning out the vote, and I'm a big fan of technology. The issue is essentially that we want voting to be as transparent as possible, but of course the votes have to be secret and anonymous. When we vote, we need to make sure the votes are secure and can't be changed after they're cast. With paper ballots, we lock them in a closet and never let anyone touch them without people from multiple parties watching. With digital ballots, there's no way to confirm the ballots weren't changed after they were cast. We could allow the votes to be tied back to the original person who cast them (so they could verify their vote), but this would allow coercion in exchange for votes by forcing people to share their ID numbers. That's not ideal, but if we allowed the votes to be anonymous then there'd be no way to trust whatever counted them. Paper ballots make changing votes a lot harder, and importantly they allow for us to perform a recount. Changing a million paper ballots would take a literal army, whereas changing a million digital ballots could take a literal couple of foreign agents. The more people need to be involved in the attack, the more likely it would fail and be discovered. So by making the voting happen in a somewhat annoyingly paper way, we're making the attack vectors a lot smaller. Another advantage of paper is that it's understandable. This theoretically is irrelevant to the count, but people are going to have a hard time understanding how computers work, just because they 'aren't computer people'. They'll have to just trust someone that the computers aren't cheating, and so people are more likely to get frustrated with not understanding. Paper ballots are a lot easier to understand, so this helps the appearance of fairness by making more people able to understand exactly what's happening. Think of how many people at your office can't use a spreadsheet, and realize that those people still should be allowed to understand the process if we can. I'm actually in favor of paper ballots that are filled in by computer if you desire. So there would be a paper ballot that you receive at your polling station, and you'd put it into a machine. The monitor would help you read the ballot by being designed well and being large enough for people to read. You'd make your choices on the monitor, which would legibly complete the ballot for you by marking the lines on the ballot. This would help, because it could pre-check that you didn't miss any options. Then you'd take your ballot and place it into another machine (the counting machine) which would show you your selections again and accept your ballot or reject it if you made a mistake. The counting machine would tally a count, and the previous machine would tally a count as well. But most importantly, these are estimated counts, and the paper ballots are the real votes. The pre-count numbers could be reported the day of, but random selections of machines should be chosen to perform verification hand-counts, to know that the machines aren't making mistakes. Only after these verifications are complete would the pre-counts be accepted and submitted as the official counts. If any of the counts differ, then additional counts would have to be performed to determine where the error was. A big advantage of this system I prefer is that the machines are entirely optional. You could use the paper ballot and a normal marker just fine, and someone could choose to do that. The machines help keep things legible, and help estimate the results much faster, but in no way do the machines ever destroy a ballot that's cast, so anyone can always review the ballots by hand should they choose to. To address the question of ease of voting, I like that Florida has millions of people who vote by mail. I think this should be required everywhere, and the postage should be paid by the elections offices. Perhaps the USPS would offer a reduced rate or the federal government would subsidize the mailing of ballots containing federal races. It's much easier in my opinion to vote at home by taking my time looking up candidates on my computer rather than voting in person somewhere else. This does theoretically allow for more possibility of coercion (like an employer could demand you bring your ballots into work to complete), but expanding accessibility to everyone is vitally important, and many people don't have the free time to go vote while the polls are open, even if there are early voting days. Maybe they don't have reliable transportation, or maybe they work at night and need to sleep during the day when the polls are open, or so many other possible reasons. ",t3_a1u06t,democrats

"I totally understand your concerns and where you are coming from. It's complicated. To play devil's advocate... in the eyes of a Green Party or Libertarian Party voter, they're thinking if they get a certain percentage of the vote (whatever it may be), it will force the rest of the political establishment to pay them more attention, with the idea being that they can't win without them. Using that to build leverage, etc. I know these details sound absurd in the wake of Donald Trump's destructive election and presidency. But I think from a Stein voter's perspective... the environment is really their top issue in all of politics, and what they see is Donald Trump being a 0/10 on that issue, Hillary Clinton being a 5 or 6/10 on that issue, and coming away feeling like 'both parties are exactly the same' or whatever the fuck. Now, I TOTALLY disagree with that; I think it's crazy to say both parties are the same, but that's the mindset of some of the folks who are passionate about our need to address climate change much more vigorously. Many of those voters are only engaged in politics because the Greens exist in the first place, and I'm pretty sure I saw a study that indicated HRC would have only gotten a small fraction of them (if they were forced to vote for someone else). Truth be told, I think the Democrats would be best served politically by moving in a 'Greener' direction, but that's a whole other discussion. But don't get me wrong: I still agree with you. I really wish they would've sucked it up in this case, especially in swing states. Donald Trump is a special case, and one of the worst presidents in our nation's history. We could've at least put the pressure on Hillary to do the right thing on issues like fracking, there's no reasoning with this jackass in office.

While they *can* leave amendments open to ratification indefinitely, most recent attempts at amendments have a 10 or 20 year period for ratification. Several of the things you list wouldn't require amendments either - Special prosecutor: we had a special prosecutor law in the wake of Nixon that was bipartisan. It quickly became abused during the Clinton administration and was quietly allowed to lapse at the end of Clinton's administration (or beginning of Bush, I don't recall the exact timing). Congress could easily redo that law. Placing it in the Constitution could easily lead to ridiculous investigations like the Ken Starr one being impossible to rein in. - Campaign Finance: A lot can be down within Supreme Court law. Could even challenge the existing case law that lead to Citizen's United, and possible get it overturned (though that would require a very different Court). - Corporate personhood: this is just a statute, so Congress could repeal it. However, it is important to note that entity personhood serves a critical purpose in our legal system, so we would either need a seismic shift in how our legal system is structured, or just limit how far the personhood goes. - Civil Asset forfeiture: at the federal level, this could be done without Amendments.

"That's a hell of a logical leap, knowing almost none of the context. To try and summarize a very complex argument: every movement has a bell curve of participation, on one extreme people who agree with you but do nothing about it, a big middle with people in various degrees of activity, and then another small group who take it too far. A liberal example would be animal rights. Some of us do nothing. Many become vegans, or volunteer at shelters, or advocate for legal action. A small group commit illegal acts against animal testing facilities. So, as a member of any political group, it is your responsibility to advocate your position and the position of your group. It is also your responsibility to make sure that your rules of engagement are clear, so that your extreme elements never get TOO extreme. If you're a media personality or a leader in the org, your responsibility is that much greater. Now, the crux of the argument; those extreme conservatives who hurt and kill SHOULD NOT represent the whole of conservatism. But they do, because the president says there are 'fine people on both sides'. Because Fox News runs pieces that either ignore the violence or frame it as the fault of Democrats. If influential conservatives would speak up and condemn these things full throatedly, encourage people to listen to their liberal countrymen and build consensus, we'd be in a much better pace. But that's not happening. So yes, too answer your question, they currently represent all conservatives. But they don't have too. ",t3_a1s8md,democrats
"So every group has some degree of tribalism, since it’s a trait inherent to humans. However, conservatives seem to combine tribalism with an inability (or unwillingness) to empathize with anyone outside their tribe. They very easily reduce other people to very simple enemy stereotypes and then moralize that stereotype so it is dangerous or inferior. They value conformity and the appearance of stability. Things that rock the boat are frightening unless those things hurt outsiders. Anything that makes them uncomfortable must be rejected or downplayed to maintain the feeling of safety, even if it is against their interest. Often they value personal responsibility and downplay the influence of environment or society. Every aspect of a person (especially an outsider) is a personal choice. Even things like being born poor can be seen as a moral failing on the part of the individual. Moreover, conservatives who are poor see themselves as middle class or justify their condition as the fault of outsiders. And finally, because they value feelings over facts and critical thinking, they are more susceptible to misinformation and confirmation bias. In many cases, opinions carry the same weight as fact and personal anecdotes are more true than statistics. None of these things are unique to conservatives and can be found among progressives also, but the specific combination of these factors makes conservatives especially dangerous to themselves and everyone around them.",t3_aao73i,democrats

"Thank you for the response, obviously amendments would be stronger defenses against abuses than simply passing some law that can easily be overturned by a court decision or a new congress. Because they can be solved by regular means does not and should not preclude at least VOTING on amendments, and you know that voting on amendments is just as much about pushing an agenda it is signaling to your base, to get support for the rest of the amendments. These are not stand alone previsions, they are all a response to Trump and its time democrats started growing some backbone if they want to be taken seriously by a very weak President. I have two issues with this, which is why I responded. First, Amendments become the highest law in the land, so passing them as a reactionary measure requires considerable, careful planning. For example, an Amendment regarding the independent counsel could easily be abused. Imagine a Hillary Clinton presidency with a GOP Congress. It would be an endless stream of independent counsels into the tiniest of things. By the end of the Ken Starr investigations into Bill Clinton, even Starr thought the independent investigator had too much authority - which is why the law sunsetted. The most reactionary amendment we have, the 11th, was passed very quickly after a Supreme Court case. Easily, it is the poorest written. Second, voting on Amendments that are either (1) risky or (2) impossible to actually adopt, accomplishes nothing. It makes it look like the Dems are grandstanding. What happens in the Senate passes these things, knowing the states will reject? Then the GOP gets a free pass to say 'look we protected the special counsel/addressed campaign finance/etc.'. Passing these things as legislation both increases the chance they actually become law, *and* decreases the ability of the GOP to deflect. Remember after 2000 and 2016 when Democrats were furious about the electoral college? When democrats worked day and night to end it? Oh wait, thats right, they didnt, because they are bad at leading. You mean when the Dems didn't control the house, so they couldn't bring legislation to the floor? Or when they didn't control the Senate? You have a reasonable argument to be mad about it, but you need to temper that with reality. As far as corporate person hood, we had a ballot measure in our state to amend the state constitution and it was overwhelmingly passed, by more than 60% of the voters. Corporations are not people, and attitudes about trying to protect them as such is how we got to where we are today, with people saying they are somehow 'Critical'. they absolutely are not. There are innumerable laws written in a way that 100% taking away corporate personhood would throw the legal system and business world into chaos if it were not done correctly. I am completely 100% behind limiting corporate personhood (or making corporations have to deal with the burdens, such as breaking laws means losing licence (i.e. going to jail)), but as it should be clear by the rest of my post, I want to do it in a way that does not cause havoc--and then backlash.",t3_aax0u1,democrats

"Fugazi (/fuˈɡɑːzi/; foo-GAH-zee) is an American punk rock band that formed in Washington, D.C. in 1987. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty. Fugazi are noted for their unique sound, blending of elements of dub/reggae with high energy rock and punk/hardcore-styled guitars, as well as for their business practices and contempt towards the music industry. The band, and others from the punk and hardcore scene leading up to the early 1990s, were among the early adopters of what grew to be known as the DIY ethic. Fugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours, produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world. Fugazi has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003. Dave Grohl is a big fan of Fugazi and thus they are an influence on the Foo Fighters.",t3_a4fw8g,democrats

">But Warren and Sanders are hardly identical progressives. They have markedly different approaches to empowering the working class. In the simplest possible terms, **Warren wants to organize markets to benefit workers and consumers, while Sanders wants to overhaul those markets, taking the private sector out of it.** This divide—and where Warren or Sanders’s putative rivals position themselves on it—will determine the future of the Democratic Party for the next decade or more. >**Warren’s suite of policies, rolled out in recent months, all try to reform rules that empower the wealthy at the expense of regular Americans.** Her Accountable Capitalism Act would ensure worker representation on corporate boards, and require large corporations to consider all its stakeholders—not just investors but workers, consumers, and communities of interest—in any decision-making. Her climate bill would force public companies to disclose climate-related risks, giving investors more information to use their money toward sustainable goals. >Her housing bill would transfer money for affordable housing to communities that adopt zoning policies to make it easier to build. Her 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act seeks structural separation of commercial and investment banks to keep companies making the riskiest trades away from taxpayer-funded bailouts. And the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act would buttress these gains by reducing the role of special interest lobbying in federal policymaking. >**Sanders, while concerned with making markets fairer, would rather just rip them up,** either through limiting how much companies can grow or instituting publicly funded options alongside them. He would put a hard cap on the size of financial institutions to make them more manageable. He would make public colleges and universities tuition-free, rather than expanding access for certain needy students. He would create a federal jobs guarantee through 2,500 American Job Centers nationwide, and he estimates that his $1 trillion infrastructure investment would support 13 million publicly funded jobs as well. And in health care, he would simply nationalize the insurance sector, putting everyone on a Medicare-style plan. >I am leaving out some nuance. **Both Warren and Sanders support single-payer health care**, an example of nationalizing a market. They both want a public option for financial services through simple bank transactions at the post office. Sanders’s Workplace Democracy Act changes the rules to make it easier to form unions, a classic market-restructuring move. His proposed bill to tax employers whose workers receive federal benefits influenced Amazon’s increase of its entry-level wages, and that was the intent: organizing private-sector labor markets without taking them over or imposing standards. >**But the two senators disagree over the best method to give the working classes a leg up. You can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option**. The impulse is the same: The game is rigged and must be fixed. **But there’s a long gap between re-writing the rules of the game, as Warren wants, and turning over all the chess pieces, as Sanders does.**",t3_ab8bqc,democrats

"So, while I love the enthusiasm, you do know that that’s not how any of this works, right? But those idiots have to realize that the upcoming Dem majority House can do what Mr. Mueller cannot : To charge Trump with ‘Obstruction of Justice’. First, Mueller can charge people with Obstruction of Justice. In fact, he has already done that with Manafort and Kilimnik. Second, Congress actually cannot bring criminal charges against someone (the closest they can come is to hold someone in contempt of congress, though if you want to get real technical about it they’re really certifying a contempt citation and referring it to the DoJ). Trump and his lawyers can be sure that our new Dem House members will definitely start the impeachment proceedings after Jan. 3rd, 2019 with the latest revelations from Mr. Mueller in their hands. Just to make sure we’re clear, the only possible punishments that can come from impeachment proceedings are removal from office, being barred from holding later office, and loss of rights of certain post-office emoluments (ie losing the right to the Presidential Pension). No criminal penalties can come from it. Now the question that comes to the minds of all the legal scholars is, “Is this act by Trump an impeachable offence ? Not really. Impeachment is a political process not a legal one. As Gerald Ford aptly put it, “An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” ",t3_a57763,democrats

NO, Republicans are NOT OK with Trump meeting privately with Putin; they want Trump to recognize that Putin is NOT a US ally, but instead is a tyrant. Republicans want Trump to stand up to Putin, NOT submit to him as he has been doing. ''The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,' House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said after a joint press conference between the two leaders. 'There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,'he said. A growing number of Republican lawmakers focused on Trump’s remarks that both the U.S. and Russia were to blame for troubled relations between the two countries. Trump, responding to a question about whether Russia had any responsibility for that relationship, indicated that the ongoing investigation into the 2016 election was as much to blame as the Russian interference itself. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described the meeting in Helsinki as a 'tragic mistake.' “No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant,“ said McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin.'

I keep hoping that the allegedly-neutral Murdoch sons will turn Fox into a *real news* network. No evidence of that happening so far, AFAIK. Democrats will always be at a disadvantage, though, because we are less comfortable with outright lies. Climate change kills 32 with Hurricane Mildred!!!

The best way to do that is to showcase Lizzie Fletcher and other centrist Democrats to show the undecided educated urban voters out there that there is room for them in the Dem party. Lizzie Fletcher is coming to Congress by winning the seat George H. W. Bush once held. *Even if* she might not be as liberal as I'd like - (And who knows? She hasn't even cast a single vote in Congress yet) - she supports measures against gun violence, supports LGBT rights, expanding infrastructure, expanding voting rights, and other measures I'm on board with. She's hell of a lot better than the man she's replacing and I hope she serves the people of her district well. If generational Democrats in West Virginia and Kentucky make the switch to the Republican Party, we need to be able to convince generational Republicans in places like TX-7 that they can find a home with us, just as Lizzie Fletcher has done.

But practically, nothing could be done because of the current Senate. And enforcing a congressional determination under the Guarantee Clause probably requires the President's assistance. Federal court judgments are, for better or worse, a more realistic way of seeing some change. With respect to gerrymandering specifically, unfortunately there's still no ruling from the Supreme Court on whether partisan gerrymandering violates the U.S. Constitution (the case that went up but was kicked down on technical grounds, *Gill v. Whitford*, was a Wisconsin case). But we've already seen at least one state supreme court (Pennsylvania) hold partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional under the state's constitution.

In major public speeches, he has always seemed too polished and poll-tested, too much like Hillary in that respect... like someone who's been running for POTUS since the age of 5. While I don't want a candidate who's a blowhard or a gaffe factory, I think it's extremely important that we have someone who always seems like he's saying what he really thinks and not some carefully crafted talking point. That authenticity is intangible. Obama had it. Beto has it. Hillary didn't. Booker never seemed to have it when I watched his speeches or interviews in the past, but I haven't watched very many, and this story makes me reconsider him. Did I misjudge him, or is this just the kind of thing we see when an inauthentic candidate is tailoring his message to a moment that demands authenticity?

If hes impeached, mike pence is everything the GOP base wants: he is peo life/pro 2nd amendment/pro states rights/pro religious liberty. Hes clearly on board with almost all of the policies of the trump administration but is smart enough to keep his mouth shut. Trump not being able to shut up is what gives us 75% of the ammo against him. Pence is much smarter of a politician then trump and as such would probably ease the nerves of the GOP folk that may vote 3rd party to rebuke trump or would otherwise obstain. Plus, if trump is impeached i dont have enough faith yet that our voter base will turn out in droves to elect a dem.

Bernie appeals to young voters, and he has taken a clear position against corporate influence in politics.

"I think the fact she's able to stay out of the fray but still make a name for herself has worked in her favor. The Kavanaugh hearings did wonders whereas Sens Harris and Booker came off as grandstanding and invited confrontation, Klobuchar was more calming and easily got the better of Kavanaugh. Now it's a question what would happen if Trump went after her how everyone would react. For all his faults, Kavanaugh, or his handlers, were able to tell how badly he came off and cared about that enough to apologize. I'm 100% sure Trump feels no shame so it will be interesting to see how low he can go and how low his female followers will follow him. Another appeal is there is a certain fear that the Democrats are nominating a coastal politician again when our last two Dem POTUS' came from non-coastal states. She also has a natural appeal to all working class voters which is why her numbers rose in Iowa.

The elderly in Japan feel like they are 'useless' and, due to the communal and productive nature of Japanese culture, feel like they are a waste of space. This leads to Japan having one of the highest elderly suicide rates in the world. Moreover, if someone feels healthy enough and **is actually capable** of performing tasks, let them do so. People are more than tools to be used by a political apparatus. This type of political machine that some Democrats like to play is what resulted in Sanders being pushed aside for Clinton.

The Democrats are, technically, the ones keeping the government from remaining open. The Republicans (as you noted) got the votes in the House, Trump will sign it, and the only thing missing is the Senate, where Republicans will probably stay in line (save for maybe Flake). This gives Republicans over 50 votes for it in the Senate. So, the only thing keeping the government closed is about 10 Democrat Senators. Even then, if the “nuclear option” is invoked, Republicans might even be able to muscle it past the Democrats in the Senate anyway. Since the Democrats in Congress didn’t bat an eye at huge spending proposals by the Obama Administration (totaling in the trillions), it looks really petty for Democrats to vote no on a $5 billion increase, which is honestly a drop in the bucket at this point. This is compounded by Democrats being the party of “big spending” compared to “small government” Republicans.

Perhaps younger Democrats want a ticket like yours but there's still a large swath of older Democratic voters to consider and historically speaking they're the ones more likely to do the voting. 2018 had great turnout for the younger half of the voting electorate but there's no indication that'll continue.

I think that Pence is a much better politician than Trump is (just not a salesman/showman) and after what everyone has been through with Trump, Republican voters are going to want nothing more than a milquetoast, establishment Republican evangelical running for office in 2020. That, plus the fact that he would already have his ass prints on the desk chair in the oval office gives him a huge leg up in visibility and the ability to prove himself. Also, the Republicans in Congress--after totally putting their asses on the line with their base by impeaching Trump--are going to do everything in their power to promote Pence as the savior of The Conservative Way post-Trump. They will be campaigning hard for Pence and doing everything possible to make sure that he has a successful tenure as President. The independent voters who were Republican leaning but wouldn't vote for Trump will suddenly have Pence for an option. He will be playing hard for their votes during the year he has in office, so don't expect any crazy Conservative/Evangelical efforts during that time.

"First off, mass shootings are not the biggest problem we have. Violence, and gun violence in particular has been on the decline for decades. Suicide by firearm is the biggest cause of death by firearm in America, and those people would sadly turn to other methods. The biggest issue more than likely is that mass shootings get good TV ratings, so the media runs with them. Don't for a second think that ANY news outlet is your friend that is keeping you informed out of the kindness of their own hearts. They want us glued to the screen so they can reap that sweet advertising revenue. Mentally unstable folks see the intense amount of coverage and they copycat. We've had a ton of guns in this country for over 200 years. Why did mass shootings not become a thing until the universality of cable TV and the internet allowed the media to stream into every bit of our lives 24/7? It's not a coincidence. Give these people a short blurb in the local news and I'm guessing we'd see a decline. And why is America NOT the only country awash in guns, but the site of most of these shootings?

Juanita swears it happened, but I don't know what was in Hillary's heart in that moment. I have to say, I do find some of the talk of Hillary 'railroading' the women Bill had relations with (or assaulted...) to be a bit overstated, given her incredibly awkward position at the time. Publicly, she still seems to struggles with understanding how bad it was, but part of that is because... she's hamstrung since it's between that and throwing her own husband under the bus. Maybe she still doesn't even believe the worst of the allegations. Yeah, a lot of liberals give Bill Clinton a pass. Sometimes they won't come right out and say it because of how blatantly hypocritical it would seem, but they do. Bound to happen in our very tribal culture today. It's debatable how much blame the people around Bill deserve, but if we apply the standard to Clinton and Kavanaugh... I would say Bill is as bad or worse. And to my mind, the impact of his combined presidency/post-presidency has been one of the worst of any Democrat in semi-modern American history.

"Let's look at the actual filings to see this. **“The defendant’s false statements obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government. If the project was completed, the Company could have received hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues. The fact that Cohen continued to work on the project and discuss it with Individual 1 [aka Donald Trump] well into the campaign was material to the ongoing congressional and SCO investigations, particularly because it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.** Similarly, it was material that Cohen, during the campaign, had a substantive telephone call about the project with an assistant to the press secretary for the President of Russia.” **Legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin phrased it slightly differently in the wake of Cohen’s plea agreement: “It would have been highly relevant to the public to learn that Trump was negotiating a business deal with Russia at the same time that he was proposing to change American policy toward that country.”** “Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments. **In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1 [Donald Trump].**” Cohen’s commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for President of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency. **While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows. He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1.** **In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.** It is this type of harm that Congress sought to prevent when it imposed limits on individual contributions to candidates. To promote transparency and prevent wealthy individuals like Cohen from circumventing these limits, Congress prohibited individuals from making expenditures on behalf of and coordinated with candidates. Cohen clouded a process that Congress has painstakingly sought to keep transparent. **The sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of Cohen’s brazen violations of the election laws and attempt to counter the public cynicism that may arise when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful.** ",t3_a47gff,democrats

"This is why democrats are looked at with disdain. **Misinformation or outright bullshit makes you look weak and petty.** I totally agree. Let’s review the timeline shall we? On December 19th the Senate **unanimously passed** their second continuing resolution (since Trump had already flip-flopped on the first), the *Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 695)*, funding the government through February 8, 2019. That same day Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support such a measure, meaning it would pass the House even in the wake of opposition from conservative Republicans. After increasing criticism from conservative media, pundits and political figures, Trump reversed his position again and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding. **The House then passed a version of the continuing resolution on December 20 that added $5 billion for the wall** and $8 billion in disaster aid. However, negotiations in the Senate did not lead to agreement on passage of a continuing resolution that day. Trump's changing position had cause conflict among Senate Republicans who worried that Trump would once again flip-flop in them. When asked by reporters what the way forward was, retiring Tennessee Senator Bob Corker laughed: 'I don't know. Y'all have fun. I'm getting ready to drive to Chattanooga... You can’t make this stuff up.' So the shutdown started December 22 and President Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C. So congress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress. But, in an attempt at coming to a resolution in the last days of the lame duck session, the Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Republican Senator Pat Roberts presiding over the session. The House briefly reconvened as well, with Republican Majority Whip Steve Scalise saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018. Democrats sent Congressman Jim McGovern to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown **that the Senate had already passed, but Republicans refused to let him speak**. In every possible way the shutdown is directly the fault of Trump and the Republicans. This is why republicans are seen as disingenuous, feckless fucks. **The constant misinformation and outright bullshit makes them look like disingenuous, feckless fucks.**",t3_ab0fu8,democrats

"You're referring to the 'Socialism' of Marxism, and not the political philosophy that AOC is referring to. In Marx's 'materialist conception of history', it is believed that there are pure economic states that transition from one to the next via revolution (side note: this is a fundamental basis of Marxism, which has been since proven to be completely fictional by both historians and anthropologists). The name that Marx appropriated for one of these hypothetical states was 'Socialism', but the Marxist economic state called 'Socialism' is not to be confused with the actual political theory of socialism, which precedes Marx by more than half a century. In fact, the hypothetical economic state called 'Socialism' has almost nothing to do with the political philosophy of socialism, and to distinguish between the two, Marx and his adherents overwhelmingly refer to the political philosophy embodied through this hypothetical state not as 'socialism' but as 'Lower Communism.'",t3_a7ddso,democrats

Printing money divides the total wealth into smaller portions. Think of the entire GDP as a pie. Printing money does not create more pies, only divides the pie into more slices. That's why it's value is decreased when dollars are printed at the scale you're talking about. Now, instead of each dollar representing a quarter pie slice, it would represent a sixth. If before the notes were printed it cost 1 slice of pie to build a bridge, now it would cost 1 and a half.

I love the idea of universal healthcare, but to accomplish it, the government would have to tax up to 80% of people’s income like they do in other countries who try to finance that concept, and that is just unacceptable to me. I think it would kill the economy and slow down production to a crawl. In addition, I have an issue with the ethics involved with essentially extorting the great majority of what a person earns to arbitrarily support a cause they may or may not support and may or may not even benefit from. That being said, I do believe that sickness and disease are a major pestilence in society right now, and that the world will be in a much better place when we figure out how to beat it, which we will. It wasn’t too long ago that food was an expensive, often unaffordable, commodity, and today there’s so much food that almost a third of it goes to waste.

"I think democrats really shot ourselves in the foot last election cycle because too many voted for who we thought 'had the best chance,' not who we actually wanted to win. I don't think any sane person considered Hillary to be really high on electability. There was some concern Bernie would be even less electable given his embrace of the 'socialist' label and the stigma attached to it among people who don't understand that 'democrat socialism' is different. But 2016 was unique in its lack of charismatic candidates with relatively little baggage. The problem with the moderates we've nominated in the past and lost (Gore, Kerry, Clinton) is not that they weren't liberal enough; it's that they were too milquetoast, boring, and wonky (and Clinton had other baggage besides). We win with candidates who really get people excited and inspired, not by the details or ideological alignment of their policy plans but by the force of their personality. I think it's also very important that candidates have a good mind for policy and be right on the issues, and the temperament to handle difficult decisions and setbacks well, and other things... but if we can find those in a candidate that really connects with and inspires people across the political spectrum, then that's a winning combination.

This is why the GOP impeachment of Clinton failed to reach the point of conviction, because it was based on nothing more than partisanship, not on any genuine interest in the welfare of the country. My instincts are that Democrats are waiting for the Mueller Report to be released, which will give them everything they will need to impeach (besides what information is already publicly available). They need evidence strong enough that at least 10 or so Senate Republicans can be convinced to convict Trump on at least one of the charges.

I like Stacey Abrams as a champion of Black Americans and at the same time a business-friendly moderate who can reach across the aisle.

First of all, what do you exactly see as 'Bernie's base'? And second of all, where are you getting these numbers from? I'd love to see them.

So again, I question this 'highest floor of support' you're trying to push for Bernie. If you can give me the demographics of this 'base' that's supposedly propelling Bernie, please do. The way I see it, Bernie has a far left base of support but that isn't the highest floor of support. He doesn't have minorities or more importantly, women and african american women. THESE are the biggest demographics active in politics right now. These are the demographics that won the house. If you break it down the way you are about polling then it's a convenient argument for Bernie it ignores the reality... that he simply isn't the most popular figure around and the way other potential candidates like Harris, Booker and Beto are gaining ground proves that. If Bernie had the support of the base locked down then we wouldn't be having this conversation. But he doesn't. He has far left progressives locked down and that's not a sure thing.

"Trump is in a rush to get his policies through now that he knows what he’s facing next year. Not because he believes his policies are necessarily better for us, it’s because he’s desperate to get all that he campaigned on completed. He’s terrified of being seen as a failure. He’s wants to just “get it done” and claim himself as the most successful president in American history before 2020, or even sooner in case of impeachment. This is about Trumps ego, that’s it. It’s not even his agenda or policies, that’s just banter for his constituents. The wall isn’t about A wall as much as what it stands for. Compromise on the wall would mean him backing down to Democrats and weakening the message. So he will hold government employees hostage for a wall with Mexico, until the democrats cave from their constituents crying “uncle!” and he will spontaneously pull all troops out of Iran and Afghanistan simply because that’s what he said he’d do. He’s not thinking it through, he doesn’t care, any repercussions on his actions he will blame Democrats in the house for. It’s amazing, there were so many good Republicans. So many good military leaders and although I don’t often agree on the agenda, I’ve always respected them as their was supposed to be a mutual cycle of decency and respect and even those in Trumps Party are calling Trump out on lying and being indecent. What’s disturbing is that now, politics from the right, Trump politics, sets a disturbing new trend of lies, deceit, simple theatric stimulation, partisanship, an attitude of “all or nothing”, an attitude of indifference, celebrating ignorance, and general division and hate are now prominent and part of the political agenda.

I just saw the Iowa polling numbers and what the actual fuck is going on with these candidates. They aren’t running the candidates who will actually get them a win. IMO I think that any combo of POTUS/VPOTUS of Sanders, Ojeda, Beto or Yang could probably wipe out Trump. lol one of these is not like the others. who the hell knows about yang who isn't a total politics junkie like you and me? or even ojeda for that matter? >Any other candidate is going to lose and that’s the bottom line, evidence???? >Dems needs candidates who appeals to people and the one’s I listed are pretty well liked. apparently 'people' are all hardcore left-populists? (or single issue UBI technocrats? still don't get yangs inclusion there) >I need no explanation for Sanders, I think we all know about Sanders at this point a lot of people don't want the government expanded as far as sanders does, including within the party. and he also kinda sucks on race and immigration issues compared to other democrats >Ojeda is a people’s man and he can appeal to both sides with his vet experience. e is very much a champion of the people. The fact that he wasn’t on the ticket at Iowa was a fucking retarded move, people to need to find out about him because he is a strong candidate he voted for trump, and is against him now not bc ojedas views changed but bc trump didn't deliver on all his promises. he put rent seeking for dead rust belt industries above the basic rights and welfare of so many people. fuck ojeda. >Beto is a good politician but I don’t think he should be running for president right now, he needs to get a little more experience but ojeda and yang don't? he's been in elected office since '05, the other two have 2 years between them >Yang doesn’t have experience with politics but he is making an effort to become more educated in it oh well good for him guess we dont gotta worry about it >on top of that he is building traction going to multiple democratic conventions and is already campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire. so the hell what >but the democratic party to needs to get it’s fucking shit together and realize what it’s got before they fuck shit up again like when they had a massive boner for shit for brains Clinton, and look what that got them. Dems need someone strong, like no one gives a flying fuck about Booker, Bloomberg, etc. we'll see if that's true in the primaries, Booker was popular after sandy and has kind of a hyper positive m.o. that seems fake to me but could appeal to some people. bloomberg is just too niche, lefties hate him and libertarians and conservatives think hes a nanny state guy. plus he backed stop and frisk in NY which sucks. bottom line is you seem like one of those people who thinks that everyone is secretly a socialist and the people who vote against socialists are just wads of corporate cash who grew legs and started walking around, (i sorta felt like that in high school, i'm in college now) but it's just not how the world works.

"No, we ignore these things at our peril. It doesn't matter if feminists think it's inappropriate, because it's a real psychological effect that's going to influence whether we win the election or get four more years of Trump. Beating Trump is a lot more important than avoiding tropes. Also, it's only arguably even a mild form of sexism, and even if so, it's more a commentary on sexism in the electorate than on my part. Many women are incredibly powerful and effective public speakers. I've seen this in politics as well as personally as a scientist seeing women speak at conferences and universities. Michelle Obama is an obvious example of an incredible speaker who doesn't leave anyone with that 'principal's office' feeling. The most inspiring and effective speaker I've seen in my life was Mae Jemison, the first black female astronaut. TED talks are full of great female speakers. However, what these extremely effective female speakers have in common is a conversational tone. They sound like they're speaking in their natural voice. They don't speak in 'politician-voice,' a kind of loud, monotonous speech with an unnatural cadence that feels like an attempt to imitate the soaring rhetoric of great Presidential soundbites of the past, like JFK saying, 'We choose to go to the moon and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard.' However, *very* few speakers can actually pull that off, and even those can only do it after building up to it. Only Barack Obama was good at it in recent history, but he was good at sounding conversational much of the time and building up to those powerful moments. The vast majority of both men and women get stuck sounding like they're trying to infuse fake passion into mundane material, and they come off sounding boring, insincere, and like they're lecturing (just based on the sound of their voice, ignoring substance). This was true of both Al Gore and John Kerry, but also Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. If there is a bit of sexism here, it's that for some reason it's more grating to hear women speak in this poor style than men, perhaps because men have been doing it for so long that we're more desensitized to it, or perhaps because it's farther from the normal way women speak. However, it's *not* sexist to say that I don't want a candidate of either sex who speaks in this poor, generic political style. It is a problem on their part, whether men or women, even if there's some unfairness that makes it a bigger problem for women than it is for men. I prefer a candidate who avoids this problem altogether, and that's just as possible for women as it is for men. Of the female 2020 prospects, Kamala Harris is pretty good at this, and you probably won't see her getting the same criticism as Warren and Clinton. That has to tell you it's not all about sexism.",t3_ab75hd,democrats

We need someone with some charm (like Beto) or folksiness (like Bullock), or some other endearing quirk like Bernie's frazzle-haired lovable grandpa vibe. Somehow, listening to Warren feels a little bit like getting sent to the principal's office, even though I overwhelmingly like what she's saying and admire her work and her fighting spirit. If I could simply hand-pick and install a POTUS personally, I would probably select Warren.

Many progressives are unapologetic in our desire to have Medicare for All (should be a party centerpiece and would revolutionize healthcare in this country), a living wage, fully tuition-free public college, protecting and expanding on the progress we've made on social issues, massive federal infrastructure program/'Green New Deal', way less overseas intervention, the legalization/taxation/regulation of at least marijuana, ending the disgusting war on drugs immediately, getting real criminal justice reform, and just as importantly as all of that... getting corporate money the fuck out of politics, and passing REAL and LASTING campaign finance reform. Many moderates would say that's all pie in the sky, progressives are not pragmatic, that incremental change is both better and more attainable. Some may argue that those on the far left do tend to let perfect be the enemy of the good. But for the most part, I find myself agreeing with moderates on the end goals.

"Most of this is Alleged... and still being investigated by numerous people including the FBI. &#x200B; 1. The 2016 Presidential Election was messed with by the Russian Govt . All Federal Agencies agree with this. Trump does not. Most evidence suggest that the Russian Govt wanted Trump as president. Whether Trump campaign 'colluded' with Russian Govt and why is being investigated. 2. Trump is kind of in trouble for (allegedly) Lying about two major things during the Campaign for president. That he had no ties to Russia in any way. And that he never had sex with a Playboy bunny and Porn Star. Evidence suggest that he was trying to build one of his super buildings in Moscow, even after he was the Primary candidate. Evidence suggests that he not only did have sex with a porn star and the playboy bunny... but, also paid them off in a secret way that violates campaign laws. 3. Trump, Trump associates, and even Trump family members are caught up in a Saudi Arabian mess. The new guy in charge of Saudi Arabia allegedly had a reporter (who worked for the Washington Post) brutally murdered in the Saudi Consulate building. The CIA, NSA, and most (major spy networks) 'Know he did it', but Trump and associates are downplaying it and 'believe he didn't do it'. 4. Trump may or may not have committed repeated 'obstruction of justice'. This is currently being investigated. But, Trump (allegedly) keeps obstructing the investigation. 5. the Democratic party recently took control of the House of reps. A lot of people voted. This could mean that Democrats will push for impeachment. Left: the dude is a crook, of course impeach him. the Right: its messed up that you want to impeach him for NO REASON.. just cuz you don't like it. &#x200B; The left wing american party believe Trump is compromised by the Russian and/or Saudi Arabian Government. (Theories and evidence vary). The right wing american party believe this is is just democrats mad that Hillary didnt win... (Theories and evidence vary). &#x200B; Then, there are the mini controversies: \-Trump keeps hiring (alleged) idiots and or (alleged) corrupt officials, who later quit or get ousted. This is good for business interests but, you know, corrupt. \-Trump starting locking up children and sending there families back to Mexico. A lot of people argue that this is fucked up.. kidnapping children and keeping them in jail, while others argue that they are illegals and its a deterrent. \-A 5000+ person caravan of immigrants are coming to the us/mexico border looking for asylum. Trump sent the US army to stop them. Immigration is a hotly debated topic right now. Trump has a zero tolerance stance. There is pros and cons... HOTLY debated topic. \-Trump has become Tariff Man. Trump says its good for business.. but others are feeling the pain. Framers and Car makers are getting hit hard. \- Trump is making it easier for companies to Pollute: Its good for business, but bad for the Environment and people. Climate change is a hotly debated topic. &#x200B; Thats just the stuff off of the top of my head. Keep in mind, I have boiled this down to very simple talking points. There is a lot of nuance to these topics which i have not the time to go into. At this moment, there is no 'proof' publicly \\ legally being shown of TRUMP doing bad things. There is an investigation, which will prove or disprove any wrongdoings. Although, again.... Trump keeps saying the investigation is a witch hunt that is distracting from him being able to perform his duties as a president. &#x200B; I am biased in my opinion.. but, i at least tried to argue what the other side is saying.

"No contradiction at all, as I see it. Currently, Joe Biden is polling higher than Bernie. But Bernie's core supporters are more solidly behind him then Biden's are, I think that's pretty clear. The grassroots progressive left is largely united behind him, which you sort of concede. It's not a giant number, but it's a definite soft 'floor' that could pay dividends in a race with so many candidates. Of course his numbers in a poll of many candidates won't be where they were when it was a 2-person race in 2016, but his support isn't likely to dip very much from where it is now, while I think it's fair to expect some of the more centrist candidates to dip much more into the Biden pool as their name recognition rises to match Joe/Bernie's. We won't know any of this for sure until the race, naturally. Polling data this far out is incomplete, but there will be a lot more candidates in the establishment lane than the 'far' left, more progressive lane.

If you are going to increase the age restrictions on semi-automatic rifles you are worried could be used in some shooting, then fine it's your store. But to specifically target the AR-15 is ridiculous and doesn't really solve the problem. Plus, the AR-15 has become the ultimate boogeyman and scapegoat of gun control advocates, which again is just frustrating. Also, they talk about mass shootings as though they are an epidemic in the US despite the reality that they account for an incredibly small amount of gun-related deaths and are incredibly rare. You are ridiculously more likely to get hit by lightning and die than to even be involved in a school shooting, and the statistics on mass shootings in general are dramatically exaggerated.

Is hiring Jared draining the swamp? Has he shown any fiscal responsibility? Is Sebastian Gorka one of the best and brightest? What did Mexico say? “No FOCKING WAY”. He’s let you down on every promise he made. But the worst is: 2. Trump is a traitor. His policies and actions have one and only one purpose: become an oligarch for Putin. He knows he has to keep Putin from publishing the pee pee video. You hated Hillary. I understand.

You know full well it was about seeking unfair advantages regarding the electoral college and how the rules were set in place before he began his run. He didn’t make the electoral college rule and then run. It was there and he won from it. But sure bend my words to make yourself sound smart. If Bernie or whomever you support won by the electoral college would he be unelected? No you’d say it’s the system get used to it. I THINK THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND SHOULD BE CHANGED. but I think it can be broken for both sides. This conversation is pointless because you’ve seen someone talk about George Orwell once and now you equate it to everything you see and you think it makes you look intelligent. Im actually a supporter of most of the subs you seem to frequent. I’d say I’m a liberal and I think Trump is colluding with the Russians and I hope to see him go to jail. Yet I’m suddenly a republican because I think that a President( that Iv already stated I would never vote for and would do everything in my power to oppose) is the President and now I have to constantly defend my entire political identity and convince you I’m not a republican shill hellbent on rewriting history? because I disagreed with the fact I think he was elected?! You have to be trolling. You can’t actually be this hysterical. You’re just constantly wanting to feel oppressed by everyone that opens their mouth and it’s embarrassing.

"Bernie over Biden is the easiest decision for me out of the entire Democratic field, because I believe Sanders is the strongest candidate (both in terms of policy, and defeating Trump) and Biden the weakest on policy. Look, they're both old white guys, we all know that. The short answer is Uncle Joe's too moderate for me. I don't like his views on virtually unfettered free trade, and neither will the election-deciding Rust Belt when more light is shone on that history. That alone leaves him VERY vulnerable to Trump and the right wing marketing machine. Sanders' message resonates perfectly there, and it's why he did so well there in the 2016 primaries, with the deck stacked against him. Biden doesn't even passively support Medicare for All, which is probably the closest thing I have to a litmus test in the Democratic primary. He may well be a stabilizing force in many respects, and I know a lot of people (including me) are yearning for that. But you don't prevent future Trumpism by effectively returning to the same status quo that gave him to us in the first place. We need real change. M4A is great for individuals, AND great for business. The profit motive has NO place in health insurance, so long as you can find ways to spur continued innovation in medicine. Tuition-free college is another agenda item that will radically help Americans, particularly low-income people who feel resigned not to be able to go to school from an early age, and check out mentally. We need less war, not more war. We need criminal justice reform that goes a lot farther than the establishment wants to take it. We need to get money out of politics and move to public funding of elections. We need to tackle climate change in big strokes, not in dribs and drabs. The list goes on, but mostly importantly we need to IGNITE the dormant millions in this country who are either uninterested or disenchanted with the political system, and the progressive agenda is the best way to do that and build a sustainable base for left-wing politics. So many more people would benefit from left-wing economic and social policy than right-wing, so it's about BRAZENLY marketing these very good ideas in a no-holds-barred way. ",t3_a78h00,democrats

Some people just don't want to deal with following the depressing nature of politics, and have no idea what a con job Trump has pulled over on them.

"Democrats have weaponized the issues of gun control and sexual assault this year, and I feel this has backfired from both media saturation and having poor figureheads at the front of the movements. The ~35% of democrats that own a gun see what happened in Washington state, where they passed a law defining any semiautomatic rifle as an assault weapon, and are pushed away from the party as a result. It would suck to own a defensive rifle, not even an AR-15, for your home protection then be told it’s an assault weapon. Then, in future sessions they will try again as they already have to ban the sale of assault weapons, which now effectively just means rifles at this point. After that, it’s illegal to sell your legally purchased property. All this effort to stop the handful of deaths that will be caused by rifles in Washington annually is a lot of political capital to spend on little return. Having me too cases like Ansari and Tyson getting accused over bad dates and poor social skills sunk the movement that might have otherwise taken down a Supreme Court nominee. Democrats weaponize issues, just not very well. ",t3_a3bsyg,democrats
"I can understand why you feel that way, but I do see it slightly differently. Sure, if we look at his top stump speech items that he's become known for, many of them are economics-focused. Like I get it, he has said things to the effect of 'we need to address the bigotry in this country, and equally as importantly, or even more importantly, we need to focus on the issues impacting everyday Americans'. Truly, I can understand how someone might read that and be like 'really, MORE importantly? Bad choice of words, Bernout'. And the comment he made which sort of shifted some of the racial blame off of voters and onto the candidates was a bad idea, however well-intentioned it may have been. His gaffes have been massively overstated, but that was an example of one I can understand criticizing. But I don't think it's all that fair to extrapolate Bernie's focus on the working class into meaning the 'white' working class. He tries to appeal to the working class at large, and seems focused on making it clear that people of all races have more in common with each other than they may think. And I'm sure part of that does include him wanting to bring more of the white working class back towards the left too, as statistically they vote against their own best interests more than perhaps any other demographic group. I believe much of what Sanders aims to do is to get people to stop looking at each other with contempt, but to re-direct that fury at a system that has screwed so many Americans over. Agreeing or disagreeing with that is one thing, but I genuinely don't feel like he views social issues as any less important than others in the prospective field. No doubt, rhetorically he tries to bring a different set of issues to the forefront of the conversation, but what do you think he should've strived to do more of, that could've made you more supportive of him? Policy-wise, he's in the right place on virtually every social issue, so I presume it's more about a belief that he's been a bit dismissive? Having paid plenty of attention to Bernie over the last few years, I don't quite agree with you, but like I said I can respect where you're coming from on that.",t3_a778mh,democrats

"And so the trashing of Democratic candidates begins. The Conservatives know that the only chance they have of keeping the Presidency is to create the division among Democrats that cost us The Presidency. It's a form of voter suppression that was used by Conservative groups and Russian Trolls alike. We will see a lot of it in the upcoming election so we should probably be prepared. Posts that seem to be from liberal groups or individuals will turn up to be written in Russian or Conservative troll farms. Anyone who tells you that you shouldn't vote for any reason is directly trying to suppress your vote. Anyone who is constantly trashing a Democratic candidate and not offering an alternative should be suspect. Anyone sowing division, hatred, and chaos among the different branches of the Democratic party are the enemy of the Democratic party, no matter the side they profess to belong to. Those calling for a moderate candidate to encourage national unity are either ignoring the current political climate or trying to discourage support from the far left wing of the party. There will be plenty of candidates to choose from and there will likely be a few that you do not like as much as the others, but always remember that ANY of them will be better than Trump. Another Trump presidency means at least one if not more appointments to The Supreme Court. Through voter suppression and gerrymandering, the Conservatives have been gaining ground and winning in areas that they would not be able to win if the elections were fair. Roe Vs. Wade has never been in more danger of being overturned. This only scratches the surface of the damage that will be done if we lose the next election. With the likelihood of continued foreign interference, voter suppression, gerrymandering, propaganda and disinformation campaigns we are up against means the fight will already be uphill.

They were able to take advantage of racist white resentment of the civil rights revolution but Dems didn’t do ourselves any favors plunging the country into the catastrophe of the war in Vietnam. When people are getting drafted that has a huge impact. Even with all that Nixon barely won that election in ‘68. For the most part, I think the system’s working better than we care to admit. The Republicans just lost 40 seats in the House in response to their fiscal irresponsibility and refusal to perform oversight of the president. We’ll have another election in two years.

"Since forever. 'The Other' has been a memetic of human sociology for as long as clans identified themselves w territory. Zoologist Desmond Morris wrote about this in 'The Naked Ape'. Ancient People took pains to differentiate between the Self and The Other. Tribal markings and modes of dress gave way to the Sigel and thence to flag. In all cases, from prehistoric clans to postmodern Nationalism an elite class maintained control of assets which generated a false scarcity that helped to bind the Tribe into a self-interested in preservation. The ancient Clan leader kept meat hidden in the Clan's permafrost freezer ensuring abundance for his family and a few warriors who enforced the leader's rule. By fostering dependency on the leadership of the Clan elite, as long as the leader controlled assets, there developed a kind of stability and security among the Clan members. Anything that threatened to upset the Social equilibrium of the Clan was anathema to the leadership and the elite. Fast forward to the EuroAmerican concept of 'The Social Contract' (Rousseau) and 'The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution' (David Brion Davis). For the first time in history, human society began to consciously examine the ancient memetic of 'The Other' as the unanticipated consequence of the slave trade was to introduce new and different occupants into the economic base of the Clan, so to speak. Meanwhile the Renaissance and the reformation challenged traditional notions of the Elite. The rise of the Middle-Class and the collective economic power of the merchant class along with mass literacy and the rise of mass media (Printing Press) forced the American society to confront this notion of The Other. And a civil war ensued '...testing whether this Nation or any Nation so conceived and so dedicated could long endure...' From the moment Lincoln emancipated the slave Race until the passage of the Civil Rights Act a terrible churning and conflict continued. The Racism inherent in the Other refused to die. But AFTER Lincoln and AFTER the CRA, Racism was made de jure and as a matter of public morality unacceptable. Which finally brings me to your question about the message on the hat: 'Make America Great Again' is code for racists to litigate the Civil War.The hat in the picture says 'Fuck That Nonsense; We've Come Too Far To Go Back!'

"How to stop mass shootings? It depends which kind you're talking about. Those that promote gun control as a solution have done a disservice to the whole conversation by lumping different types of shootings together under the umbrella of 'mass shooting'. Twisting the definition from multiple unrelated people killed to simply 3 or more wounded has blended together very disparate problems. Now every gang shooting is being lumped together with psychos like the Pulse club or Vegas, which harms productive conversation. Now, how to stop them? &#x200B; I think stop is the wrong word here, and reduce should be used because it would be neigh impossible to completely stop them. The solution to stopping 80% of mass shootings is simple, because the vast majority are drug and crime related with poor urban young adults and children killing other poor urban young adults and children. Give universal healthcare, quality education, nutrition assistance, economic opportunity, stop the war on drugs, end the mass incarceration of the black population, and provide a sense of hope to a community that has been stepped on for 500 years. This will solve 80% of mass shootings, without making a damn thing illegal or changing gun laws. As for the psycho 20% that shoot up schools and clubs, that's a harder egg to crack because the causes are disjointed or often never revealed. We've seen links to depression and bullying, so supporting universal mental healthcare seems an appropriate place to start. I find red flag laws to be a violation of the 4th Amendment, but the concept is ripe. The underlying idea is to have cops do their actual job and investigate people that are potential threats, a lapse that could have otherwise prevented Parkland. And when we can't prevent a psycho, stop making them celebrities and using their kill counts like a video game score board. We can very much reduce mass shootings, but like Australia found out you can't just legislate them out of existence with things like California's features test for an assault weapon or magazine capacity limits. The worst school shooting in the US used a .22 pistol as one of the main weapons, which would have a hard time killing a dog. The size of the bullet tends not to matter though when the victim is incapable of defending themselves, trapped in a room. ",t3_a3cv77,democrats

"copy/pasta of all tweets for easier reading: Everyone has some area of expertise. Mine is in corporate crime. I reported about it for 20 years at NY Times, wrote all or parts of 4 books about it, give lectures at biz schools and major corporations about it. Which leads us to the Michael Cohen sentencing memo.... Many are ranting with little understanding of corporate crime, the law and the implications. They are mixing up one payment with another - or many others. They don't understand the magnitude of what is going on here. And that is because it is not their area of expertise. So, let's discuss this so that everyone can understand what the memo says happened, because it is jaw dropping. There are two payments at issue here - one of which for $460,000 was broken up into 12 payments. Let's call them P1 and P2, recognizing that P2 was broken up. The distinction between these two payments is absolutely critical. Trump himself has been implicated in P1 both by Cohen and in the sentencing memo. The Trump Organization...and officials there...have been implicated in P2 through the sentencing memo. Both P1 and P2 are as described, crimes. P1 is the one where Individual 1 is specifically implicated - that being Trump. That constitutes a campaign finance violation. However, this is a low level violation, and one that is open to interpretation depending on the specifics of what Cohen says. Trump could fight this one and, in the end, he might defeat it by simply saying 'Cohen told me this was out of his home equity, I considered it a favor, and did not have anything to do with my campaign.' Not so believable? Sure. But without specific designation of Trump's knowledge intent regarding that payment, he could easily argue technical violation based on poor information -or disagree that there was a violation at all by saying this was not about the campaign, but for, say, keeping Melania from finding out he had banged a porn star. Which leads us to P2 - the MAJOR crime, with the payments coming out of the Trump Organization.. The sentencing memo does not say that Trump was involved in P2. It doesn't say he wasn't. If he WAS, he belongs in jail. And prosecutors know if he was already one of the most interesting witnesses in all of this case was the CFO of the Trump Organization. When I saw he had been granted immunity in August, I thought: Financial crime. I assumed it was linked to info related to Cohen, but knew that was speculation. The CFO, Allen Weisselberg, would know everything about P2. Including if Trump's approval was sought for it. If so, Trump would definitely be implicated in not only of campaign finance violations through P1 and P2, but MORE important, would be implicated in conspiracy, money laundering, fraud AND campaign finance violations. To explain: In P1, Cohen sent money from his home equity line through a corporate shell ultimately to Stormy Daniels. The proof, without P2, that this was in violation of campaign finance laws is largely interpretive: was this considered a contribution from Cohen, and was it done purely for election purposes? The repayment was always the important issue. The potential illegality of the original payment was hard to prove without knowing about the repayment (P2). I figured given what Cohen said in court when he pleaded guilty, he had been reimbursed, but the question was down to who and how. It could have come from Trump, which would have made a campaign violation almost impossible to prove. Or it could have come from the Trump campaign which would have been a lock-down, undeniable campaign finance violation. It is much much much much worse than that. The payment - P2 - came from Donald Trump's company, the Trump Organization. And everything about how it was paid suggests - or shows - criminal activity. So, what do we know about P2? It was paid after submission of an invoice - a frigging INVOICE - from Cohen to Trump Org saying it was for campaign expenditures. It billed not only the $130,000 for the Stormy payoff, but also another $50,000 in IT work for the campaign the IT payment is the drop dead element. Given the supposed IT work was done for trump CAMPAIGN, paid for by the Trump ORGANIZATION, it shows that his company was issuing checks to cover campaign expenditures. This establishes the intent to commit the crime - that is, to use the Trump Organization as a slush fund for cash to the campaign. Think of it as being like the slush fund of Nixon in Watergate. Nixon WH shook down corporations for $ which was then under the control of campaign and white house officials. It was used to finance innumerable operations, including the break in. Here, the Trump Organization is the sole contributor to the slush fund. Now, making this all the worse is that the money flowed through multiple sources to disguise its ultimate source - from a HELOC to a bogus corporation to the recipient of the payment, reimbursed by a corporation to the owner of a HELOC, all in violation of campaign finance rules. That is money laundering - manipulating directions of cash used in a crime for the purpose of concealing its provenance. The more steps it takes, the more evidence of money laundering. Making it all the worse - they upped the amount to account for taxes, kicked in a $60,000 bonus. This is strong evidence of conspiracy to commit a crime. Think about it - how often does anyone get paid money with a roundup for taxes PLUS a bonus for what was done. And it was done for the campaign. Next, fraud: The Trump Organization has what are called covenants with its banks. The only bank in the world that is willing to lend these bozos money anymore is Deutschebank. As in the bank that was raided not too far back. If Deutsche KNEW of this crime, then it is part of the conspiracy. If it did not, then the Trump Organization engaged in fraud by violating its covenants with the bank (i.e.: Don't commit crimes) and failing to disclose if the Trump Org received ANY additional loans since 2016, and failed to disclose these activities, it will be an ongoing bank fraud. There may be tax issues, but hard to know yet. Back to the CFO: He is the key witness in all of this, potentially the key participant, BUT he was given immunity. And you don't get immunity if all you have to offer up is lower-level executives. Which brings us to the last piece: We do not know yet if Trump was involved in this. We also don't know that he wasn't. What we know is this happened - and that Trump was involved on the front end - P1. We will know, once the testimony of the CFO comes out, whether Trump was involved in P2, the back end. One fact I forgot: The $460,000 payment to Cohen (the stormy payoff, the fake IT work, the tax bump up and the $60,000 bonus) was paid in 12 broken up pieces to disguise it from being a pure reimbursement. Instead, it was portrayed as a consulting payment. This, again, is evidence not only of criminal intent, but of money laundering. So, P2 is the key to this. If Trump knew of P2, he belongs in jail, not just impeached and convicted. These are major financial crimes, far more than a campaign finance violation. Dont jump the gun. Dont proclaim his guilt or make up standards ('CEOs are responsible even if they don't know' or other nonsense) you can't go to jail for fraud - and money laundering that follows it - if you do not have the intent to commit fraud. There is no transitive property of financial fraud. So, if the CFO testified Trump knew...thats the end of his presidency. Or would be in a normal country.",t3_a4xdlr,democrats

"Right? I am a 38 year old gay man, who makes decent money, has healthcare, and owns his own home. I am doing ok, but I remember when I wasn't doing ok. I remember when it was really really hard to be an openly gay American. So I still vote and support the dems for all those people that AREN'T doing okay. Because I have walked in their shoes. But if those fuckers still want to vote in Republicans. If the Far Left of the party wants to shit on everything, vote for Jill Stein, or the 10% of them that voted for Trump because their widdle feelings were hurt??? Well....What can I do? Politics is largely a philosophical game for me now. I am going to be okay financially because I am in the top 5%. And I will be dead long before Climate Change makes the planet uninhabitable. So if idiots in Red America, and Idiots on the far left, want to continue to vote in Republicans...more power to them. I am sad that Obamacare is under attack again. Because I know a lot of people are going to suffer without it's protections. But I won't be suffering. You know who will be? Republican voters in rural America, and shitty Bern-outs who are about to get forced off their parents health plan if that protection is revoked due to this court case. And since those people are the ones that fought so hard to put Trump and Republicans in power...then so be it. I don't care if it's shitty of me. I am tired of it. Even now, as we ramp up into 2020..the same bad actors are back. 'Nancy Pelosi is too oldddddddddddddd!!!! Wah!!!!! We should vote for Jill Stein again comrades..i mean...fellow progressives!' I am not even mad at the trolls and russian bots anymore. I am mad at the people that still fall for the bullshit every..single...time. The top articles on Way of the Bern are all Uniformly 'The Democrats suck!' 'The russians aren't doing anything shady' 'Hillary Clinton is robbing people thru the Clinton foundation' and 'The MSM is fake news and the enemy of the American people!' I shit you not...the 'progressive' subs on Reddit are no different from reading Trumps twitter feed. The..exact..same...talking points.      The entire sub is a Pro-Russia, Pro-wikileaks, Anti-Dem, Pro-Trump cesspool. Much like it was in 2016 when it was encouraging people to vote for Trump to punish the Dems. And those 10% of Bernie voters tipped the scale in Pennsylvania and Michigan. And now they are ramping up and doing it again....and the same people are falling for it.

I was not that surprised about the Senate being this was a rather Republican friendly election map, in terms of what senate seats were open, and they still had heavy fights and a small pick up.

"That's interesting, my mistake...going to check. Second sentence wasm 'The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,' House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said after a joint press conference between the two leaders.' I see where McCain and Ryan both criticized the president for meetings with Russia. Then it appears several others did anonymously. As well as Mitch McConnell, and Trey Gowdy. I'll just post it here so you don't have to click on the link I provided: WASHINGTON — President Trump's unwillingness to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin during a joint appearance on Monday prompted a groundswell of criticism from Democrats and Republicans — including many longtime defenders of the president. 'The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,' House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said after a joint press conference between the two leaders. 'There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,'he said. A growing number of Republican lawmakers focused on Trump’s remarks that both the U.S. and Russia were to blame for troubled relations between the two countries. Trump, responding to a question about whether Russia had any responsibility for that relationship, indicated that the ongoing investigation into the 2016 election was as much to blame as the Russian interference itself. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described the meeting in Helsinki as a 'tragic mistake.' “No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant,“ said McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin.' The bipartisan blow back extended beyond the usual GOP critics of Trump, aligning Russia hawks with House conservatives and others who who have defended Trump in the past. Republican criticism continued to mount Monday as Trump flew back to Washington after more than a week in Europe. Aboard Air Force One, Trump posted on Twitter that he has 'GREAT confidence' in his intelligence officials but added that 'I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past.' Several Republicans offered more cautious reaction, or kept a relatively low profile. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said 'the Russians are not our friends' and said he 'entirely' believes the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow was involved in the election. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Trump lashed out at NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense and criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May in a bombshell interview in a London tabloid a day before their bilateral meeting. But it was the president's press conference with Russia that drew the most immediate and sharpest criticism from Capitol Hill. Trump, who said he raised Crimea and election meddling in his private meetings with Putin, declined to do so in public. “Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Our nation’s top intelligence agencies all agree on that point,' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee led a high-profile hearing last week delving into alleged anti-Trump bias at the FBI, said he is confident Trump’s aides will impress on him Russia’s involvement in the election. “Russia is not our friend,” Gowdy said, adding that he hoped White House officials would communicate to Trump that “it is possible to conclude Russia interfered with our election in 2016 without delegitimizing his electoral success.' Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., agreed. “I never thought I would see the day when our American president would stand on the stage with the Russian president and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression,” Flake, a frequent Trump critic, posted on Twitter. “This is shameful,” he added.",t3_a27rl7,democrats

"The world is more unstable now than if ISIS won the Syrian civil war and the US and Russia were headed for an inevitable confrontation? Let me get this straight - the US withdrawing from Syria is bad because Russia and Iran will fill the power vaccuum, but this will strengthen ISIS despite Russia being far more aggressive towards them than the US or it's allies have ever been? This pro-regime change rubbish is just covert warmongering. The Iraq war led to instability that has caused over 10m deaths. Libyan regime change led to (as I mentioned above) instability resulting in open air slave auctions. This is what you're arguing for, why would it be any different? Would you rather see Assad in control of Syria, or ISIS? Assad isn't a good guy, but a fully fledged Jihasist state literally enslaving the women of the country and murdering the apostates and non-believers would be worse, imho.

"I think that most people who identify as conservatives believe that poor people are poor for lack of effort, and that poor people who work hard can make what they want out of their life. I don't think that Republicans hate poor people, but I do think that they believe that people stay poor through their own inactivity and therefore should not be helped economically by people who have worked their way to a successful career. I also believe that a large number of Republicans feel that the family and/or religious establishments should provide a safety net against poverty. As a Democrat, I also believe that effort leads to success, but my fundamental belief is that our society (and civilization) will develop better if we maintain a certain national level of healthcare, education, and safety so that everyone, regardless of socio-economic background, has a government sponsored minimum acceptable safety-net and 'starting point' for building a career trajectory.",t3_a9toko,democrats

"In my opinion I don't think Trump wants money from Russia. Yeah the guy is an ass but he ran for president because he truly thought he could do a better job. He puts his ego and nationalist ideas first. He's not an active participant in Russia's plan but that doesn't mean he isn't complacent. I think Russia set up Trump as a puppet through making everyone complacent around him, thus making him complacent. Putin then confronted Trump (whole hotel fiasco) by detailing how he owns Trump and that any deviation. Trump's an easy target because one, his ego, and two, he has zero political ties which makes him vulnerable. I didn't vote for Trump, he goes off the handle too much and is not a politician, but, I don't believe that he willingly made this deal with russia since in his presidency he's hurt Russia the most",t3_a2kgta,democrats

"And I do not agree with much of what he says. I also do not agree with 'nuremburg like trials' for people that supported him. That is an utterly despicable thing to support and would only serve to drive one hell of a big wedge into an already cracked to shit political situation. At worst it would end up with some people in open rebellion of such an action. That is not acceptable in any society that supports freedom of speech and freedom of expression. If other presidents have been involved in such things then how would we know? We wouldnt. We might hear one or two things with some minor outrages every now and then but it could be relatively quiet and we would never be the wiser. The entire government is corrupt, not just one party and just because one orange haired idiot is receiving a disproportionate ammount of media attention should not distract you from that fact. The media is a difficult issue. On one hand we have large conglomorates controlled by very opinionated rich people on both sides who want to make sure their platforms spew only their take on the story and make money off the ensuing views and outrage from said coverage and on the other we have the need to respect free speech and freedom of the press. What can any of us do about that? Nothing. All we can do is promote peaceable conversation instead of this rabid tribalism that is plaguing our society.
