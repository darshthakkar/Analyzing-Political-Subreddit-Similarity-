"Well, do this math real quick to put it into perspective .... The mandatory budget is about 2.5 Trillion and represents the total social state we’ve built in the US. 4 million new Americans are born here every year and some percentage of them will be poor their entire lives, benefitting from that 2.5 Trillion in spending. Most Americans won’t benefit from it until they use Medicare at age 65. So every year we spend $625,000 per child born that year....on entitlements. If we spend that every year then it is accurate to state that the US government spends $625,000 per American providing entitlement services. If you were given $625,000 at birth in a blind trust invested into an index fund....with the earned interest dedicated to paying for things that the social state would have paid...you would be able to live your entire life with excellent healthcare and education and a thirty year career and retire as a multi millionaire. If we gave every single child born in America every year their $625,000 share.....in a couple generations every American would be a millionaire. Just a mental exercise, politicians would never allow it to happen. ",t3_aa43sc,neutralnews
"People often distinguish between a pay gap and a wage gap. As you've stated, this suggests the gender pay gap does exist (women earn less) but that the gender wage gap does not (women earn the same hourly rate for the same work with the same seniority, etc). The pay gap is often attributed to women working significantly fewer hours than men and choosing positions with lower hourly pay (regardless of gender).",t3_a4xhi6,neutralnews

"You have a good point. I work at a fortune 500 company and I know my wage is absolutely the same as any peer males. However, my lifetime total compensation will be less because women take longer maternity leaves and I have taken two. This cuts my bonus. Also part of it is disability paid at 60%. You may think it’s rad to get 22 weeks off work paid. That’s...subjective. Men take their paternity leave but will often come to work anyway so their promo trajectories are less affected. I also am trying to avoid pumping at work this time because it will kill my promo chances. So of what I have described there’s not a ton of choice because a man can’t carry the baby for the family. Theoretically I could have adopted but my benefit for that is only $15k which is a drop in the bucket. And I wanted to have my own.

"Why hold up the facade? Because 'They're family' “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, according to a recording of the June 15, 2016, exchange, which was listened to and verified by The Washington Post. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is a Californian Republican known in Congress as a fervent defender of Putin and Russia. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) immediately interjected, stopping the conversation from further exploring McCarthy’s assertion, and swore the Republicans present to secrecy. Before the conversation, McCarthy and Ryan had emerged from separate talks at the Capitol with Ukrainian Prime Minister Vladi­mir Groysman, who had described a Kremlin tactic of financing populist politicians to undercut Eastern European democratic institutions. News had just broken the day before in The Washington Post that Russian government hackers had penetrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee, prompting McCarthy to shift the conversation from Russian meddling in Europe to events closer to home. Some of the lawmakers laughed at McCarthy’s comment. Then McCarthy quickly added: “Swear to God.” Ryan instructed his Republican lieutenants to keep the conversation private, saying: “No leaks. . . . This is how we know we’re a real family here.”  Pretty clear that their loyalty starts and ends with their party, regardless of the American people.",t3_a6i5kk,neutralnews

"This article seems like total disingenuous garbage. It completely misrepresents the study that describes a 51% gap in earnings. Here is what the article says: >Rather than starting with an observation (that 80-cent statistic) and examining possible causes, Hartmann and Rose have **simply assumed a cause (rampant sexism)** and carried out a slightly grander version of the back-of-a-cigarette-box calculation to support it. This isn’t how social science research should be done. It is exactly the wrong way round And here is an excerpt from the  itself: Women are completing more years of education than men, but women’s and men’s major fields of postsecondary study differ substantially, and some women’s majors lead to lower pay (Carmichael 2017). More training and education are needed to help women enter and remain in traditionally male-dominated occupations, which often pay better. In addition, greater union representation and collective bargaining, along with higher minimum wages, tend to raise women’s wages more than men’s, narrowing the earnings gap (Shaw and Anderson 2018). >The remaining large differences in the years and hours worked between women and men suggest that ways to increase women’s full-time, yearround work and to encourage men to share more of the unpaid time spent on family care are also needed. Policies, such as paid family leave, available to and used by both men and women, would help, as would public subsidies for child care while parents work. Supports for workers who combine elder care with their own careers are also needed, since adults spend more working years with older parents on average than they do with young children. Such supports could include greater subsidies for paid care for the frail and ill elderly, paid family leave to help working caregivers, and improved retirement and Social Security benefits for those who reduce working time in order to provide child or elder care. >Some progress on tackling these issues has emerged in recent years, particularly at the state and local level. More rigorous standards of equal pay in six states that prevent employers from asking about past pay will hopefully spread across the United States or become superseded by national legislation, establishing a practice that will end the perpetuation of pay discrimination from one job to the next (National Women’s Law Center 2018). The study doesn't assume sexism at all, and in fact talks about specific issues related to the differences in income, none of which mention sexism.",t3_a4xhi6,neutralnews

There is no reproducible and statistically significant evidence showing a causal link between vaccines and autism, and even if there was, it would be an infinitesimal risk to pay in the face of the scale of suffering and death that infectious disease ravages us with. I was just trying to clarify the broken math behind the studies that claim to show this causal link, because there are some of those out there. There are also a number of studies showing correlations whose intent is not to link vaccines and detrimental effects like autism, but instead to provide more data to improve computational models. Someone who is uneducated might see that data set and say, “oh shit look at all these people who got vaccinated and then developed autism”, but really the study is about reducing uncertainties in other computations.",t3_a3d9x5,neutralnews

"Got curious about where the anti-vax movement actually got started and found this little gem:  >In 1998, British doctor Andrew Wakefield recommended further investigation of a possible relationship between bowel disease, autism, and the MMR vaccine.[14] A few years later, Wakefield alleged the vaccine was not properly tested before being put into use.[15] The media seized these stories, igniting public fear and confusion over the safety of the vaccine.[16] The Lancet, the journal that originally published Wakefield’s work, stated in 2004 that it should not have published the paper.[17] The General Medical Council, an independent regulator for doctors in the UK, found that Wakefield had a “fatal conflict of interest.” He had been paid by a law board to find out if there was evidence to support a litigation case by parents who believed that the vaccine had harmed their children. In 2010, the Lancet formally retracted the paper after the British General Medical Council ruled against Wakefield in several areas. Wakefield was struck from the medical register in Great Britain and may no longer practice medicine there. In January 2011, the BMJ published a series of reports by journalist Brian Deer outlining evidence that Wakefield had committed scientific fraud by falsifying data and also that Wakefield hoped to financially profit from his investigations in several ways.[18] I know Jenny McCarthy is kind of the face of the current anti-vax movement but how did it get to Italy? I had always assumed this was kind of an American centric thing but obviously it's affecting Italy as well. Real question: Is there any ACTUAL evidence of vaccines causing autism or other major negative effects?

">First, I feel like she's adopting Trumpian tactics, constantly bombarding the news with terse statements about how everything's wrong with everything to perpetuate a crisis atmosphere, and I'm fucking sick of those tactics. Unlike Trumps sabre rattling and scare tactics (For example the horrifying immigration caravan invading the US!). She comments on actual problems that affect how the US is run. Granted rampant lobbying and climate change isn't as bombastic as whatever Trump is dishing up, but they are real problems that require attention.Your understandable crisis fatigue does not change that. >Second, the topics she's railing against are often completely inconsequential compared to the many, many huge problems she's gonna be facing in Congress. One article was about her complaining about a Harvard orientation, ffs. What she is having a problem with was it being a one sided lobbying event called an orientation. I am amazed that you seem to suggest that lobbying is inconsequential. Do you really not see a problem with giving companies the ability to buy influence to the degree it is being done? >third, I'm upset that complain is all she seems capable of doing. From the likes of Pelosi (who she was taking to task earlier) and others, I hear about pledges of investigation, focused messages, calls for unity. From her I just hear that everything sucks with no plans to change it. She is a freshman congress woman, who have not taken office yet. You should be happy she is not using Trumpian tactics of promising things she cannot deliver. The stuff she is focusing on does not require investigation as they have been made legal, they require change. To change things within congress itself require leverage. Hence her using the absurd amount of media attention to highlight the problems that need change, thus starting the debate. Considering how much attention she's getting it makes me very worried that she's going to leech momentum from the party at a time when they very much need all they can get. Now this is a valid concern, if the democratic party resists change to lobbying laws and climate politics they are going to loose all the people paying attention to her.

"It’s kinda tricky, because in a way, they’re very fair, because you’re paying for infrastructure in a rough proportion to how much you use it, And its tricky because defining “use” can be difficult. If a business can pay lower wages because they hire workers that live in lower cost housing and commute, then that’s also using that infrastructure. Or, forget about saving money on wages, good infrastructure allows a business to draw on a larger labor pool than they could otherwise to more easily fill their staffing needs. In fact, since a typical worker should be generating much more in profit for the business than they are paid in salary, there may be an argument for the business getting more benefit out of the infrastructure than the commuter. Or, for example, consider someone who runs a cafe in a central business district that is successful due to the large concentration of workers commuting in every day. They are getting use out of that infrastructure too, as well any number of others. So, only asking the commuters to foot the bill for the roads (via a gas tax) instead of everyone who benefits is rather unfair too. ",t3_a2ebf9,neutralnews

She said she listed herself as a minority in the professional listings merely to connect with “people like me,” noting that it was “not a particularly good use for the directory, because it never happened.” [...] Warren said she didn’t know Harvard had used her heritage as proof of diversity until reading about the issue in the news, according to a Herald report. She also denied that she ever tried to gain a professional advantage through her lineage. Warren also says that she was recruited for these positions — she did not “apply” for them, as Brown asserts. [...] The Herald has twice quoted Charles Fried, the head of the Harvard appointing committee that recommended Warren for her position in 1995, saying that the Democratic candidate’s heritage didn’t come up during the course of her hiring. “It simply played no role in the appointments process,” he said. “It was not mentioned and I didn’t mention it to the faculty.” [...] Warren finally accepted a tenured teaching job at Harvard in 1995.

"Communication works well sometimes when you're already in a relationship. But if youre meeting new people for romantic purposes, it's whats not communicated verbally that drives attraction. Women will more often than not lose attraction due to too much talking. I don't know why it's the case, but it's almost a truism in my experience being single and dating for a couple decades now. I have a hunch that it's just something biological since it works the same way in many different cultures (have lived in 3 different countries with very different cultures). Communication as a way of sabotaging attraction aligns with what neurobiology has to say about attraction as well. Lust and attraction is associated with shutting off the prefrontal cortex and the stimulation of the hypothalamus. Telling people to engage their rational brains when biology is actively shutting it down for romantic encounters might work, but it's definitely an uphill battle. I've had the benefit of experiencing dating without this heightened scrutiny and it was already difficult, awkward, and nerve racking. Some girls would creep me out (was slapped by one for refusing her sexual advances once). And I'm sure I probably made some uncomfortable too. I can only imagine how much more difficult it would be for socially awkward or just plain unattractive men to try to navigate this new terrain where social media can ruin careers and lives. Until new social rules are clarified, or online call-out culture dies down, it's going to very dangerous for socially inept men. I feel like we need to allow for some awkwardness and discomfort in dating, and it won't interfere with the goal of exposing and taking down actual predators. ",t3_a2oqlf,neutralnews

The belief and faith you can place in that institution.

Organizations who have won a Pulitzer for their investigative journalism for example, and that have a good history of their sources being reasonably accurate.

"I am curious what happened between 9pm when they detained her and 5am when she was placed on a bus to another facility. Was there no access to water for those 8 hours? The end of that article you provided is quite terrifying. It goes on to say that nearly half of the deaths in custody since 2010 are related to substandard care. According to  \- 'Neither type of inspection ICE uses to examine detention facilities ensures consistent compliance with detention standards or comprehensive correction of identified deficiencies.' So who exactly decided to massively expand the rate of detention? It is public knowledge (from the DHS OIG link) that multiple facilities that failed inspections in 2006 failed to make corrections by 2017. The powers that be should be well aware that there is a lack of accountability and also that substandard care is leading to deaths and perhaps should find an alternative until they can fix those issues. If facility policies are not enforced, and even worse not corrected when reported, then increasing the scope for detainment seems like it would naturally lead to an increase in situations like this.

That implies a relationship of power where she's subordinate. Whoever is going up against Trump needs to be aware of this game because it's where he plays.

I agree with Solomon's characterization of the major difference between the Chapman and Butina cases, and how they reflect the different leadership of Mueller and Comey. It makes me more of an agnostic than anything, though. I don't agree with your summary of the article: >this is yet another example of the FBI knowing what was going on and doing nothing about it because it would make the right look bad once the media got a hold of it. I think this was rather a difference of opinion on how to handle these kind of cases: whether to act to prevent anything from happening in the first place (Mueller), or to enable in order to draw out potential domestic conspirators (Comey). I don't know enough about the situation or the effectiveness of each tactic to say what was right at the time. >There are too many important things going on to be pushing this Russian collusion narrative which has no substance. Anyone, including democrats, who focuses too much on Russia, or especially 'collusion', is missing the real implications of the Special Counsel investigation. Many people who criticize the Clintons do so by accusations of an apparent 'pay-to-play' system they run. By that logic, those same people should be even more upset with a Trump presidency for the same reasons, especially given how much more evidence there is that this is what is happening.

"From the article: 'are removing guidance meant to reduce racist discipline practices that run rampant in public schools around the country. It’s no secret that students of color, particularly Black boys, are disproportionately disciplined compared to their White peers—four times as likely according to the U.S. Office for Civil Rights' The writer needs to prove that racism is the cause here. It may be but an argument must be made. Here's a 12 year old comment site with arguments about this issue, maybe the author could learn something from it:  More from the article: 'Black boys comprise only 15 percent of all students but represent 35 percent of students suspended once, 44 percent of those suspended more than once and 36 percent of students expelled.' We'll accept the stats. But an obvious question pops up, what is the percentage of black boys in the schools these stats are taken from? If the schools are mostly black, with mostly black teachers wouldn't that support another argument besides racism for these outcomes? 'The problem: misbehavior, disproportionately among Black boys, who faced a disparate impact of school disciplinary policies. The solution: full stomachs and camaraderie.' So the author supplies one anecdote that shows the behavior of this group of black boys wasn't acceptable, and thus they were disciplined more often. So the genesis of this issue in this case was the behavior, not racism. Then the solution was making sure the kids were fed properly. Seems the people causing harm were the parents of these kids. I don't think I need to go on. This educator doesn't seem to know how to write an argumentative essay, which is English 101. Additionally, it's outrageous to argue that currently any racism on the part of teachers/administrators wouldn't immediately addressed. ",t3_a6gkl1,neutralnews

">It is the failure of these boys' parents that has created the discrepancies. Which the author claimed in the article. >Quote from the article where it says this? 'The problem: misbehavior, disproportionately among Black boys, who faced a disparate impact of school disciplinary policies. The solution: full stomachs and camaraderie.' Who is responsible for feeding children? Parents. I'll assume that all agree feeding one's children is about the most important obligation a parent has. But again the author said the issues at Eggerts Crossing Village were resolved by making sure the kids were properly fed and taught some socialization skills. So where's the racism? Who is responsible for teaching children how to socialize? Parents.  You can't determine bad behavior unless 1, Someone breaks rules that define bad behavior, and 2, someone analyzes that data. As I've said, the first comment to my comment didn't address anything but one statement out of many statements. Which I specifically said, was my opinion.

" Abstract: Even in a unionized environment where work tasks are similar, hourly wages are identical, and tenure dictates promotions, female workers earn $0.89 on the male-worker dollar (weekly earnings). We use confidential administrative data on bus and train operators from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to show that the weekly earnings gap can be explained by the workplace choices that women and men make. Women value time away from work and flexibility more than men, taking more unpaid time off using the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and working fewer overtime hours than men. When overtime hours are scheduled three months in advance, men and women work a similar number of hours; but when those hours are offered at the last minute, men work nearly twice as many. When selecting work schedules, women try to avoid weekend, holiday, and split shifts more than men. To avoid unfavorable work times, women prioritize their schedules over route safety and select routes with a higher probability of accidents. Women are less likely than men to game the scheduling system by trading off work hours at regular wages for overtime hours at premium wages. These results suggest that some policies that increase workplace flexibility, like shift swapping and expanded cover lists, can reduce the gender earnings gap and disproportionately increase the well-being of female workers.",t3_a4xhi6,neutralnews

"Everyone knew that. The question was whether there is any recourse. Saudi is allowed to kill their own citizens for speaking out against the crown. They are allowed because they have been allowed to openly do so for decades.  Covering it up doesn't make it better or worse. Heck, some countries in the UN have execution vans that hide executions from the public.  So if it was an international offense to kill their own citizen merely because that citizen did business with the NYT, then that is saying that any person who does business with American companies gets US rights. And that would be near impossible to enforce. This isn't to say that Saudi Arabia is a country we should be allied with. They are a horrible ally, but to say that this is the straw that broke the camel's back is to be hugely ignorant of the criticism they have received for decades from the fringes of US politics. Why is it that it takes a NYT contributor to die that the NYT finally opposes Saudi Arabia? The reason why the reason matters here is that if we break alliance with Saudi Arabia, the way to get back into good graces should not be to apologize for Kashoggi's death and carry on. The resolution is to give their citizens free speech rights. But if the Kashoggi thing is the biggest issue, they'll just apologize profusely to the NYT and go back to killing journalists that don't contribute to the NYT. ",t3_a34bnv,neutralnews

Add to that the fact that voter fraud hasn't been proven to be a serious issue, or that the small percentage of such fraud that exists would be prevented by a voter ID, it's hard to argue that the government has a compelling government interest in even creating a voter ID law, which is the first test for whether a restriction on a Constitutional right is permissable.

"Excellent coverage by : [In February 2018], the committee that ran President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities released basic details about its revenues and spending. Trump raised $107 million, almost twice the previous record, and spent $104 million. The committee’s tax filing showed that $26 million of the spending went to an event planning firm started in December by a friend of the First Lady. It’s not clear how the firm spent that money, or how most of the money raised for the inauguration was used. The tax filing doesn’t show spending by subcontractors, nor is it required to do so. In this week’s episode of Trump Inc., we dig into the inauguration. We’ve found that even experienced inaugural planners are baffled by the Trump committee’s massive fundraising and spending operation. We also noticed that two members of the inaugural committee have been convicted of financial crimes, and a third — the committee’s treasurer — was reportedly an unindicted co-conspirator in an accounting fraud. Greg Jenkins led President George W. Bush’s second inaugural committee in 2005, which raised and spent $42 million (that would be $53 million in today’s dollars). Asked about how Trump’s team managed to spend so much more, Jenkins said, “It's inexplicable to me. I literally don't know.” “They had a third of the staff and a quarter of the events and they raise at least twice as much as we did,” Jenkins said. “So there's the obvious question: where did it go? I don't know.” Steve Kerrigan, who led both of President Obama’s inaugural committees, agreed. “There was no need for that amount of money,” said Kerrigan.” We literally did two inaugurations for less than the cost of that.”",t3_a5ymqn,neutralnews

"Interesting claim as to why she attempted to infiltrate conservative circles, do you have a source? You're right that we haven't seen recent evidence of them attempting to infiltrate more liberal circles, but you seem to be suggesting that the Russian government left the Democratic party alone. It's tough to argue which activity is more hostile, but I think it's fair to say that the hacking of the DNC and subsequent leak of those emails was more overt.  While the opinion piece you linked to certainly made a good point about the stylistic differences between Directors Mueller and Comey, and the complaint about Comey's watch and wait style is entirely valid, it doesn't support the assertion that it was to 'make the right look bad' but merely repeats it. The Russian government engaged in active measures against the government of the United States. There are indictments against more than two dozen Russian nationals and three Russian companies ( That is substantive. You're correct that no Americans have been charged with crimes *directly* related to this conspiracy *yet*. Several have been indicted or pled guilty to lying to investigators about conversations related to this conspiracy, though, which indicates that, at the very least, the Trump campaign was aware of at least *some* of these active measures.

"I'd love to learn how a few weeks equates to 10-20% of wage growth years. People don't generally stop working while they are pregnant. Most jobs are drastically increasing flexibility because the job market is tight and it is a low cost benefit that everyone wants. That said if you have one partner who has a flexible job that means the other can take a less flexible job. I know plenty of couples where the man is the one with the more flexible job. Not to mention that the flexibility aspect required is when kids are older. And it can be picked up by either parent. Yes it traditionally falls on the woman but what came first - the chicken or the egg? I've met women whose husbands refused to pick up their son from school or cook dinner or clean even though they both worked. Luckily I don't run into that much anymore, but it's pretty typical for guys I know to leave early to take kids to practice, or go to a school event, and I don't think it used to be that way. Men are wanting to be more involved in family life now, and that is where this gap will begin to decline. ",t3_a4xhi6,neutralnews

Further down the article, the author details other elements of the campaign.

Think of it this way: every insurance company negotiates its rates with hospitals. But hospitals don't want insurance companies knowing the rates it negotiated with other insurance companies--or everyone will demand the lowest price. To avoid that, hospitals create the chargemaster, and everything on it is priced much (much) higher than what the highest-paying insurance negotiated. That way, every insurer that looks at it thinks, 'Wowee, we negotiated a good price!' (Well not really; they know how the system works.

"It’s virtually impossible to claim that the “NYT, WaPo, CNN, or any of the major TV networks” are anything but extremely biased to the left. I agree that there's bias in those sources. I actually don't take CNN seriously anymore, and i'm very skeptical of anything I see from NYT that isn't just reporting straight facts. That said, it's entirely possible to extract the factual stuff out of those places and get passed the bias. Moreover, I don't think we're ever going to find a source that's not biased. The best we have is trying to conglomerate competing sources and extract what's common across them. And, to this sub's credit, they don't have a strict ban on a lot of sources, so we actually *can* try and find that common information. I don't disagree that there's a left leaning bias in this sub. But that's a numbers game (more lefties than righties). It's not part of the sub's structure. And to *that* end, this sub hides vote counts so that people are less likely to be influenced by the political 'center of gravity' towards a given comment. Finally, even if a lot of the folks here are lefties, you can still engage them, and the sub's rules force people to play it as straight as possible. So if you see a leftwing position you disagree with, you *can* engage it honestly without worry that you'll get brigaded by people who merely don't like what you say.

We bought all of the hardware we needed out of the back pages from some gun magazine that was on store shelves. This weapon used 2 semi-automatic hunting rifles. We took the stocks and trigger guards off, and mounted the 2 guns upside down onto tripod. We then equipped each gun with a 50-round drum magazine. To fire them we bought a gear assembly with a hand crank. That hand crank had 2 spaced gears perfectly timed so that each tooth in the gear struck the trigger when you turned the crank. It was, quite literally, a dual-barrel Gatling gun, equipped with one hundred rounds in total. We got so we could change the magazines quite quickly -- it was a helluva lot of fun to blast empty beer bottles with.

"All fair points. Though, I would disagree with it being easy to find the facts and get past the (news source) bias. The bias is often embedded in the “facts.” Given that many sources that are quoted are anonymous and can’t be corroborated. This creates a spiral of “truth” when the lies are buried deeper in the “research” or “anonymous” quotes. Then those buried lies are used to substantiate previous claims. BTW; this isn’t a knock on the sub. The mods do a nice job in a very difficult political climate. We need to make sure we critique not just each other’s links, but the sources of those links as well.

"&#x200B; “(W)hen I hear people say they don’t like identity politics, I think it’s important to remember that identity politics doesn’t just apply when it’s black people or gay people or women,” Obama said. He then cited examples, er, all related to black people. “The folks who really originated identity politics were the folks who said Three-Fifths Clause and all that stuff. That was identity politics,” the former president insisted. “Jim Crow was identity politics. That’s where it started.” For someone who was supposedly an oh-so-brilliant constitutional professor, Obama sure seems to have a murky view of American history. The Jim Crow era — which he claims was where identity politics started — began a hundred years *after* the Three-Fifth Clause. Yes, we’re supposed to believe that identity politics originated with the Founding Fathers, while also originating a century later with Jim Crow laws, which were  comment.

"I’m sensing that I may have offended you somehow, and if that’s the case I apologize. I want this conversation to continue and for that to happen it might help to clarify what’s I’m saying. My initial argument is that the findings of the academic article we’re discussing is not *essentially* divergent from the current academic discussion, its contribution is to add new considerations as to why women make the decisions they do. I believe your argument is that it *is* essentially divergent from the popular discussion. So in that case I should clarify what I meant by “popular:” I meant the discussion that takes place outside the social scientific community, especially as it diverges from that community. My second argument is that such divergence should be minimized, and we can minimize it by disregarding the popular discussion. I’m also challenging your perception of the popular discussion as being guided by strawman arguments put forth by the media specifically, but I’m admittedly not backing that up with any citations, which I think is fair because so far neither have you. I think your leap to call yourself a demon was an overreaction. I didn’t make any assertion like that, but again I believe your argument is against what you’ve rehearsed and not based on what I myself am arguing. And I agree with you that if the popular discussion emphasized that women fight against forces that aren’t responsible for the pay discrepancy, that sort of discussion should not be acknowledged. To be honest it doesn’t sound like we disagree on much. If it can be shown that inequality of opportunity exists, we as a society should rectify those inequalities. This article doesn’t deny that there’s an inequality of outcomes (again, my original comment pointed this out), but it provides different considerations for why the outcomes arise. In turn, it shouldn’t be taken alone, it should be taken as a part of the overall and ongoing discussion within the field. ",t3_a4xhi6,neutralnews

The bill specifies mandatory **area-specific technology** and infrastructure that includes **watch towers**, **camera systems**, **mobile surveillance systems**, **ground sensors**, **fiber-optic tank inspection scopes**, **portable contraband detectors**, **radiation isotope identification devices**, **mobile automated targeting systems**, **unmanned aircraft**, **radar systems**, **helicopters**, and **marine vessels**, among other minimum requirements. The bill mandates **24-hour surveillance of the border region using mobile, video, and portable systems**, as well as **unmanned aircraft**, and deploys **1,000 distress beacon stations** in areas where migrant deaths occur. Interior enforcement against visa overstays is also increased. The Department of Homeland Security is required to initiate removal (deportation) proceedings, confirm that relief from removal is pending or granted, or otherwise close 90 percent of the cases of immigrants who have overstayed their visas by more than 180 days in the last 12 months.

Even if directing him to do it, could it be treated the same way as an employer telling an employee to rob a bank? Assuming that the jury is convinced that this payment was made in order to influence the election rather than as a personal matter, yes. Directing/Conspiring with somebody to violate campaign finance laws in this way would still be a felony. In this case, either Trump conspired with Cohen's contribution of way more than the $2700 donor limit *or* he contributed the money himself (legal) but did not report the donation (illegal). >if Cohen made the payment out of his own pocket from Donald’s request, should Donald still be help liable? I would argue that he should still be liable. You shouldn't be able to break the law simply because you can find a partner. Cohen took out a loan against his house to pay Stormy Daniels and the reimbursement was in monthly installments disguised as 'legal consulting fees.' Structuring the transfer of money in this way could be taken as a sign that they are knowingly attempting to break the law. Of course, paying and disclosing defeats the whole purpose of keeping the affair hidden; I understand why they didn't report but it wasn't legal. There's also reports that the National Inquirer's parent company knowingly gifted what is termed *in-kind contributions* by collecting stories like these under 'catch and kill' contracts where they pay for exclusive rights and then don't publish anything.

"Latinos are one of the diverse political groups due to their above average religious participation and tight family structure. The Latino presence is even more pronounced in Los Angeles since they represent 50 percent of the population of the city and 48 percent of the county. Yet this demographic heft is not reflected in political, social, or economic influence. And even in the religious sphere, where Latinos have a higher Christian commitment than the population at large, their role is limited, at best. According to a 2007 Pew study of Latino religious tendencies,* 68 percent of Latinos are Catholics, 20 percent are Protestants, three percent are other types of Christians (Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Orthodox), one percent are adherents of other religions and eight percent define themselves as secular (though some of those in this category might define themselves as spiritual). 91% of Latinos identify as some sort of christian, 8% identify as secular. About 30% of Latinos voted republican in 2016, which is right on par with asian and 'other' minority affiliation. Black is the only minority which voted only 10% for GOP.   Religiously oriented Latinos, Catholic and Protestant, tend to create tensions for the traditional political categories in Los Angeles and the U.S. On issues like abortion, same sex marriage or religious influence in politics, most Latinos, particularly evangelicals/ Pentecostals, identify with conservative positions. But when addressing issues like immigration, government guaranteed health insurance, or a willingness to pay higher taxes for broader government services, most Latinos identify with positions normally considered liberal.  So latinos should be a prime target for any conservative political group, but the GOP extreme anti-immigration status, and general racial rhetoric tends to create more apathy in their community as it reminds them of how chaotic politics was back in their native land and they dont believe anything will change.  So if anything, this is no different than where politics are generally: the people who consistently go to the polls arent changing their mind.

Keeping bases there too makes it easier to stamp on any ISIS re-emergence quickly - it will be back as its an ideology not a country and there are a lot of angry, poorly educated men in that area that are spoiling for a fight and just need a prod from a manipulative state like say the Saudis (they started ISIS to bring down their religious enemy, Assad).

">The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a government agency responsible for processing the sexual harassment complaints that do get reported, says nearly one-third of the 90,000 complaints received in 2015 included a harassment allegation — but the agency notes that that number is far too low to reflect reality. They also estimate that 75 percent of all workplace harassment incidents go unreported altogether. >One 2003 study found that 75% of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some form of retaliation,” the EEOC report found.  People who report harassment and abuse face retaliation, being passed over for promotions, branded in a bad light, losing their job, having trouble finding a new job, and being blackballed... on top of being a victim of harassment or assault to begin with, which brings its own set of psychological consequences.

Imo, guaranteed federal student loans are the real driver behind price increases.

"1) I don't think the insignificant amount is speaking to the spending not being problematic, but rather an odd choice for politicians to be making stands on, as the monetary stakes aren't really enough to warrant something like a government shutdown. 2) continues to speak to that - this amount of money, which is not enough to be considered significant, has been spent on a number of other things that weren't targeted. Again, this isn't about the money being problematic, it's questioning the motives behind this particular issue, because the money alone clearly isn't a problem. Waste in spending is not the main thrust of the argument here. 3) is again not about knowledge of overspending being unnecessary, but rather that it's available publicly, if you want to look at it. Compare the cost of what Trump wants to shut the government down over to other things that cost the same, then imagine the response from the public to shutting down the government for, let's say, modifying the tobacco tax rates. His arguments aren't contraditory, because he's not talking about overspending being problematic or not, he's not talking about overspending being rampant, or that knowledge of overspending is unnecessary. He's saying the level of spending involved isn't commensurate to the action of a government shutdown, especially when it's focused on one specific issue. The argument is justified by other, similar spending objects not being made a deal of, then links a doc to see all the other things of a similar level of cost that the government isn't shut down to deal with. I think you're misrepresenting or reframing what he said, because what you're not talking about the same thing he is.",t3_a94tu9,neutralnews

Not that we're anywhere closer to answering this question -- in fact, one big issue that social activists raise when discussing lifetime pay inequality between the genders is the unequal expectations placed upon women as compared to men as far as child rearing goes.

": December 20, 2018 Dear Mr. President: I have been privileged to serve as our country’s 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals. I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence. One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO’s 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof. Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model – gaining veto authority over other nations’ economic, diplomatic, and security decisions – to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense. My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances. Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense who views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well to make sure the Department’s interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff in September in order to ensure stability within the Department. I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people. I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform. James N. Mattis ",t3_a83dzq,neutralnews
"Thank you. If you’re interested in exploring this further.., I’ve been to the KSA... from the second I landed it was clearly relayed to me that their laws are not to be trifled with, their punishments are extreme, and if I broke the law I’d largely be on my own. Come what may. Are Americans applying U.S. legal standards (due process, criminal rights, and etc) to a nation with a fundamentally different legal system? If so, how would the U.S. respond if the actors were reversed? Micheal Fay, a U.S. citizen, was caned after violating Singapore law. The U.S. recognized Singapore’s right to punish (but was successful in reducing the number of strokes). The U.S. bans “cruel and unusual punishment” yet recognized Singapore’s very different legal practices as valid. Does this act rise to the extrajudicial? In other words, is ordering an execution within the legal authority of the Crown Prince and/or the King of Saud? If Saudi royalty does have the legal authority to order the execution of a Saudi citizen on Saudi territory, what recourse does the U.S. have to protest a “valid” legal act?

It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can’t be legal? Only defame belittle. Collusion? Trump is once again pointing to the clear agenda setting by the corporate media. His point isn't that good natured satire is bad, its that there is a clear, constant, ceaseless barrage from the corporate media and its dem partners. Should entertainment have to have any semblance of neutrality? ",t3_a6um9u,neutralnews

"You probably have to wait 10 minutes because you violated a rule. Not because you disagreed. Even though the majority of people here are not in favor of trump, there are still quite a few who *are*, and they don't have the same problems that you are. I didn't see your original argument, so it's hard for me to comment on what went wrong in your original post. This sub *does* have a certain standard of dialogue that is required; sourcing your claims and not engaging in obvious displays of emotions are some of those standard. So if you want to make a direct claim like 'Trump hasn't lost his mind', that's something you'd need to source. I agree that that *is* hard to source, but that's because it's hard to make a definitive claim that he hasn't lost his mind. btw, I'm not making a statement about trump with that point; I'm making a statement about how difficult it is to prove a negative (that trump hasn't lost his mind). What you *can* do is actually start a discussion with the person. Eg: - 'What would you consider evidence that trump *has* lost his mind?' - 'Okay. I see all of NYT's arguments, but it seems like they're just cherry picking qualities they don't like about trump and claiming that these are indicative of someone who's lost their mind. What about when Obama/Hillary/Pelosi/anyone else did \*insert strange behavior\*. Nobody was saying they lost their mind when they did that, so it's hard for me to not think that NYT is just cherry picking trump's behaviors that they don't like.' - 'I think the whole 'trump lost his mind' claim is sort of a non-starter. How does one even prove this without a direct medical diagnosis? I find it suspicious that we only hear the negative things from those around him, and never anything positive. Do we have any sources on what some of those positive things are? There could be more to the picture that certain media outlets are ignoring.' What's often *not* tolerated around here is making a factual claim and assuming that it's common knowledge, making accusations that someone is engaging in bad faith arguing without giving a compelling reason to think so (eg, you gave a counter to their argument, they ignored your counter and just restated their argument), or just blatantly pitching for one candidate without supporting reasons. It takes a little trial and error to get it right, but if you stick around for a bit, try and absorb the format of discussion, and just allow yourself to make a couple of mistakes without getting resentful, you get the hang of it pretty quickly. And once you do, engaging with the community really takes your understanding of certain views (even your own views) to the next level, since they have to meet a much higher standard than one might usually hold themselves to.

">We  (edited to add source) that weapons that operate like a machine gun should be banned, and this ruling clarifies and codifies that. Just because we previously didn't ban them doesn't mean that we must always continue to not ban them. The problem is that the law doesn't say 'weapons that operate *like* a machine gun should be banned,' it says 'machine guns, *as defined here,* are banned,' and bump stocks clearly don't fit that definition. If people want bump stocks banned (and it would seem that they do), the way to do that is to either write a new law or amend the existing law. The thing is, that's the legislature's job, not the executive's. This goes way beyond simply 'interpreting' a law for the purposes of enforcing it, this is flatly changing it. Regardless of how you feel about bump stocks (or guns in general), you should be concerned about executive agencies being given the power to effectively ignore and/or rewrite the language of the law in order to forward an agenda (no matter the popularity or sensibility of that agenda).

"This is grossly misleading.

Why? Because he was bigger than her, and his “physical size” meant that “he was perceived as having power over her.” >To be fair, the document does report that the male student had also been pestering the female student for dates and wasn’t leaving her alone — which is, obviously, unacceptable — but the fact that his physical size was enough to constitute a violation-worthy power imbalance is absolutely ludicrous. You can see document about the case (PDF warning) . On page 10, it lists the statute in question: >b. **Sexual Harassment.** Sexual harassment is defined as: >1) Unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual activity by a person or persons in a position of power or authority to another person, or So they spend the whole article talking about how crazy it is that 'his physical size was enough to constitute a violation-worthy power imbalance,' while ignoring the fact that only fills out ONE of the requirements (position of power) of sexual harassment. This ignores what is, in my opinion, far more important. He also has to be putting forward unwelcome sexual advances. Which, as the document is very clear, he absolutely did (you can start reading on page 7 for that). It states that he repeatedly asked her out, repeatedly 'confessed his love to her,' and she repeatedly told him, both verbally and in written format, that she was not interested. Here's part of a message that she wrote to him, also on page 7 of the PDF: >Many of the things you say, like that Instagram comment for example, is over the top and I wouldn’t be comfortable hanging out outside of my places of work. I still want you to come to Tiger Tease and enjoy your time there, but I need my space outside of class and I think a line has been crossed here. He kept pursuing her even after this **very explicit** rejection of his advances. Shame on the author for saying things like: >The way in which this kind of thinking hurts men is obvious: They risk violating a law, and potentially being punished for it, over what every sane person could agree is normal human behavior. And also: >This, to me, is not feminism. To me, feminism should emphasize the strength of women; it shouldn’t portray us as incapable of handling normal social interactions on our own.

The US nor anybody is going to suddenly turn millions of people into western democracy lovers. I think what it comes down to is who do you want to have the most influence in that region? Iran, Turkey, Russia, or the US? If your goal is the least amount of suffering and the most stability, the US is generally the best for the job. Are we always great at the job? No. We've fucked up plenty. But generally we're the best the world has. You think Russia or Iran gives a shit about the yazidis getting massacred? You think Turkey gives a shit about the Kurds? Also it is to our economic advantage if the world is mostly peaceful. Our economy growing and other economies growing is generally a positive feedback loop.

And as we all know, the economy collapsed and job creators fled the country -- oh wait, we had some of the best economic growth the country ever saw, and invested in massive public infrastructure projects that are still paying dividends to this day. Academic research and real world experience show that (within semi-reasonable limits) the economy is almost completely insensitive to tax rates, Laffer be damned.

This deal stinks like dead meat in the sun after 5 days and sickens me that in a nutshell the blood of those poor bloody kurds is going to be on our hands so Trump Corp and Kushner Co can get Saudi funding for their property deals. Since when did America become a two bit 3rd world dictatorship? 1. Turkey is no longer a good friend to the West. It calls the Kurds terrorists because they are fighting for their own lands. Russia calls Ukrainian forces fighting them in Ukraine, terrorists.. China calls anyone opposing them terrorists.. Nazi Bloody Germany called resistance forces terrorists.. as wiser men say, someone's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.. what is happening on Turkeys SE border is repressive police action by Turkey against the Kurds to stop them breaking away and forming a nation with the Kurds in Northern Iraq and now northern Syria. A people left without a homeland because Sykes and Piquot drew some lines on a map after WW1. 2. Turkey has been busting Saudi Arabias balls and it has already been disclosed that Trump/Kushner tried to extradite main Erdogan opposition leader, Gulan, to Turkey as payment to stop Erdogan hounding Saudi Arabia. The deal was kyboshed as its illegal under US law to extradite someone who has commited no crime, is legally a resident and to a country where there is a 99% chance of them being executed. Now they've cooked up the next best thing.. the Kurds. Why? Because Kushner is bankrupt if his property deal which he gambled his entire family wealth on at 666 (uncanny number) Fifth Avenue is not refinanced in 60 days. Not one party has stepped up to do it except the Saudis, hence JKs lovefest with MbS. They have him by the balls.. 3. So we sell out our allies so TrumpKushner can make some personal cash, by helping the one country who is the nexus of evil in that region - Saudi Arabia (funder, promoter, staffer and spiritual source of all our Islamic terrorist worries).

Pull out of Afghanistan.. but do not turn over those kurds as once theyre gone there is going to be no one left in that corner of the world who will help us when the next 9/11 event occurs and it will because as good as our intelligence agencies and police forces are, they cannot be everywhere.. What really worries me is that Bolton is now no longer cock locked by Mattis and that moron wants a war with Iran.. which the Saudis want to.. and all the actors of GWB screw up are back together again including Betsy de Vos' brother, Erik Prince (blackwater) so we'll be back one more RPG palooza and another 20 years of 'nation building'.

"My original models were based on $500,000 birth trust, which is a nice even 2 Trillion per year in funding costs. That’s a lot to borrow, but if you consider that we currently borrow about a Trillion per year it starts to sound like a doable situation. The savings offered by the plan are twofold, first as children are put on the plan, the burden on the mandatory budget will start to shrink. This will be mirrored by savings at the state level because the programs and services formerly publicly funded for children will slowly cease to be needed except for young immigrant arrivals. I believe that over two generations the mandatory budget could be cut by 80% , which is a 2 Trillion savings per year. In the model the child has the benefit of the $500,000 until they turn 24 at which point it is reimbursed to the federal budget and the students trust switched from full support (snap,tanf, healthcare,education, housing) to a simple health insurance and retirement account. The 24year old presumably goes and works for 30 years while the account compounds, protected by excellent health insurance the entire time, and then retires early with millions in a retirement account. When they have children, the $500,000 seed money comes from the parents accounts....so the program becomes self funding in the second generation. This puts the total public investment at 60 Trillion or so plus financing costs. If I recall correctly the US currently has something like 80 Trillion in “unfunded liabilities” which we owe to current citizens. Just for perspective. To address your concerns: First the blind trust belongs to the child. So raiding it will be a significant social debate. The trust would be managed at the state level and would have a large team of lawyers and accountants representing the trustees. So there would be significant legal blowback in any attempt to tax it. Second, the child or the child’s parents will have limited ability to raid the account. Let’s assume that the child attends a public school which charges him tuition because he is outside the normal public spending arena by virtue of receiving his share at birth. The school will know the child’s trust number, will be properly accredited and managed by a school board etc, so it will simply register the child as a student and get the tuition directly from the trustee without the parents touching it. Healthcare and housing can be handled the same way. A child has a defined value in benefits from Snap, Tanf,HUD and CHIPs so in the event the parents are poor the child would receive stipends from the trust in the amounts otherwise available from those public programs. If the child is born sick and needs extensive medical care they would fall under a separate version in which the feds will pick up the tab until the child’s trust has grown sufficiently to pay the insurance cost. Or the feds could deposit a much larger amount and reimburse it later in life. I enjoy discussing the idea and I know I’ve overlooked and assumed things, so don’t be hesitant to criticize.

That said: Further, it seems beneficial to have heads of industry making inroads with congressional leaders so they can meet, greet, learn and collaborate. Surely that is exactly the assumption that she’s critiquing? That Congress exists to serve industry?

It says that few journalists have conservative political affiliations in their private life, and it says the public perception of bias has grown to a larger minority. Neither of these things suggest journalists at large are actually biased. If you want my personal interpretation, it's that prominent conservative political movements are decreasingly focused on facts and increasingly focused on conspiratorial thinking, which both reduces the set of fact-focused people interested in conservatism and increases the number of conservatives who see any criticism or opposition as a vast conspiracy ranging from 'the media' to 'the deep state.'",t3_a8utbr,neutralnews

"Ok, two main points here then. First, this act specifically has nothing to do with US citizens being affected abroad. All the examples listed above happened involving non-citizens; - Magnitsky, the namesake and inspiration for the bill, was a Russian . It was in fact the urtype of sorts for the eventual Russian sanctions that both the US and the EU put on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, and the EU looked to us for guidance on how to apply pressure to as big a player as Russia who has been traditionally untouchable in regards to it's human rights abuses. So yes, I would agree that some ideals are that important. I definitely come down on the side that we have, if not a legal imperative to defend the memory of someone who called America his home, then the moral imperative to use the power we have built to protect those that are most in need of protecting, even if it costs us some localized strategic influence.

The bump stock goes around this loophole by modifying the firearm (not relying on the cleverness and/or skill of the operator). Now either both need to be banned, or neither.

However you probably DID hear it the way you remember, either through echo chamber distortion on social media or because many things surrounding Trump Pence are not necessarily reported with perfect accuracy.

"I agree, I'm not a fan, in general, of the government mandating healthcare, however in some cases there are good arguments to be made for it. My general principle is that governments should not make laws to protect people from themselves, e.g. it should be legal to smoke, drink, etc as much as you want in your own home. You should be allowed to eat as much junk food as you want etc. However, vaccines dont just protect you, they protect other members of society whose bodies may not be able to fight off some disease as well as yours can. So in some cases, I can agree with requiring that people get vaccinated against certain things, at least while they are attending public school or something like that. But the 'anti-vax' movement is, as far as I can tell, more based on a scienceless fear of the vaccines themselves rather than an opposition to government mandated vaccination.",t3_a3d9x5,neutralnews

Illegal immigration had a roughly net neutral effect on the US economy even at its greatest influx and blaming illegal immigrants for economic decline is just racist scapegoating.

"Real question: Is there any ACTUAL evidence of vaccines causing autism or other major negative effects? The article I’m citing shows an example of heavy political bias fueling the anti-vax issue. Here’s the thing about medicine, and really about everything you can measure: the world is not clean. We do not live in a lab, and even in the cleanest lab in existence there is *still* contamination. We do not have 0% or 100% once you get to statistically significant scales. Like, literally never. Every year in the US, 1 in every 100,000 healthy individuals between 1 and 35 years of age, dies suddenly. ~70% of these victims are found to have structural heart abnormalities, so there’s a strong correlation there, but the *majority* of people with heart abnormalities do not suffer ill effects, so we don’t know for sure how much of that 70% dies from their heart defects, and there’s still the other 30% that dies without us having any indication of why. So there is at all times this soup of uncountable different causes and effects in the background, and if your “correlation” is beneath this background noise, in whichever relevant area, then your correlation is meaningless. If you test the safest drug imaginable (lets call it Bobrossamide) on 1,000,000 people under 35, remember that heart thing? Generally, 10 of those people are already going to die sudden, unexplained deaths. Vaccine critics (like basically anyone using statistics alone to scare you) ignore this, and it’s the central piece of the puzzle. Uncertainty is always present, even in a sample size of 1. So if you say, “Bobrossamide kills people! They did a study and 1 in 100,000 people died”. Well yes. You’re correct that 1 in 100,000 people died, but either from ignorance or manipulation, they’re ignoring the background. ",t3_a3d9x5,neutralnews

As the code didn't use the same wording in defining all three types of guns, that suggests that 'a single function of the trigger' should be defined as something different than 'each pull of the trigger'.

My intention earlier was to use those subsidies to make the current high priced vehicles more affordable, but incentivizing the production of a lower-end model may make more sense.

Giuliani said that the difficulty they had with answering Mueller’s questions made it tough to spend time on a report to counter whatever the Special Counsel’s Office put out. One former official said it’s tough to create a strategy that Trump himself could very well ignore. “We would always put together plans with the knowledge that he wouldn’t use them or they’d go off the rails,” that person said. “And at this point, with Mueller, they’ve decided they’re not even going to do that.” At the same time, Giuliani warned against letting Trump set the tone. “I don’t think following his lead is the right thing. He’s the client,” he said. “The more controlled a person is, the more intelligent they are, the more they can make the decision. But he’s just like every other client.

"As a practical consideration, how long would the election office need to wait before issuing an official count if they did not have a cut off time to receive mailed ballots similar to the cut off time of non-mailed ballots? I can see why such a rule would be implemented. But more telling might be the vote totals : - In the closest race Democrat Nikki Fried won her election as agriculture commissioner by 6,753 votes - Rick Scott ousted incumbent Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson by slightly more than 10,000 votes. - The Department of State late last week informed a federal judge that 6,670 ballots were mailed ahead of the Nov. 6 election but were not counted because they were not received by Election Day. - The tally prepared by state officials includes totals from 65 of Florida’s 67 counties. (97% of the counties) Quick and dirty napkin math: of 6,670 ballots / 97% = ~6,876 ballots. To change the result ~6,753 of them need to vote republican for agriculture commissioner to bring it to a tie, then 50%+1 of the remaining ~123 who vote on that issue need to also vote republican. Meaning they need at absolute minimum ~6,754 to vote republican and for all ~122 others to abstain on that issue. Under those most favorable of conditions, the percentage republican vote required is ~98%. If you assume that everyone votes on that issue, it's ~99%. On the issue of the election of the senator: the gap is too wide to possibly be covered unless the 2 counties that have not reported in have a vastly disproportionate number of mailed in ballots. By a full order of magnitude: 3% of the counties would need to have almost a third of the state's uncounted mail in ballots for there to be enough ballots to make a difference even if the ballots were 100% Democrat. TL;DR: It seems to me to be somewhat of a tempest in a teakettle. If the numbers from the article are correct, an upset from counting those votes is a near impossibility.",t3_a52txw,neutralnews

"They can so that may be a moot point if they knowingly ran under that contract, but its secondary to my second point. Is his job to pass a budget or represent the constituency? It is not the legislature's job to pass a budget. The Constitution gives the legislature with: No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. Also Hamilton in Federalist 58 said: The House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the support of government. They, in a word, hold the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the history of the British Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government. This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure. This does not say they have to pass a budget or that it is part of their job. Their most important and I would argue only job is to represent their constituency's want or what is best for them. Congress is not meant to be a team always. Their supposed to be opponents when their representation's ends do not coincide and contributors when their ends coincide. They are only teammates if you define their ultimate goal as doing right by the constituency and since we are not able to see into the future that means we can not judge on whether to pass a budget or not is the right thing.

"In a global economy the US is less than 10% of the population. A US full of millionaire retirees would drive a huge amount of economic activity. The demand for immigrant labor in the US would skyrocket and their kids would be eligible for the program. A blind trust means the beneficiary can’t directly spend the money. It can be charged towards health insurance, education, supplemental food and housing etc. by the second generation you can even have people self fund their kids birth trusts so that you only need federal money for immigrant kids. My model also assumes the beneficiary pays back the original seed money when they turn 24. Compounding interest is lovely. Edit: the trust doesn’t eliminate the need to work. It pays your health insurance for life and become a regular retirement account when you turn 55, so you can retire early on the earned interest. It’s just a hypothetical way to take the money we currently spend maintaining a welfare state that people say is woefully underfunded and traps people in misery....and spend it in a way that makes everyone secure and eventually wealthy.

This Washington Post article, as well as the Reason article and Factcheck article all seem to paint her erroneous tweet as proof that she and the other left democrats don't understand the budget implications of Medicare For All. The study she cited for the M4A cost is sourced from an extremely biased source (The Mercatus Center, conservative think tank funded by the Koch Brothers). The PR swing here isn't truthful: their study doesn't show M4A as being cheaper than our current healthcare system. However, that doesn't prove that M4A would cost that much in reality. It's a Conservative's viewpoint funded by Libertarians. So while ultimately this PR twist is failing for these Democrats, I warn you not to dismiss their entire platform as a result.

Therefore, he would have been in the clear if he had made an in-kind donation to his campaign by paying Daniels directly with his own money. He could also have used money raised by his campaign, including his own contributions, to pay Daniels. (Trump’s campaign took in a total of $333 million, with $66 million of that coming from Trump himself.) In either case, Trump’s campaign would be required to eventually disclose the expenditure. And under federal law, the campaign would also have had to disclose the contribution within 48 hours of receiving it, assuming Trump’s hypothetical contribution to the campaign were made within 20 days of the election. (If Trump had just paid off Daniels with money already contributed to the campaign, by himself or others, such an immediate disclosure would not have been necessary, but the expenditure might have been reported on the campaign’s so-called “pre-primary” report.)

"Where have I ever said anything here about forcing anyone to do anything? I mean, seriously, if I said this anywhere in this discussion then please post a link to it because I don't believe I have as I understand how many men are feeling uncomfortable by the perception of lurking dangers in being alone with women--even if I personally strongly disagree with this reaction--and I really don't like the idea of forcing them to do something that makes them feel uncomfortable. I am just hoping that my arguments will convince some people to see things my way and so do the things I wish they would do voluntarily; isn't that the whole point of having discussions like these? Besides which, as I have said elsewhere I think we should be coming up with solutions like getting rid of all 1-1 lunch meetings in order to not deny opportunities to women unfairly but also not force men into situations that make them feel uncomfortable.

"I'm very familiar with big 5. Being agreeable doesn't mean you are exempt from developing your disagreeable elements. That's not discrimination. That's what the process of self actualization is defined by. Be informed by your traits, not beholden to them. They only identify the difficult areas you have to invest more energy in principally because they don't feel as natural or yourself at ease when you need to call on them. Your personality has a large degree of placticity to it even though some fundamental aspects are relatively firm. The existence of a negative emotion is not evidence of harm nor deliterious intent (If that is what is motivating your response). There's no need to frame your response in a defensive stance, there was no attack. The same sexual dynamics exist in the work place. The context is different is all. Humans don't shut off their latent programs just because their environment changes. That's why creating a completely desexualized workplace would be a monstrous exercise and require a denial of humanity to institute. If that weren't true then there would be no concerns related to work or work related socialization like business dinners or lunches or off-site meetings. But work is still a social and sexual space. You can try to pretend otherwise, maintain that delusion, and experience difficulties by doing so, or you can acknowledge your shared humanity, a humanity that is distinctly absent purity and when you demand less purity of others, or purity of spaces, then you begin to deal with the real people beneath our collective fantasies of propriety and power. You know how many families have been formed from.romances started or sparked at work? We're a social species. Period.

">Chargemaster prices are still the prices everyone is paying and really is the price you are paying just not all at once. No. That's not right (and that's where our conversation goes off track). Chargemaster prices are NOT the prices everyone pays. Chargemaster prices are...pulled out of hospital administrators' asses, basically. Chargemaster prices are used as negotiation starting points when insurers and hospitals negotiate prices. Using your example, if someone has a $1000 deductible: Hos A: CM:$1900 INS:$1100 - patient pays $1000 (deductible), insurer pays $100, the end. Nobody pays the remaining $800. Hos B: CM:$1800 INS:$1050 - patient pays $1000 (deductible), insurer pays $50. The end. Nobody pays the remaining $750. Hos C: CM:$1700 INS:$950 - patient pays entire $950, insurer pays $0. The end. Nobody pays the remaining $650.00. Once the deductible is met, the insurer pays the entire negotiated price (*not* the chargemaster price), and the patient pays nothing.

They believe, rightly or not, that the difference between the harassment complaint and the discrimination complaint is that the former, thanks in part to \#metoo, has a much lower standard of evidence.

He was survived by three children who are (dual) U.S. citizens, and he entered the Saudi embassy to finalize some paperwork prior to marrying a Turkish National. His residency in the U.S. was under the provisions of a (temporary workers) O-Visa, and he was applying for a green-card. Is that accurate? If that is the case, then what legal standing (and responsibility) does the United States have in the matter? Does the U.S. have any standing due to Khashoggi’s U.S. residency?

I would support actions to stop state enforced segregation. But forcing people to associate is not an ethical action. I think people in general have moved far beyond ethical analysis. Essentially people's political advocacy is wishcasting, confusing intent with ability to enact an outcome, etc. The Civil Rights Amendment, title II, is an example of this. First, the purported intent was to stop discrimination. The obvious first problem with this is how does one know why people act? Unless a person says, no people of this race allowed, how would you know why a business owner chose not to associate with someone due to their protected class? Second, this is a direct infringement upon the right of association. You must interact with these people, period. Third, it is a huge increase in state power, ability to intervene in private transactions. Lastly, the Civil Rights Amendment was a response to other state actions. So the methodology that most argue should be the one and only methodology. >Nonetheless, there are patterns in groups and 'society' is a useful term when referring to them.

"Firstly, aren't you assuming here a bit as well? Aren't you assuming that the entire scope of this complex issue can be boiled down to one factor, the factor of 'poor parenting?' So bad behavior, inability to socialize at an age appropriate level, hunger, etc. The first and most important actors are the parents. There may be mitigating factors that excuse some failures, but the analysis should start with the parents. Respectfully, don't you think the parents have ethical agency? That they're responsible for their obligations? Why are you searching for some alternative boogeyman? >If you don't feel you're assuming, can you point to any research to show that black children are disadvantaged because of this one factor you've identified? Parenting isn't one factor, it's many obligations, requirements, etc. >wouldn't you continue that reasoning and claim that their poor parenting is, in turn, a result of the poor parenting they received?

It was thought that the reformation in the educations system to follow traditionalist enlightenment principles would give rise to remedys to societal ills when paired with government reform. Considering illiteracy rates dropped, college education became common place, and social issues **seem** to become more and more contrived (due to a partial solving of previous ones) i tend to agree this movement was a success. Im not sure what you are specifically asking, are you suggesting that teaching children how to read may or may not be a good idea because “we cant be sure”? Or am i missing your point entirely?

"First, consider Mattis' : During his more than four decades in uniform, Secretary Mattis commanded Marines at all levels, from an infantry rifle platoon to a Marine Expeditionary Force. He led an infantry battalion in Iraq in 1991, an expeditionary brigade in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terror attack in 2001, a Marine Division in the initial attack and subsequent stability operations in Iraq in 2003, and led all U.S. Marine Forces in the Middle East as Commander, I Marine Expeditionary Force and U.S. Marine Forces Central Command. During his non-combat assignments, Secretary Mattis served as Senior Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense; as Director, Marine Corps Manpower Plans Policy; as Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command; and as Executive Secretary to the Secretary of Defense. As a joint force commander, Secretary Mattis commanded U.S. Joint Forces Command, NATO’s Supreme Allied Command for Transformation, and U.S. Central Command. At U.S. Central Command, he directed military operations of more than 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Coast Guardsmen, Marines and allied forces across the Middle East. . Then note the structure of the letter. Mattis lays out two core beliefs, 'allies are a source of strength' and 'China and Russia are - at the very least - not necessarily our friends': * One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. ... NATO’s 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof. * Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model * My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. And then, * Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense ***who views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects***, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. Which is to say, these are not Trump's views. ",t3_a83dzq,neutralnews

Because then it’s like: ‘Well, I don’t want to go up and talk to her, because I’m going to be called a rapist or something,’” he said. “So you’re like, ‘Forget it, I’m going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked,’” Cavill said. “But it’s way safer than casting myself into the fires of hell, because I’m someone in the public eye, and if I go and flirt with someone, then who knows what’s going to happen? Now? Now you really can’t pursue someone further than, ‘No.’ It’s like, ‘OK, cool.’ But then there’s the, ‘Oh, why’d you give up?’ And it’s like, ‘Well, because I didn’t want to go to jail?’” Which honestly the more I think about his comments, the more I could see people (not just men) doing this to avoid situations where the other person could misinterpret their intentions and accuse them of sexual misconduct.",t3_a2oqlf,neutralnews

We cannot control the actions or re-actions of someone else and no one can really know someone else's intentions both current and future. In 1 on 1 interactions at least 50% of what happens is completely outside of our control and if you're rich / famous / powerful the risk to reward ratio in having private 1 on 1 interactions with members of the opposite (or even same!) sex can start to look pretty iffy. False accusation are rare but they _do_ happen and if you're rich / famous / powerful AND moderately careful why would you choose to run this risk at all?

"In response to #2, what I believe they are saying is that if Trump's campaign goal was to have Mexico pay for the wall (whether or not that be directly handing us money or through some indirect way), that should be worked out before demanding that US taxpayers pay for the wall. In other words, work out trade deals/tariffs with Mexico to get us on the path of gaining that money. Once a certain threshold is reached, and you can be sure that the money will keep coming in, then you can build the wall. Trump has made absolutely 0 effort to have Mexico pay for it.

"Should statements don't belong in discussions of reality. The only reason men push past no is because they are consistently punished for not doing so. MEN aren't the primary source of shaming for women. It is reproductive competitiveness. Women generally perform social violence in favor of physical and men physical over social. And you don't need shame at all for the behavior of putting barriers up to see what a guy does with them to offer women utility in filtering or vetting a potential mate. They KNOW words are cheap and they also know that the 'nicer' a guy is, the less they can trust his words. This is what THEY'VE been taught from years of engaging in courtship. Much if this is cross cultural btw. There's a lot about social signaling and behaviorism that identifies the folly in approaching these sexual dynamics with a constructivist or romanticized mindset. Or throwing any casual 'should' statements at what is a courtship process more nuanced and complicated than most are educated enough to actually understand. Or they wouldn't need 'should' statements to conceptualize it or possible solutions. Example:  This is why things like The Red Pill are so popular for sexual strategy. I don't care to hear anyone's moralizing over it, it is what it is, and to the extent it's relevant here, it's about why people go to it for utility instead of any main stream media messaging on the subject. What it highlights is the difference in what you're told you should do and what you are ACTUALLY rewarded for. We don't need to drastically change the socializing around sex (hint: nothing will change that because it's not purely socially constructed) we just need to be more honest about it as a society and stop trying to pretty it up with false romantic notions so we can participate in a collective delusion to maintain plausible deniability or a romanticized view of attitudes and behaviors surrounding sex.

Though large concentrations of very poor immigrants can be a net burden on the taxpayer.   The more interesting question to me is a philisophical one about 'good' and 'bad'. Whether or not a dramatic shift in culture immigration leads to increased difficulty and stress in life of the natives. Can immigration, though increasing economic activity, decrease overall happiness and contentment? I believe this is where most people's worry about immigration is, fear that immigrants will refuse to assimilate and alter the established ways of life.

"Well, we've created problems by breeding resistance into the weeds, but humans have been farming for 10,000 years and  Now, just 2-3 generations later, it's over 7 billion. As little as 40 years ago, famine was common in peaceful nations. Now, even though we have much greater population, we can generally feed everyone if the logistics are in place, and a lot of that is due to the increased yields of industrial farming, part of which is due to the use of these chemicals. So, you can see why this is a tough issue. If the whole world moved to organic farming, food would become a lot more expensive and more scarce. With so many lives on the line, that doesn't seem like a reasonable option to most people. On the other hand, polluted groundwater and collapsing bee populations isn't a particularly attractive prospect either. It's tough. That's why I can't really provide a solution, but people a lot smarter than I are working on it. What I'd like to see is an acknowledgement that we're trapped in this cycle where increasing resistance leads to ever greater use of potential environmental contaminants, and that this cycle cannot continue forever. I'd also like to see the kinds of farming that are the most damaging move to more modern methods, like industrial greenhouses and lab-grown meat. But staple grains are always going to take huge amounts of land and farmers will need technological help to meet the world's demands. Sometimes that technological help is going to come in chemical form. Where I think we'd do ourselves good in the long run is to invest in research to produce crops that are resistant to adverse weather conditions more than resistant to weed killers. (We already do quite a bit of this, but it's a question of priorities and, frankly, profitability.) This shift would allow the people in developing nations to grow their own food using their own (cheaper) labor instead of relying on nations like the US to produce that food at an industrial scale and then ship it around the world. Of course, US farmers don't like the sound of that, but a conflict between economic and environmental interests is nothing new.",t3_a65m9l,neutralnews

"Yes, it is. But you forget that it's a choice *both* parents make---the man and the woman in a relationship. Why should women, exclusively, be punished for that choice when it takes two to tango, so to speak? Or do you think that everyone, regardless of gender, should be punished for reproducing? (If your answer is the last then humanity will fall quite quickly with that way of thinking since less people having babies tends to mean that that society will weaken as a result of less 'new blood' in the workforce). My point is that, yes, while having kids is a choice, you don't often see most men suffering for that choice in their careers merely because society deems women the 'child-rearers' of the two and are thus less likely to be the breadwinners in the relationship because of that. I'd love to see more Mr. Moms in society or have both mothers and fathers rear their children equally. But until men start wanting to take a more active role in their children's everyday lives (rejecting after-work drinks with the boss to go pick up the kids from the babysitter, etc.) then there won't be much progress in this debate. Like I said, previously: The men are the ones with the power to change this in our society, so until they are willing to equally parent (and are willing to make the same sacrifices women make in their careers) then we're at an impasse in the discussion. Not to say there aren't men out there that co-parent equally or take on the lion's share of the responsibility of child-rearing, but it's not the majority in most of western society, sadly.",t3_a4xhi6,neutralnews

"That’s not what the argument is, and if people are making that argument they shouldn’t be. It’s a social problem, not an employer problem I never said you were making that argument. I made a general statement that's well in line with current dialogue on the topic. You then told me that's not how the argument is framed and replied that it was, actually, and you said I should read more books. I said I didn't think that was helpful because the popular discussion of the topic doesn't center around books or even the theories in them as they were written. You then said your definition of popular was essentially what is popular on campus. I reiterated that I didn't believe that was true and that, indeed, it violates the common definition of 'popular.' I explained why. Now you're telling me that I'm arguing against an argument you aren't making when you actually never made an argument at all. You're just trying to explain trickle down academic theory to me which I already understand and already commented on. You also seem to be gaslighting me. Look, you seem to believe that the academic discussion of the gender wage gap is both uniform and pure and that the media is simply distorting it along with a bunch of, presumably, misogynists. I don't doubt that some of that is true but the opposite is also true, that media in favor or fair pay for women, a noble goal, misrepresents academic theory and data in order to gain attention for the topic. Former President Obama even repeated the 77 cent myth while in office.

"To add to what you said, the author of the piece, John Phelan, is an economist at the Center of the American Experiment which is an . This shows the portion of the earnings gap that is due to personal choice in work leave and overtime. From the paper's conclusion: >'The gap of $0.89 in our setting, which is 60% of the earnings gap across the United States, can be explained entirely by the fact that, while having the same choice sets in the workplace, women and men make different choices.' The difference between the gap shown here and in all other jobs indicates there are other forms of gender bias at play which would be due to other factors. The study does not make the earnings gap go away -- it explains a portion of it. Mr. Phelan attempts to expand the study's narrow conclusion to oversimplify a complex dynamic. Something I would like the study to look into is what portion of the men and women were the majority wage earner in their respective households. Having that position, versus having a spouse who earns more per hour, would strongly influence which spouse took time off to tend to their family. If the men MBTA employees earned more than their spouses, they would be less likely to take time off as they 'can't afford a day off'. This is an outside influential factor that does not seem to be controlled for.

"I do not understand the context of the argument your statement combined with the sources you post are trying to make. The sources I posted along with my suggestion is that it isn’t the president’s tweets, or lack thereof, themselves that harm or help the market as a whole, but may affect specifically mentioned companies. It’s his actions and those actions can be enforced by tweets, or expectation of action. Threatening the fed, tweets about adding tariffs, turmoil, etc. all can affect the markets. He did add tariffs. Now the market wonders if he’ll start firing people at the fed.  In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has taken several steps that might end up conjuring up just such a panic. First, he shut down the federal government in an attempt to force Congress to fund a border wall with Mexico. Government shutdowns have happened in the past without serious economic consequences, but Trump is promising that this one will last a long time. Second, Trump has stepped up his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which has been raising short-term interest rates. Many presidents in the past have tried to jawbone the Fed into lowering rates, in order to provide a bump to an economy (and thus improve their re-election prospects). But instead of bullying Fed officials in a back room as past presidents have done, Trump has expressed his criticisms via social media and in press interviews, making the conflict between the presidency and the central bank more public and dramatic. Finally, Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, recently announced that he had called a number of big bank leaders to ensure that “they have ample liquidity available,” and convened an emergency meeting of the nation’s top financial regulators.

Have to wonder if the feelers were put out there to see the reaction (just like in any form of entertainment) and then Newt said NOPE (or he lied of course)  The acting attorney general Whitaker is apparently being considered and I think is the top current candidate. With the 'controversy' of him as AG, this would be a way to say 'see I listened and removed him from AG' while simultaneously keeping him on as Chief of Staff. It's only a matter of minutes until we get a 'Ivanka is most qualified for the job' tweet.",t3_a5rpdh,neutralnews

It still requires a trigger pull for every round fired. It mechanically resets the trigger using the action/reaction of the recoil without willful input by the operator to physically actuate their finger pressure off of the trigger to reach the reset point. That has nothing to do with being a machine gun. There is still an action required from the user - and the action of pushing the firearm forward causes the finger to contact the trigger and pull it again. You don't even need a bump stock to bump fire. Does any action of bump firing a firearm transform it into a machine gun simply because it can be fired rapidly?,t3_a7cv97,neutralnews

"Read the court's opinion before sharing your ignorant opinion... Hell, I'll quote the parts I think sum it up easiest from pages 9-11 >Voting in many areas of North Carolina is racially polarized. That is, “the race of voters correlates with the selection of a certain candidate or candidates.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 62 (1986) (discussing North Carolina). In Gingles and other cases brought under the Voting Rights Act, the Appeal: 16-1468 Doc: 150 Filed: 07/29/2016 Pg: 9 of 83 10 Supreme Court has explained that polarization renders minority voters uniquely vulnerable to the inevitable tendency of elected officials to entrench themselves by targeting groups unlikely to vote for them. In North Carolina, restriction of voting mechanisms and procedures that most heavily affect African Americans will predictably redound to the benefit of one political party and to the disadvantage of the other. As the evidence in the record makes clear, that is what happened here. After years of preclearance and expansion of voting access, by 2013 African American registration and turnout rates had finally reached near-parity with white registration and turnout rates. African Americans were poised to act as a major electoral force. But, on the day after the Supreme Court issued Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), eliminating preclearance obligations, a leader of the party that newly dominated the legislature (and the party that rarely enjoyed African American support) announced an intention to enact what he characterized as an “omnibus” election law. Before enacting that law, the legislature requested data on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans. Appeal: 16-1468 Doc: 150 Filed: 07/29/2016 Pg: 10 of 83 11 In response to claims that intentional racial discrimination animated its action, the State offered only meager justifications. Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist. Thus the asserted justifications cannot and do not conceal the State’s true motivation. “In essence,” as in League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (LULAC), 548 U.S. 399, 440 (2006), “the State took away [minority voters’] opportunity because [they] were about to exercise it.” As in LULAC, “[t]his bears the mark of intentional discrimination.” Excuse me if it's a bit wordy, court documents tend to be. But this inane argument you're making for voter ID laws is especially out of place here. >Also, why do I need an ID to drive, buy alcohol, buy cigarettes, own a gun, enter a US government building, and even attend a concert, but not vote? Because people are already identified... You register to vote in your respective locales, then are required to identify yourself and sign to verify your identity. Voting is also a right, unlike most of the things you mentioned. Something the Republican government of North Carolina sought to remove in order to better secure their political position. That should bother you, and instead you leap to their defense. I can't say that's admirable. ",t3_a2jddu,neutralnews

CNN did peak with 2.3 million simultaneous streaming viewers, up from 1.3 million simultaneous viewers in 2009, but that may be due to the fact that live streaming technology has improved to the point where networks are simply able to handle the higher bandwidth today than they were eight years ago. The make things simple, we can concede the 1 million additional online instead of getting lost in the weeds on 17 million vs 21 million.

"Specifically, we can look at what  based on plans drawn up late last year: [...] Jim Mattis quietly hinted at something far more important. The United States would not be withdrawing its forces from Syria after the anticipated defeat of ISIS, as President Trump had been promising since his inauguration. Instead, the defense secretary suggested that American forces not only would remain but could even expand their role. “We’re going to make sure we set the conditions for a diplomatic solution,” Mattis said. “You need to do something about this mess now. Not just, you know, fight the military part of it and then say, ‘Good luck on the rest of it.’ ” In a quieter time, Mattis’s comments might have made headlines: Here was a potential shift in America’s tortured efforts to manage the Middle East, and one that was bound to ignite conflict with Turkey, a NATO member and ally. In late December, Mattis offered more details at another briefing, saying that America was moving from a purely offensive role in Syria to a “stabilizing” one. He spoke of sending more diplomats and contractors, reopening schools, bolstering public health — a plan that would grow to include deploying new border forces and promoting economic renewal, all with a view toward helping Syrians topple the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Although Mattis has a reputation as Hawk, there is a pretty big fundamental difference about how he expresses that in comparison to Trump; It was almost possible, listening to Mattis at the start of his tenure, to imagine him as the spokesman of an emerging Trump Doctrine not so different from what Hillary Clinton — herself something of an Iran hawk — might have staked out in her first term. Like her, Mattis was an advocate of muscular diplomacy backed by credible threats of force. He was uncomfortable with President Obama’s vacillations and his failure to hold Syria and Iran to account, but (unlike Trump) he was a devout believer in working through allies and upholding agreements. Mattis supports diplomacy before military intervention, but he is a big believer in following through with whatever decision you end up making to the end. For Trump, who has flip flopped like crazy on basically every issue and doesn't seem to actually hold any conviction, that type of consistency was anathema. Mattis worked hard to mold our Syrian strategy into one of alliance with the Kurds, supporting them and providing them with the security from outside forces to fight extremists in the area. This recent change in policy to pulling out has the very real consequence of potentially condemning good men in Syria to die, and Mattis, who has endured a lot of disagreements in policy with his boss over these last 2 years, can't abide by that. To him it is a gross betrayal and a violation of everything the US armed forces stands for.",t3_a83hwh,neutralnews

">What were the others? 1. CEO With the heartless greed and sadistic ambition displayed on Wall street since the 2008 financial collapse, it may come as no surprise that the first place on the list goes to the modern-age equivalent of a pharaoh. Capitalist positions of leadership offer power, autonomy, command, and status — a perfect battlefield for the ambitious and ruthless to compete. Where once pyramids littered the dessert in tribute to vain kings, we now have skyscrapers and corporate logos filling the clouds above. 2. Lawyer Lawyers cloak themselves in the language of their field, making the laymen reliant on their expertise to survive in a courtroom. In the fog of legalese linguistics and glibly twisted logic, you better pray your lawyer is the most bloodthirsty of the two. There's a reason Shakespeare hated them so much, and why they continue to be the butt of so many jokes. Lawyers have a reputation for distorting the systems of equality, specifically for the purposes of ensuring their financial success. For every white knight district attorney looking to uphold the pillars of justice, you are sure to find a handful of bleak-hearted cynics and cutthroats. 3. Media If our collective society is a living organism, where better for the egomaniac to reside than on the radio or TV? To be the voice of the people, the face of their information and entertainment, and to influence our collective minds. Of course, once your self-worth becomes invariably tied to your ratings and popularity, you're in for an eventual downfall of depression and despair. 4. Salesperson In a numbers game, there's no room for emotion. Who has the greatest mental prowess? Manipulative charm? Who can wield the finest array of half-truths to convince a customer and close a sale? For those who like to compete for status and feed an ego through the defeat of colleagues, there is no better place to be than sales. 5. Surgeon The field of surgery offers more than the power of life and death. It's a clinical world of high-pressure stakes, where decisions must be made without emotion. What job nurtures a bigger power complex, than one where you can cut people open on a daily basis, tinker with their frail internal mechanics, and aggrandize your status as a giver or taker of life? 6. Journalist Much in the same way that media attracts the egomaniac, journalism (and writing in general) can draw those who wish to be revered from a distance. The ability to embed ideas and conversations in paper, and have them be absorbed en masse by readers, has only grown with the proliferation of the Internet. Now everyone with a phone, ipad, laptop or Google glasses can connect to an instantaneous world of information that stretches across the planet in seconds. The champions of that information are the self-appointed revealers of 'truth' – constantly seeking to influence others through their articulation and mental prowess. 7. Policeman The power of life and death on your hip, a badge of authority on your chest, a uniform of distinction, and a really loud siren! Everyone’s familiar with the stereotype of a bad cop — those officers who readily abuse their power, resent the people they are meant to protect, and use cold-hearted superiority to justify their viciousness. It's an unfortunate reality that some of the biggest criminals lurk among those who've sworn to uphold the law. 8. Clergyman What better way to fulfill your God complex than become one his messengers? If you embody and speak for the higher forces of the universe, people’s admiration and congregation around you will constantly stroke the darkest portions of your vanity — at least until they catch you abusing children. It's no wonder religions have veered away from monastic humility towards gaudy temples of lavish gold and marble. 9. Chef There are few things we do on a daily basis that are more intimate than eating food. The sustenance we put in our body can heal us, warm us, increase our pleasure and decrease our stress. It can also poison us, infect us or outright kill us. The seduction and love of food is very powerful — and controlling it, corrupting it, or being worshipped for creating it can greatly appeal to the egomaniac. 10. Civil Servant Whether you're a minor-level bureaucrat suffocating the masses in red tape protocol, a hair-piece smiling robot claiming to embody the American dream, or a hypocrite ranting about moral platitudes while keeping your gay sex slave locked in your closet — there’s always plenty of room for sociopaths in the political arena.

The Board concluded that it was not an objective of the Statement to provide information needed to evaluate the effectiveness of tax abatement programs and, therefore, did not modify the disclosure requirements to include information about the benefits of these programs.

Unlike other federal employees, senators and House members continue to get paid through a government shutdown. That’s because their salaries are literally written into the Constitution. Article 1, Section 6 specifies, “The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.” Under Article I, Section 6 is cannot be decreased, withheld, lowered, or whatever other games you want to play with during their term.

"EVs are going to dominate. Hydrogen is the only other serious alternative. Battery capacity/cost has had big improvements this year, with many very big improvements going into production now. Even at current cost levels, TCO is lower. 600k mile lifetime is more likely with electric, and might require a likely $10k+ in transmission, fuel systems, engine maintenance on ICE. At 25mpg (camry level fuel efficiency), requires 24000 gallons of gas to drive that far. At $3/gallon, $72k lifetime. 200Mwh at current renewable electricity generation rate (going down not up) of $30/Mwh costs $6k in fuel for lifetime. Even quintupling electricity costs, means a free leaf or bolt after operating costs. Carbon taxes are going to come eventually, and that means even higher gasoline costs over the car's lifetime. An EV furthermore has a fantastic synergy with residential or grid renewables (on or off grid) providing backup or simply smart metered cheaper home use rates and EV charging rates. The Nissan Leaf already has this functionality. A key effect on a renewable economy is that there has to be surpluses generated when its very sunny/windy, and storage systems are needed to balance the cost/availability. Batteries pay for themselves for utilitiies and consumers by letting them absorb surplus energy (sometimes sold at negative rates today, but sure to stay below cost or below 3c/kwh) in order to offset (or sell if utility) 6c+/kwh energy when demand exceeds supply.

Given more time to consider it I may have chosen a city not in recent memory, but I still freely chose from a multitude of options. What I did notice however is that I elucidated cities in recent memory before those in distant memory. There was this first moment when I said pick a city and there was this hiatus where nothing has occurred to you, and then the names of cities start to get promoted into consciousness for reasons you can't inspect. See to me that sounds an awful lot like the brain assembling a list of most familiar cities in recent memory or experience from which to freely choose.

You also start to approach unsavory levels of social engineering when you look broadly at one gender's choices (saying, prioritizing quality of life over marginally higher income) and decide that it's a decision that we must socialize out of them from an early age by isolating the factors likely to enable/promote that preference and 'address' them.

On the other hand, our military forces are still stationed in Iraq, which has about 15-20% Kurdish population. That is literally right next door to Syria. ",t3_a83hwh,neutralnews

"I believe a ruined career is worse than sexual harrassment. Worse than being touched inappropriately. I disagree. I was sexually harassed by the director of my old job. He would try to kiss me on the mouth at work functions, would hold my hand at work, rub my shoulders, would send me flirtatious emails. I ignored him, pulled away etc. I reported him 3 times. I ended up getting transferred and then fired as a result. He continued to work there for several years. I will never forget how small and horrible he made me feel, i will never forget how powerless my husband (boyfriend at the time, who also worked in the same place) felt. After i was fired, I came to find out that a significant number of female employees had a '4 foot rule' with him and ending up quitting as a result of his behavior. It has been 10 years i still shudder when i think about him. I highly doubt he has ever thought about any of us. ETA as a result of complaints, all employees were required to attend a sexual harassment seminar. The director was exempt. My story is not unique. Most women I know i have been sexually harassed at work. Many of them were punished for reporting it. ",t3_a2oqlf,neutralnews

"I honestly wasn't able to find more targeted data, unfortunately. I'm mostly inferring there's more danger to senior people from accusation (relative to harassment) from how commonly sexual harassment comes from supervisors. There is hard data to support that. The Wikipedia article on the subject quotes it at 51% but their source link is dead. Senior employees and management therefore probably does not share the same risk profile as the general population. The higher up you are, the fewer coworkers you have that are your supervisor, or even your peer at a certain level. So the less exposure you have to danger. Your risk profile may start to not look like that of a regular employee. As an example: the bookkeeper at a lumberyard. Looking at 'lumberyard workplace injury rates' and applying them to the bookkeeper is going to produce some questionably accurate data. I was basically responding with data of similar quality to show that there is some reason to believe that not all claims of sexual harassment are substantiated. It's sub-optimal but better than nothing. I do not correlate lack of evidence with false accusation. It's the category that includes that. It also includes all cases where the person got away with it for lack of evidence, cases where it was a genuine misinterpretation of actions or words on the part of the person making the accusation, cases of mistaken identity, uninvolved parties mistakenly pushing for an investigation on the behalf of a coworker, and any number of other scenarios. Perception of avoidable risk is what drives decision making, and **the result to the accused is the same no matter how innocent or malicious the intent.** I almost always like to see more studies, as long as they're not being used to refuse to act when there's already enough information to form a call for action.

One of many, many replies: Some commenters who argue that the Title II Order’s revised definitions should be maintained point to Congress’s delegation of interpretational authority to the Commission and the Commission’s previous position that it could define the public switched network based on new technology and consumer demand.289 In defining the terms “public switched network” and “interconnected service” in the Second CMRS Report and Order, however, the Commission recognized that commercial mobile service must still be interconnected with the local exchange or interexchange switched network, and it stated that “any switched common carrier service that is interconnected with the traditional local exchange or interexchange switched network will be defined as part of that network for purposes of our definition of ‘commercial mobile radio services.’”290 Further, although the Title II Order found that the revised definitions adopted at that time were warranted as better reflecting current technological developments, including the “rapidly growing and virtually universal use of mobile broadband service” and the “universal access provided . . . by and to mobile broadband,” the Commission expressly noted that its determination was “a policy judgment that section 332(d) expressly delegated to the Commission, consistent with its broad spectrum management authority under Title III.”291 We find that this analysis places undue weight on the wide availability of a mobile service, as being effectively available to a substantial portion of the public is merely one of the definitional criteria.",t3_a3iicz,neutralnews

"A) You are incorrect. Illegal entry does not bar asylum applications Here is  (1) In general. - Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 235(b). B) So many things - The Muriel boatlift migrants weren't prisoners in cuba - China is not going to send Uighurs here. You won't be able to find a single serious china analyst suggesting that. - If they did send them here it would be an act of great moral value for the US to take them because they are being put in to internment camps in China and are having significant human rights abuses committed against them by the Chinese government. Comparing either of these two groups to a bunch of dangerous criminals is repugnant. like persecuted Yazidis and christians I hope the US allows more of these refugees to come here, I welcome them with open arms and would advocate for policies that made it easier for them to come here.

Those would be the government contractors of which I was one at the time and can confirm that no one within the company I worked, nor others I associated with received back pay. That's the life of a contractor and as you can see, there were no hard/fast numbers on contractors but if you think for minute 'oh there are only a couple hundred'* you need to think again. In addition to the federal employees and contractors, associated businesses were also adversely affected. Jobs like, parking and transportation, food services, etc. In particular in the DC area, since you obviously do not live here you have not idea how big of an impact shuttering the government has on a local economy.

"You make a lot of good points here. To your last point, I personally believe the networking aspect is even more valuable than you've given it credit for here. I think most of humanity's great works from all vocations come from like-minded groups of people challenging one another and creating (to some degree) collectively. It's a belief that comes across as a bit 'woo,' I know. I don't know that that's impossible to achieve in an online group setting, though. Same goes for writing papers and having them torn apart by trusted peers. It would be difficult to curate, but I don't think it's the exclusive domain of a traditional classroom. Another point you've made that I somewhat question is the notion of a demanding pace being an objective good. I feel like most of the STEM students I've known probably would have benefited immensely from their workload being spread out to some degree. The courseloads too often drive people to a mental breaking point, in my experience. Of course, if you're working towards a particular degree for a job, especially if you're looking at a PhD, condensing your education seems pretty appealing. I like the idea of education being an end in itself rather than just a means to an end, so I appreciate the idea of an education that can coexist with a job and life. Do you think there's something about a demanding pace that creates a deeper understanding of subject matter, or do you think you could learn as robustly if a year's worth of schooling instead took 1.5 or 2? Access to educational programs is certainly a benefit of formal schooling, but there are free alternatives to many programs, and there's usually an option to purchase or subscribe to others for a fee if you're not a student, though the student discounts are usually quite substantial. Access to a full suite of software along with instruction on its use is immensely valuable, though, I agree. I'm just also of the opinion that most educational software and programs should be more acessible to the general public, and it seems like educational institutions resist that notion, which I think is to the detriment of society. The labs you mentioned are the aspect I'm least familiar with, though I can see how certain topics would absolutely demand hands-on learning. I guess the question at that point becomes whether the labs could become available on their own for a fee that's independent of a full syllabus, perhaps in line with proof of free online course completion and/or testing to gain access? Or do you think that's wholly impractical?",t3_a1wkdc,neutralnews

The applicants in that case challenged the lawfulness of the European Central Bank buying govt bonds issued by euro states, and a preliminary reference was made. Similarly to the Article 50 case, the relevant action of buying the bond had not actually occurred. There was, however, a policy that shares would be bought where four criteria were met. The meeting of these criteria was also a probability. In contrast, there is no current policy that revocation might be sought in any circumstances.

However, if that is the solution then we can draw two reasonable conclusions from that snippet of information: 1. The issue of bad behavior was caused by lack of nutrition, and though the author excludes the income levels of the families of the students receiving this breakfast, from the rest of the article it can be reasonably inferred that they were low income. 2. The race of the students had no bearing on the outcome. The students remained the same, the teachers remained the same. It wasn't an issue of race, it was income and the variety of problems which attend poverty.

"“if we have societal issues regarding the mass genocide of a race, economic disparity, and sprawling illiteracy, how do we address them holistically?” Respectfully, if we have issues with dragons taking maidens how do we address this? Etc. Historically, progressives/left supported eugenics, fascism, segregation, etc. These were all examples of social engineering/human experimentation. Of course most current progressives don't support these types of things, but the methodology is the same. Currently in the modern west races aren't at risk of genocide. Economic disparity isn't a problem (it's a result of scarcity) not to mention modern nations have intervened in all markets/industries for decades/a century. As for illiteracy, I don't think this is a big problem either. The point is economies, education, et al have been run by progressives or along progressive ideologies for a long time. Given this track record and earlier results, fascism et al, why on earth would anyone support progressive methodologies. And again, the consist of social engineering/human experimentation.

"One might argue that one side, at least on its surface, is meant to support the American worker, while the other essentially exists to exploit labor as much as possible. No. One might argue that both sides should be supporting the American people, and not one faction over another. There's a massive issue in this country with wage stagnation and the decline of purchasing power of the American people. Which is a symptom of larger more complex problems that probably have less to do with labour and capital and more to do with short-sighted policy decisions, no matter how well intended. There are also serious issues coming as automation becomes cheaper and performs better. Having someone who, again at least on the surface, represents the workforce is something we all should agree on. Agreed. New technologies are disruptive. We shouldn’t advocate wide spread adoption of new technologies until we are able to understand and adjust for their consequences. Driverless vehicles could devastate the trucking industry. Put in other words, driverless vehicles could eliminate one of the highest paying jobs for high-school educated males. Society needs to be ready for that. This is something very few people, and no politicians I know of, are really talking about. And I doubt that many would like the solution, which would probably involve strict government control on emerging tech. Having someone who, again at least on the surface, represents the workforce is something we all should agree on Disagree. We’ve had decades of pandering politicians who are for x “on the surface”. First, if they are for x “on the surface” then they are unprincipled and are not to be trusted. They are for sale to the highest bidder. Second, they view every problem as a discrete issue to be solved in whatever way maximizes utility from likely voters. The result has been decades of government that throw debt-secured money at every possible fucking problem so they can be seen “doing something” by likely voters while ignoring the long term repercussions of their policies. I want politicians who can find the least socially-disruptive solution to a problem while attempting to account for second and third order effects. Unless you're a big fan of revolutions, ignoring the workers and reducing their ability to speak isn't ever going to end well. Disagree in part. Failing to recognize that society is an ecosystem that has to be kept in relative balance will lead to revolution (i.e. workers and executives need to work together instead of constantly looking out for their own best interests). Failing to reassess our own policy assumptions will hasten that revolution. Continuing to throw money at every discrete problem like debt-drunk idiots will lead to ruin. Succumbing to blatantly partisan and divisive messaging will hasten that ruin. Junior Senators sat down at a meeting with CEOs. Which is appropriate. A junior Senator notices that there were no labor leaders at this meeting. What a great chance to rile up that base. The headline writes itself. For all any of us know, they attended a meeting with labour leaders a week later. I’m not asserting such a meeting took place. Im pointing out that society reacts to the information it is given and to the context in which it is presented. Particularly if that information confirms biases. Im not advocating that the moderate position is the best, that compromise is always the solution, or that Rs and/or Ds are always right and/or wrong. I am saying that electing politicians who are looking out for the best interest of America as a whole is preferable to electing unprincipled politicians who look out for their party’s interests, their self-interest, and/or the “best interest” of certain Americans.

I was and am proud to have even the slightest kinship with them, but I have never used that small amount of ancestry to take opportunities away from actual Native Americans. **details out her scholorships, etc. and how she got them for reasons other than any claim to Native American blood** I decided to participate in a dna analysis to see if my family stories had been correct; and frankly because I found that President Trump calling me 'little pocahontas' was demeaning to me because I knew my NA ancestry was small, but even more demeaning to the NA community. Pocahontas is an NA historical figure and she should be treated as one, not used as a derogatory nickname. The dna test did prove that I have a small amount of NA ancestry, but no more than many other Americans. So, I've learned that relying on science rather than family stories is the best way to go. I humbly apologize to all NA people who were offended by my statements. I realize now that having a NA ancestor somewhere back in your ancestry has nothing to do with being a member of one of the proud, strong NA tribes of today. I can say that this experience has made me much more aware of needs, etc. of the NA community - and other marginalized communities as well. I am going to take this experience and use it as an opportunity to **blah blah do better for everyone blah blah**. Thanks for listening, Elizabeth Warren.'

Critics of vaccination have taken a variety of positions, including opposition to the smallpox vaccine in England and the United States in the mid to late 1800s, and the resulting anti-vaccination leagues; as well as more recent vaccination controversies such as those surrounding the safety and efficacy of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) immunization, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the use of a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal.'

"The problem is, the definition provided by the White House of what constitutes a 'wall' has changed over time. There's a huge cost difference between low and high estimates depending on what you build where. The other issue is the $5 billion estimate for 215 miles might not be accurate. Former DHS Secretary John Kelly's testified to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee back in April 2017 and said “There is no way I can give the committee an estimate of how much this will cost. I mean, I don’t know what it will be made of, I don’t know how high it will be, I don’t know if it is going to have solar panels on its side, what one side is going to look like, how it will be painted. I have no idea. So I can’t give you any type of an estimate.”  compiled the estimated costs from various sources and they vary wildly: The costs for these wall prototypes are estimated at between $200,000 and $500,000 but the costs for the entire border wall remain unclear. Trump has estimated that it would total $12 billion, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell put the upper bound at $15 billion, an internal DHS report suggested $21 billion (a number that Trump tweeted would come down), Bernstein Research put it at $25 billion after evaluating construction materials’ fluctuating prices, an MIT article claimed $29 billion (for a wall that is 30 feet tall, goes 6 feet underground, and spans 1,000 miles), and Senator Claire McCaskill’s office estimated $67 billion (using the Trump administration’s FY2018 budget request’s proposed $36.6 million per border wall mile and extrapolating it to the entire border).",t3_a8d5ih,neutralnews

The narrative is that women are victims of employers who are taking advantage of them and that we need to convince employers to pay women more. In quite a few discussions of this kind I consistently see the trope of a man coming along and saying something akin to 'get a degree in X engineering' and that is met with silence or something like 'I shouldn't have to.' What's more, to be frank, academia has been spinning its wheels on this issue since the 70s when women really were routinely discriminated against when they had the same or better qualifications than men and were competing directly with men for non-blue collar jobs.

The great lakes alone are 850 cubic miles which converts to  of water. We'd have to know more about how many watersheds have seasonal water ways that will not be protected. It's a very near sighted way of viewing that as regardless of whether that river is dry or flowing the water that lands on it is mostly washed down hill to other rivers or large bodies of water. Realistically if the great lakes alone hold nearly a Quadrillion US gallons of water we need to understand that is the static volume it holds and does not help us understand the rate of water entering and exiting the lakes. Let's go seriously low on the estimate and say that the entire US watershed (including much more than standing bodies) only sees two times that of the great lakes and round up to 2 Quadrillion US gallons. In order for millions of gallons of water to be contaminated then the unprotected waterways only need to make up 0.0000001% of the overall US watershed. &#x200B; I'm confused how someone can be so sure about their position (that this is simply environmentalists being alarmists) yet everyone has to explain the details to them. ,t3_a5icdp,neutralnews

"LA Times interview of John Kelly. Other coverage from the . Some choice bits: In the phone interview Friday, Kelly defended his rocky tenure, arguing that it is best measured by what the president did not do when Kelly was at his side. >It was only after Kelly’s departure was confirmed Dec. 8, for example, that Trump abruptly announced the pullout of all U.S. troops from Syria and half the 14,000 troops from Afghanistan, two moves that Kelly had opposed. >Kelly’s supporters say he stepped in to block or divert the president on dozens of matters large and small. They credit him, in part, for persuading Trump not to pull U.S. forces out of South Korea, or withdraw from NATO, as he had threatened. ... But Trump never ordered him to do anything illegal, Kelly stressed, “because we wouldn’t have.” “If he had said to me, ‘Do it, or you’re fired,’” Kelly said he would have resigned. ... “To be honest, it’s not a wall,” Kelly said. When Kelly led Homeland Security in early 2017, one of his first steps was to seek advice from those who “actually secure the border,” Customs and Border Protection agents who Kelly calls “salt-of-the-earth, Joe-Six-Pack folks.” “They said, ‘Well we need a physical barrier in certain places, we need technology across the board, and we need more people,’” he said. “The president still says ‘wall’ — oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing,’ now he’s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.” ... “Illegal immigrants, overwhelmingly, are not bad people,” Kelly said, describing many migrants as victims misled by traffickers. “I have nothing but compassion for them, the young kids.” ... On Saturday, Trump blamed Democrats for the deaths of the two migrant children this month. He also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to Central America if another reported migrant caravan isn’t stopped. Kelly didn’t respond to Trump’s threats directly but suggested part of the problem lies on the U.S. side of the border. “If you want to stop illegal immigration, stop U.S. demand for drugs, and expand economic opportunity” in Central America, he said. ... >Kelly said Sessions’ announcement caught the White House by surprise. >“What happened was Jeff Sessions, he was the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained and the family separation,” Kelly said. “He surprised us.” >The chaotic implementation then fell primarily on the Department of Health and Human Services and Nielsen, who came under fire for standing on the White House podium and saying there was no policy of separating families. >“She is a good soldier; she took the face shot,” a senior White House official said on background. “No one asked her to do it, but by the time we could put together a better strategy, she’d already owned it.” ... Asked why he stayed 18 months in the White House, despite policy differences, personality clashes, the punishing schedule, and a likely lasting association with some of Trump’s controversies, he said simply: duty. “Military people,” he said, “don’t walk away.” ",t3_aay50o,neutralnews

Commission regulations provide a test, called the “irrespective test,” to differentiate legitimate campaign and officeholder expenses from personal expenses. Under the “irrespective test,” personal use is any use of funds in a campaign account of a candidate (or former candidate) to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the candidate’s campaign or responsibilities as a federal officeholder. More simply, if the expense would exist even in the absence of the candidacy or even if the officeholder were not in office, then the personal use ban applies. Conversely, any expense that results from campaign or officeholder activity falls outside the personal use ban. You can read more specifics here: ",t3_a64on9,neutralnews

"It doesn't have to be a single issue thing, but lets say that cutting off planned parenthood from government money is the issue from your example. So if that is a large concern to me and they say we will not vote for a bill that includes funding for PP, even if we have to shut down the government, then it would be in my favor and one of the reasons that I voted in that politician. The shutdown doesn't usually last that long anyways, so it isn't like nothing can ever be done, it just gets postponed a week or two. It really isn't a huge deal, they just make it seem that way and the news channels get to throw up that shutdown timer and act like the sky is falling. In reality all the essential things keep going and only minor things stop. Congress could always vote to fund things individually. Why not create a separate bill for the border wall and vote?

Mr. Trump has been involved with campaign finance issues for decades, donating to candidates as a real-estate developer, extending them loans and hosting fundraisers for them, according to federal and state campaign finance records and testimony he gave in 1988 to the New York State Commission on Government Integrity. In that testimony, Mr. Trump demonstrated an awareness of the federal contribution limits at the time and spoke at length about his views on campaign finance. “I have gone through federal campaigns, and frankly it’s the best thing that ever happened to me because you’re limited to a thousand-dollar contribution,” he said.

If a company had to pay a multimillion dollar fine for hiring undocumented immigrants, it would remove the incentive for people to immigrate without following the appropriate procedures, it would likely raise wages for low income workers, and it would punish the people who are truly benefitting from the current system (employers who pay people under the table).

"So, my understanding is that bump stocks work by not actually requiring you to pull the trigger for each bullet fired by essentially having the trigger push itself against your finger. That understanding is correct. Given this, it seems to me that a limitation based on firing rate per motion of the finger would solve the problem because it would make bump stocks illegal as many bullets are fired without the trigger finger having to move but merely being able to shoot fast would not be illegal if you were able to do it by having trained your trigger finger to move quickly. I'm not sure how mechanically viable slowing down the action of the firearm would be. Semi-auto firearms typically have springs that return the bolt to battery. This happens fairly quickly - more quickly than most people could shoot without practice.  Weakening this spring to try lengthening this time might cause the firearm to become less reliable.
