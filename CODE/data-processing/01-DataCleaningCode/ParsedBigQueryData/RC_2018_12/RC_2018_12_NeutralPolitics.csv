"No, I’m making a qualitative distinction between the process of levying tax and how that tax is spent which your argument doesn’t address. The government determines the price at which it can charge businesses to stay in the US than go abroad. Businesses pay that for the luxury of doing business under the legal protections offered by the US than say Ireland which has a substantially lower corporate tax rate. The government then has an amount of funding which it can choose to spend however it pleases. Currently, it spends a significant amount on public resources, but there’s nothing stopping the government from voting to defund everything that isn’t constitutionally required and just sitting on the money. I do not choose where my taxes go. Neither do you or any business. If I or you or a business would choose to leave to go elsewhere, the government could not prevent you from doing so which they would be able to if they had an ownership stake. Furthermore, the idea of “ownership” is undermined by the unequal relationship between parties - a business has no choice in the matter should it want to conduct business in the US. The US can choose to levy as large or little of a tax as they want and a business must comply or dissolve. I hesitate to presume that the vast majority of businesses have a stakeholder who singlehandedly can dissolve the ownership of every other stakeholder should they so choose.",t3_a0boei,NeutralPolitics

"Best top-level comment. Notably, one of the few that actually shows any interest on what Puerto Ricans want—not something that Americans are known for. I still think some things need to be addressed: Puerto Rican status referendum of 1998: 46.5 percent of voters choose statehood while 50.2 percent, voted for 'none of the above'. The government at the time chose not to include the current territorial status as a option and after supporters protested they settled by including 'none of the above' along with independence. This is inaccurate. The (pro-statehood) administration at the time **refused** to include a 'none of the above' option. The Puerto Rican Supreme Court forced them to put it into the ballot. Oh, and after 'none of the above' won, the administration tried to illegally take over the certification of results (which falls to the independent elections commission) and put out illegal election results that (a) counted the 'none of the above' votes as blank/invalid ballots, and (b) excluded those from the calculation of the percentages, and thus (c) listed statehood as winning with more than 90% of the vote. The courts again shot that down. The 1998 referendum is an important moment in Puerto Rican political history to understand, because it's the time when the statehooders decided that they didn't actually want to win in a fair referendum, but rather rig it to engineer a fake 'win' for statehood. That pattern has repeated itself ever after. Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012: A two part referendum was proposed [...] The passive voice here and the verb 'proposed' conceals the agency. Rather, the statehooders unilaterally imposed that referendum. In 1998 the local supreme court and the elections commission served as a check on the statehooders' ability to rig the referendum, as I mentioned above. Well, in the intervening years the statehooders managed to exploit the divided government of the 2004-2008 years (PPD governor, PNP legislature) to steal seats in these—much like the GOP just recently stole the Garland seat, except the PNP stole several seats. Gov. Fortuño (2009-2012) appointed **six out of nine** of the current members of that court. The 2012 referendum couldn't have been held in that form otherwise. Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017: this on was characterized by a very low turnout, just 23 percent of the eligible voters and 97% chose statehood (about 500,000 votes). Doing quick math, these 500,000 represent just 22.3% of the eligible voters. 2017 is best understood as a replay of 1998 but without the 'none of the above' ballot option. The autonomists executed the boycott they were planning in 1998, which back then they abandoned when the court required the administration to add the 'none of the above' to the ballot. Note that the 1998 and 2012 results underscore that this boycott is extremely credible. The 2017 boycotters are the same factions that got a simple majority in 1998 for 'none of the above.' They could credibly have similarly won either in 2012 or 2017 if the referendum wasn't rigged. The statehooders rigged those referendums *precisely* so that their very credible, organized opponents would be disenfranchised. The constitution is clear that congress has plenary powers to decide about new states (Article 4, Section 3): [...] Translation: 'The USA rules absolutely over Puerto Rico because they say so and no other reason.' Let's not pretend that any nation has the right to own another one and rule tyrannically over it for 120+ years. Your vaunted constitution can't possibly justify such a thing. I honestly sympathize with this line of thinking, because in a democracy you can chose not to participate in an election (as millions regularly do in U.S.) and nobody questions their legitimacy. In a democracy there is some sort of supermajority agreement (e.g., a constitution) that spells out how elections are to be held. And elections are organized in ways such that they actually reflect the will of the people. For example: 1. The government doesn't get to unilaterally decide which candidates for office can appear on the ballot; the government *must* put any candidate on the ballot who meets certain reasonable qualifications. 2. When there's a vote to enact a proposition, there's a 'no' or 'none of the above' option that allows voters to cleanly reject the proposition; it's usually not 'here's option A and option B, and screw you if you disagree with both, the minority that supports one of the two will impose on the majority that opposes both.' Those sorts of considerations are why the 1998, 2012 and 2017 referendums are illegitimate. That's why the pro-Puerto Rico factions have often resorted to boycotts. But note that they haven't *always* resorted to such, in particular, in 1998 they managed to prevail on placing a 'none of the above' on the ballot, and **got a majority to back that**. However, as it is our congress who decides if Puerto Rico becomes a state or not we have to give a lot of weight to the fact that Puerto Ricans are not endorsing this option when they have the opportunity to do so. As I implied above, I don't agree with the implicit premise here that the USA has the right to unilaterally make Puerto Rico into a state. Would you say, for example, that Congress could tomorrow decide that Québec is a state? The USA doesn't have a legitimate right to rule over Canadian territory. Or Puerto Rican territory. As long as the U.S. exists in its current form, statehood is forever; there is no way out once you are in. Again, try applying this argument to a hypothetical act of Congress admitting Québec as a state. If the 'admission' is invalid in the first place, this 'statehood is forever' argument doesn't matter.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"This goes beyond social media and is a symptom of increasing time spent interacting with technology in general instead of in-person social groups. Robert Putnam's 2000 book Bowling Alone and associated  makes the case for this very well. He argues that the US has seen a severe decline of fraternal, civic, and social organizations including church membership, union activities, volunteer organizations, PTA groups, Scouting, and yes, bowling leagues. The author identifies technology and the ability to entertain oneself without face-to-face interaction or social interaction as a key ingredient in this decline. Since 2000 these opportunities have only grown - think of how often Americans today would rather watch Netflix at home instead of visiting a film screening at their local library. What are the consequences of declining social organizations? Per Putnam, it limits our 'Social Capital' and thus our trust in one another: Americans are also less trusting. The proportion of Americans saying that most people can be trusted fell by more than a third between 1960, when 58 percent chose that alternative, and 1993, when only 37 percent did. The same trend is apparent in all educational groups; indeed, because social trust is also correlated with education and because educational levels have risen sharply, the overall decrease in social trust is even more apparent if we control for education. This is an important ingredient in our current political climate. It is much easier to seriously hate and 'other' your political opponents when you are only acquainted with them through the news or social media, and when your ability to trust - or see disagreements as honest - is low. Anecdotally, the most politically moderate and least hateful people I know in life are very engaged in volunteer and civic organizations. I can't help but think that their in-person, social exposure to a variety of different people helps give them a worldview that is less hostile and more civil than our current norm.",t3_a3i7ai,NeutralPolitics

"Enforcement of that rule is one of the main things that makes this a good sub, but you are enforcing it in a weird way in this particular case. You're asking for a link to the definition of a term, which while nice, shouldn't really be considered something that needs citing. Same goes for him stating that a judicial hierarchy exists or that the US Constitution is the supreme legal source. Those aren't really debatable things, they're pretty much axioms. I know the rules say 'Statements of fact must cite qualified sources' and 'nothing is common knowledge' but certain things have to be taken as a given. It doesn't make sense to require a source for a fact that is not really debatable. If you say that the Supreme Court is the top court in the United States, do you have to give a source for that too? The sources you asked for were pretty much the same as asking for a source for that. Not to say that he didn't need sources for his comment. He did, but it wasn't the ones you were asking for. Like this part: The relevant portions are not authoritative statements of law. Rather, they are “dicta” (“obiter dicta” if you’re fancy), meaning that they’re non-binding expressions of opinion incidental to the legal issue(s) at hand. They often reflect the judge’s own outlook and philosophy, but they do not create precedent. They’re more or less judicial packing peanuts - they surround a decision’s essential holdings and reasoning, but they’re dispensable. Instead of a definition for the word 'dicta' it would make way more sense to provide a source showing that these statements were dicta rather than authoritative or a source showing how the rulings are legally binding but not the opinions. I guess my point is that requiring sources makes this sub great, but sometimes the way you enforce it doesn't make a ton of sense. Particularly in cases where the statements of fact are more axiomatic than debatable. Maybe the rule would make more sense if it said 'Statements of fact that could be reasonably questioned must cite qualified sources.' As written, the rule would require people to source every minor claim, even things as simple as who the current president is.",t3_a77mum,NeutralPolitics

"Late to this party. As to your question regarding foreign policy and the DOD, SECDEF Mattis was instrumental in writing the new National Defense Strategy:  Unfortunately, only the unclassified summary is available for the the public. The gist of it is: * Refocus on countering conventional near-peer foes (i.e. China and Russia) * Rebuilding a military that spent time fighting insurgents back to deterring and countering said adversaries * Reorganizing forces for said purposes Obviously I cant share with you classified details, but the impact is immediate. For instance: * The Navy reactivated its Second Fleet  with 40+ nations in the world. Note that he says we must use ALL our tools. Not just military might, not just economic bullying, but use everything - like diplomacy. (He famously said in 2013 if we don't fully fund the State Department, he'd have to buy more bullets - he knows quite well what happens) >Similarly, **I believe we must be *resolute and unambiguous* in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies.** That is why we must use **all the tools of American power** to provide for the common defense. Again, he states very clearly that he knows that Russia and China seek to fight our dominance in world affairs. Trump, openly praising Russia and China while casting aside our alliances with democratic nations in Europe and around the world, is openly destroying that. And once again, he says 'all the tools' - he knows it's more than just having a big military budget that we need to counter growing Russian and Chinese influence. >**My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues.** We must do everything possible to **advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values,** *and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.* That's a pretty big slam on Trump, the outsider: four decades of experience, versus a businessman-turned-reality TV celebrity. And again, he knows that we need a system that aids us in our security, which means also being a defender of our values. >**Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position**. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, **a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February.** Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department. The bold parts say it all. Also, he basically said that his last day is after your next possible chance at screwing up NATO and the military in front of Congress. >I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people. >I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform. Very proud to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform... but not the President. That's a HUGE slam at the end. He basically said, without outright insulting his boss, that: * I believe in our alliances with friendly nations, you don't * I believe in opposing Russia and China who seek to overturn the Western model of governance in the world, you don't * Our common defense is best done by keeping those alliances, you don't want to keep those alliances, so you're not as interested in actually defending us * We have to be clear on our opposition to those forces, you waffle or even undermine our views * Since you continue to disagree with all that, I'm resigning And it's incredibly telling that this letter was released to the public: it's not just for Trump to read, it's for ALL Americans to read. I also want to point out some of the 'political genius' that Mattis did in writing this letter, for a guy who doesn't involve himself in politics: * It is concrete proof of his intentions, and can't be construed as 'media bias' against Trump * It is unambiguous in the difference in values he has with his boss, i.e. he lays out Trump's values clearly without having to say it directly * He also says that he is resigning in February AFTER the NATO meeting and after Congress meets with him - meaning if Trump fires him now, it will look extra bad - but gets one last swing at keeping Trump from doing damage Seriously though, Mattis has done what every good leader in the military does: insulate his subordinates from the whims and bad orders of their superiors.

"I would doubt that any line item in the DoD would be a good fit for the border wall. Fundamentally, border security is not the responsibility of the military. The military's function is outlined in USC Title 10. I certainly haven't read it, but based on other comments I've gathered that border security and similar functions aren't covered. For example, I know military personnel that have seen people crossing the border on military ranges, but are legally unable to do anything other than notify border patrol. I suspect that border security has its own title somewhere, but I don't know where it is. DHS is likely similarly funded to the DoD. I am sure that they have line items more in-line with 'build the wall' than anything in the DoD, but they probably lack the funds in those items to do anything significant. Another factor that's at issue is the fact that most of the money in these line items is already allocated. Getting money from Congress literally takes years - for example, in the DoD, you can't realistically effect even FY20 budget at this point. While that money hasn't been spent, everyone has a very solid idea of where its going. Again, it's really challenging to reprogram dollars and do something else with them. I'm very doubtful that Trump would be able to move around enough money to do anything substantial with the wall. Congress isn't on board and it's really, really challenging to move that much money around any of the executive agencies.",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

There is already a 0% rate of tax for willing a portion of your estate to a 501(c)3 organization. Perhaps a similar provision could be created to allow a low-tax way to will this massive wealth in excess of $50 million to a taxpayer's publicly traded corporation, if their wealth is in a nature similar to Bezos' or Gates'. This way business giants like those two would not be discouraged from creating value for their corporations' shareholders, and could allow their legacy to live on by transferring their wealth in excess of the high tax rate back into the corporation itself at death. The value this would have for their minority shareholders would be immense.

The current population of Puerto Rico is a very uncertain number right now, because the statistical methods used to estimate it between censuses break down with the massive depopulation that has happened to the island in the past 10 years and that the hurricane accelerated. >Recent estimates put the population at various points between 3.0 and 3.3 million. After the hurricane (Sep. 20, 2017) some 200-300K fled, so the population seems to have dipped from about 3.0 million by Dec. 2017 or Jan. 2018, then recovered somewhat with a wave of returnees for the next few months, and then started shedding population again. That still puts it about ~2,400,000 heads over Wyoming... >And there's another argument against statehood: it would probably result in even more mass displacement of Puerto Rico's population, to be replaced by Americans. Think of the sorry lot of native Hawaiians or Chicanos, who were basically turned into foreigners on their own ancestral homelands; that's what would happen to Puerto Ricans.

This was also nothing to do with the 'will' of the government, since the government do not have the power to abrogate the laws of the land with impunity. And in this case, the law was clear. , which states: (1)When a court determines any question with respect to— (a)the upbringing of a child; or (b)the administration of a child’s property or the application of any income arising from it, the child’s welfare shall be the court’s paramount consideration. (2) In any proceedings in which any question with respect to the upbringing of a child arises, the court shall have regard to the general principle that any delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child.

"Thanks for the long respond; I'm on the east coast and ready to go to work and I can't reciprocate by addressing all your points because I simply don't have the time now. However, I will address a few points: * I'm well aware of the local politics and the maneuvers by the pro-statehood faction; I actually lived 22 years in Puerto Rico and was there for the 1993 and 1998 referendum. But I didn't need to include those details to illustrate the fact that statehood is not the option favored by the majority of islanders. The numbers speak for themselves notwithstanding the wishful thinking of the pro-statehood political 'leaders'. Regarding this: Translation: 'The USA rules absolutely over Puerto Rico because they say so and no other reason.' Let's not pretend that any nation has the right to own another one and rule tyrannically over it for 120+ years. Your vaunted constitution can't possibly justify such a thing. In my 22 years on the island I didn't see American soldiers on the street preventing Puerto Ricans from becoming an independent nation or voting for statehood. The FBI is not going around like a secret police arresting locals that want independence. As the results of the various referendums attest, the locals have been unable to decide for themselves for any option that will replace the current territorial status. Are the USA conspiring in any way to prevent Puerto Ricans from abandoning the current territorial status? In what way are the USA ruling Puerto Rico 'tyrannically'? Puerto Ricans never made a serious attempt at independence from Spain, who was a worse ruler than the USA and acted like savages in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. In fact, Puerto Ricans troops loyal to the Spanish crown fought [in the second war of Dominican independence] ( from 1863 to 1865. So what are the Americans supposed to do? They could unilaterally declare the island independence as the same constitution quoted above clearly states that congress has the power to do whatever the hell they want.

"I think he means the small population as being the 26 smallest states overriding a super majority of the population. And I would say this is a legitimate concern given: 1. that a president that lost the popular vote nominated two justices 2. that both justices were confirmed by senators representing the minority of the country. 3. which makes the supreme court's recent tendency to go 5-4 splits become a decision won by the minority 4. causing a full-circle minority rule, instead of just the senate. 5. which makes this not a representative democracy, but an oligarchy of a ruling minority class (using 'class' loosely)  &#x200B; And to be clear, while this is a republic, or a representative democracy, that doesn't negate the concept of Majority rule, especially when it relates to the actual election of representatives. The core 2 concepts of a democracy should be Majority rule, Minority rights. This means, namely that: 1. All Decisions are made on a majority vote 2. But untouchable rights are laid out to protect the minority, usually in the form of a bill of rights (and given that you can't predict which way the minority will end up being, you have these rights cover everyone.) 3.

">However, the Senate is not an example of localized power. It necessarily performs acts which control the country at large. Same with the Presidency. I see no reason why a minority of people should have a disproportionate amount of control in deciding on national-level policies. You say you fear 'tyranny of the majority,' but when the alternative is 'tyranny of the minority,' I can't say I'm a fan. In the European Parliament, seats are weighted such that Germany has the least per capita, and the smallest countries the most. That's the equivalent to the US *House of Representatives.* The countries are further represented by their heads of state in the council and one member of the Commission each. Many proposals can be blocked by a single veto of any country. Is that system 'unfair' towards Germany? Depends. They are under-represented, yet trying to remove these minority protections would widely be seen as giving the already overly powerful Germans unacceptable electoral power. Obviously, the US is much further on the continuum of centralized statehood than the EU. But the individual states demanded a certain degree of sovereignty, egalitarian representation be damned, to join. 'If you don't like our rules, leave our union and make your own!' they might say. I believe your principle disagreement here is tgat you see the US as a singular nation with one people and don't understand why not everyone should have equal electoral representation in all regards, while opponents see the USA as a union of states with certain sovereign rights they can insist upon. A union that historically only came about because the smaller states have special protections, without which they might have never joined, or want to remain.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"I certainly agree that a person living paycheck to paycheck has limited options, and formidable challenges: The less money they have: The less likely they are to get good financial advice, or even realize they need it. The more critical their financial decisions become. The less confidence they have in their financial future. The easier it is to give up whatever plans they previously made, and blow any money they do have. However, even someone who is living paycheck to paycheck can strive to become financially literate, and start thinking about money the way a rich person does (as a means to make more money, rather than a resource to dissipate in the pursuit of temporary comfort or status), and start reading financial self-help books at a public library. This way, if they do happen to get some money (either through cost-cutting, or a windfall), they can spend it wisely. Here are some links describing people who became intentionally homeless, to save on housing costs:  I would not recommend this particular technique for everyone, especially those with children, but it demonstrates a creative way to save thousands per year. This is one example of living well beneath one's means, to accumulate savings, which can be used to for investment in vocational training, education, real estate, or other business opportunities.",t3_a4ofkq,NeutralPolitics

"The right to move between states doesn’t apply differently whether you cross the border on a public road or anywhere else. It does not mean you can use a state border as a magical “trespassing doesn’t apply” tool to gain access to restricted property. If a military base lies on the border of two states, you still can’t just walk into the base. The same applies with private property, you’re still subject to trespassing laws. Now a state couldn’t buy *all* the land at its border and declare it off-limits, because that would impose a realistic obstacle to inter-state travel. Your right to inter-state travel also doesn’t mean you get to violate the state you’re entering’s laws. You have to abide by the laws of the state you’re in. So you can’t bring, for example, fireworks to a state where they’re illegal even if you purchased them in a state where they are legal. You can’t make right-hand turns on red in a state where they’re illegal even if you just came from a state where they are legal. So states can deny you entry to property where would normally be denied entry. States can also punish you for violating their laws, and confiscate your contraband, once you cross their border.

"I found some further reading on some of the border/crossing closings that you mentioned: I highlighted some bits I found interesting On . Experts say the best analogy for closing the border with Mexico may be 9/11. The U.S. didn't seal the entire border after Sept. 11, 2001, instead enacting a 'Level 1 Alert.' That meant customs officers had to physically search every vehicle before allowing entrance. 'Usually you cross pretty promptly -- after 9/11 they went to this Level 1 Alert, and within about a day you had lineups of 12 to 18 hours at the borders -- both the U.S.-Canada border and the U.S.-Mexico border,' said Edward Alden, an expert on migration at the Council on Foreign Relations. The backlogs 'had an immediate effect in places like the auto industry,' he said. 'In a couple of days, GM and Ford were running out of parts they needed for production.' ---- I found in the JFK incident, shutting down the border benefited, or at least used, cooperation from the Mexican government. I think the closest of these three to a full and complete shutdown is maybe after the JFK assassination.",t3_aac5kd,NeutralPolitics

Passing ineffective laws is not unconstitutional. Congress can tax and spend. Hence, a mandate that taxes you for failing to comply with the mandate is lawful. But when the tax that is the penalty is $0, it’s lip service to congress’s authority and clearly then legislating in areas where they’re not allowed. Explain that to me. What authority is Congress exercising, aside from their authority to tax? We're not talking about any other penalties or methods of enforcement here.

Carter Page was investigated because European Intelligence provided evidence to the CIA and F.B.I that Carter was working with the Russians. Carter page has been in an out of surveillance since 2014. &#x200B; Before Donald Trump ever said he was going to run for president, Paul Manafort was being investigated by the FBI for ties with Russia. Paul Manafort worked with the pro-Russian Ukranian government and his former boss was former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Manafort has been under investigation since 2014 so to ask why now doesn't make any sense. He was being investigated before Papadopoulos. &#x200B; Flynn was getting paid by foreign governments without disclosing the information. &#x200B; Manafort just like Carter page has been in and out of investigation since 2014 again BEFORE DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED HIS PRESIDENCY. A better question is why were Manafort and Page being investigated and surveillance by the F.B.I in 2014 before Trump ever announced his presidency? Why were the investigations dropped and how does it relate to current investigations. &#x200B; I'm certain once Mueller releases his report and Trump releases his side of the story will have a better idea of what happened. &#x200B;",t3_a49220,NeutralPolitics
"The US government isn't responsible for states' debts. It gets involved in them because it's in the public interest, but if the state defaults the US government isn't liable to pay up. A colorable argument can be made however that the USA is already responsible for Puerto Rico's debt. Because, unlike the states, the USA absolutely controls Puerto Rico. And colonialism is illegal. One historical precedent is that when the USA seized Cuba from Spain it cancelled its debts to the latter because they were . In any case the USA has stopped Puerto Rico from seeking substantial debt relief by imposing the PROMESA Act, that sets up a US-appointed oversight board that is currently plotting to siphon out tax revenues from the expenditure of hurricane recovery funds. If the USA decides unilaterally when and how the debt is paid, that would suggest the debt is the USA's, not Puerto Rico's. If Puerto Rico doesn't have the power to default on its debt then it's not really its debt.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"So you're not arguing for the current system. Here's a hypothetical: would you be in favor of a system with significantly increased local control, but which eliminates the Senate entirely, making all national-level decisions in the House? This shouldn't impact your desire for increased local control at all. I wouldn't care in the slightest, because in this case increased local powers comes with significantly reduces national powers. Specifically the national government should only have legislation on national issues (equal rights for all, protection of the constitution to oversee local government overreach, national defense, foreign policy, tariffs - preferably the lack therof - internationally and between states, product safety regulation, etc.) without affecting the day to day lives of citizens. Items which directly concern the daily lives of citizens (guns, marijuana/drugs, drinking age, taxes, prostitution, crime and punishment, driving laws, etc.) should be given to the control of the local governments. A little more on the taxes issue specifically: taxes should be collected by the federal government for the purpose of funding government operations (such as the post office, interstate highway systems, military, etc.) but should not be used for any kind of wealth redistribution (welfare, healthcare, subsidies, bailouts, etc.). The issues involving wealth redistribution can be handled in line with the desires of the governed as well as with increased efficiency and accountability at the local level through either government or private initiatives. Another sidenote, specifically on the crime and punishment section. Major crimes such as murder, rape, kidnapping, slavery, etc. would all continue to be federal offenses simply because they directly relate to constitutional or natural rights (right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). All other offenses, such as petty theft, trespassing, etc. would be delegated to local governments to create law as they see fit since they are more local concerns. With a power split appropriately in that fashion the will of the majority of the country will be presented to those outside the country while the items affecting day to day life can be handled by local government. This gives increased accountability to those who wish to change everyday life for those they govern (and increased control to individuals over their own life and the issues that govern it), while maintaining a national level perspective on items that either need a higher power to rule (local governments overstepping constitutional bounds, companies shipping unsafe products to jurisdictions they cannot be touched within) or which are national level concerns (representation of the country to outside powers). It would be preferable that national bills in that type of scenario would require a larger majority to pass, but it would be less important since the power of the national government would be much more severely restricted. Perhaps for bills where the votes from representatives do not pass with a clear majority the item could be added to the ballot on a yearly election where citizens themselves could act as a tiebreaker, again allowing individuals to have more direct influence in the direction of the country. There would obviously be more nuance to it, in that the local powers described above would be split between state and smaller (county and municipality) governments, but this gets the general idea across. TLDR: I have no issues with what is described, so long as national government powers are appropriately restricted. The key here would be to create a system that enforces these restrictions to prevent national government overreach without consequences as we have today.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"However, the Senate is not an example of localized power. It necessarily performs acts which control the country at large. Same with the Presidency. I see no reason why a minority of people should have a disproportionate amount of control in deciding on national-level policies. You say you fear 'tyranny of the majority,' but when the alternative is 'tyranny of the minority,' I can't say I'm a fan. This is precisely why I believe that many of the powers held by the federal government should be passed down to state and, ideally, local governments. There are important uses for the federal government, such as national defense, international trade, and foreign relations. The government should not, however, dictate many items beyond that scope. A good example of federal overreach is the issue of marijuana: So far 20% of states plus Washington DC have legalized the recreational use of the drug, with another 23 states legalizing the medical use of it, yet it remains illegal on a federal level. Local governments have spoken on the issue and yet the federal government is paralyzed and cannot act on it due to the division in opinion on it throughout the nation. I personally believe even state powers should be limited, to curtail exactly the issue you described where tyranny of the majority can happen at the state level. Most of the power should reside with local (as in county and city) governments to determine how they wish to set their taxes, where they wish to spend those tax dollars, and how to address the issues that specifically pertain to their much smaller region of influence. You say you fear 'tyranny of the majority,' but when the alternative is 'tyranny of the minority,' I can't say I'm a fan. I understand that you don't believe that tyranny of the majority is a thing, from the way you write about it, but it's exactly how the American Revolution got its start. British citizens were a large majority over the colonists yet their concerns and interests were entirely foreign and only served to negatively affect those in the colonies. Hell, there wasn't even necessarily a majority of the colonists who were on board with the revolution, and yet they still ended up with more of a say in how they would be governed in the end allowing them to be better served by their representatives. The alternative to tyranny of the majority is not simply giving all the power to the minority. A balance needs to be found where the majority can have their interests and concerns addressed while the minority is not trampled underfoot. Right now neither the majority nor the minority holds exclusive power, and **that is a good thing**. If we had a less divisive political climate it would allow both sides to serve as the checks and balances to one another, but unfortunately due to the large divide it ends up that nothing gets done.

"I'm not changing the argument, I'm adding on to it. If the senate is supposed to represent the smaller states, that's fine. They have an equal voice compared to other states. My dislike for the system stems from that in the founding father's quest for minority rights, they neglected and failed to foresee where majority rights were supposed to flourish like the House. In addition, founding fathers didn't want a particular states with high population to determine the President and the difficulty of communication of the time, they created the Electoral College. They inadvertently created a system that brought up swing states, thus creating a system that allows states to literally determines the President. And everyone's votes don't count 1:1. I also don't believe a system should be removed purely because my opposition is benefiting from it. Then you must be fine with gerrymandering then. Just because a system is there doesn't make it right. The founding fathers and the Constitution were not infallible. It's the reason why we have amendments.

"No, the individual in the UK does not 'surrender their personal agency' to the state as you say. I think you are misunderstanding how the system here works. First of all Canada and the UK have a very different healthcare system, but more importantly-- Aside from certain Americans trying to spin it to suit their own  and the important quote by the judge: 'the strong presumption in favour of a course of action that will prolong life is not an irrebuttable one. This position reflects the fact that life, as precious as it is, cannot be, and indeed should not be preserved at all costs in the face of its natural conclusion.' So essentially the reason for terminating Alfie Evans life was because British Law doesn't believe life at all costs is something in the child's best interests, even if the parents understandably feel otherwise. The parents views may be very important, but in the eyes of British Law, for a child without capacity their interests as considered by an objective and independent court system are more important. And if that interest is to be allowed to die peacefully in a hospital rather than undergoing treatment which has no hope of working, then the child should be allowed to die peacefully against the parent's wishes. Again I reiterate the point however that it really has absolutely nothing to do with the healthcare system and I'm really confused as to why you would even think so. Even had Alfie been in a private run hospital, the doctors would have no choice but to go to the courts to ask them what they thought was in the best interest of the patient, as no hospital in the world is going to keep a comatose brain damaged infant on a ventilator with no realistic hope of recovery indefinitely. This was not like trying some experimental cancer treatment on the off chance it might be a breakthrough, there really was no chance of Alfie recovering. ",t3_a7k90f,NeutralPolitics

"Corporatism has had a very negative impact on the lives of Americans, and the Republican party is by far the bigger favorite toward pro-Corporate America policies, though the 'establishment' Democrats were not exactly saints either. Corporatism is a form of fascism, so it's not too far of a stretch to name call the Republicans as such.   The GOP has by far shifted to the right, but it strategically gets masked. Gun control reform is a great example of this, considering we had an Assault Rifle ban in place for a number of years that was allowed to sunset. Today we can't even ask for universal and expanded background checks for every gun purchase. The AR ban never even gets brought up, let alone the fact that deaths from gun violence (or maybe it was mass shootings) have skyrocketed since the sunset. I personally have never even heard of anyone mentioning this ban during 'debates' on the topic of gun control.   Minimum wage discussions have shifted to the right as well with many calling for an end to the minimum wage altogether. This was laughed at when one of the Kochs ran for president under the Libertarian party.  The Koch brothers have most definitely pushed the GOP further right through their 'grassroots' movement of pushing libertarianism on students and young professionals. The Kochs are also some of the biggest Republican donors and are actively courted by GOP politicians.  On the specific topic at hand, the divide in America, I honestly think it has always been there and we are simply seeing it come to light more vividly due to our very connected world between 24/7 news cycles and the internet (all of it, not just social media).

"I don't see this is at all bizarre. It is a textualist approach. A court does not get to amend laws to fix them. The court does not have the power to add text into a law that is not present in the law. Doing so is legislating from the bench. The court is supposed to judge the Act as passed by Congress. >1) the law exists completely abstract of the legislation that creates it Nope. There is a ton of legal history for interpreting the intent of the law based on the record of the Congress that passed it. That is *interpreting* the meaning of the law. In this specific case, the amended law is pretty clear. The individual mandate has been removed. Congress explicitly did this action and it not ambiguous. >2) judges are completely incapable of restraining unconstitutional legislation if it somehow changes an existing law? Nope. The severance doctrine I detailed above handles this. >So if they were to modify social security to only be for white people, a judge couldn't repeal the law that said social security is only for white people, he would have to repeal social security? This is entirely dependent on how the law was changed and how the statue is now written. Most likely, the offending eligibility criteria would be 'severable' from the law. This again is a completely different situation than what has happened with the ACA. In the example above, the court is **removing** text, not adding it. Your example adds limits and constraints. The changes to the ACA explicitly removed the individual mandate penalties. >Have you heard any actual legal expert espouse this position, or are you just making this up as you go? A federal judge in Texas just did this. Here is some information on interpreting statues from Idaho.  If you wish to make the claim the court can 'roll back' laws and insert provisions explicitly removed by legislative process, please cite case law supporting that position. I have been very clear that the courts are typically not able to add or change words in statutes.

"This a little adjacent to your question, but at one point : “Every line item is subject to tons of legislative, authorizing, and regulatory language with strict limitations on transfers and re-programmings,” Matthew Dennis, the Democratic spokesperson with the House Appropriations Committee, said. ... In other words, Trump can’t simply call on the Department of Defense to use its excess money for his border wall. Even the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, the Pentagon’s emergency fund which can be used for “a future event or circumstance that is possible but cannot be predicted with certainty,” often derided as a “slush fund,” isn’t a blank check. Some amounts can be shifted, but like appropriations bill, all of that funding is also regulated and authorized by Congress. This leads me to believe that money assigned for the war in Syria can't just be reassigned to whatever the Pentagon wants, and certainly not what the Executive wants. I think it's going to be decided by the House Appropriations Committee where those funds go. ---- Another option seems to be that Trump could take appropriated money and cleverly argue that it was appropriated for wall construction all along: One option reportedly under consideration is using some of the counternarcotics funding, which sits at just over $500 million, Just Security’s Kate Brannen writes: In theory, the White House could make the argument that building a border wall with Mexico is for such purposes. However, the Pentagon’s funding is explicitly for counternarcotics operating programs, not construction. While it’s not explicitly prohibited to use the funding for construction, it’s likely Congress would be furious if it was spent this way. Or use a $50 million emergency fund, that wouldn't be re-appropiated from the war in Syria: The second option is using the emergency Military Construction, MILCON, funding. Up to $50 million can be used without congressional approval in cases of national security or to protect US military officers. As Brannen writes, “using MILCON funding is also guaranteed to make members of Congress particularly angry, because it would be the military construction projects in their districts that would be directly losing money to the wall.” Or perhaps if equipment in Syria is what the funds were allocated for, he could do something like this: As William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor pointed out in the New York Times last year, there are two other laws give Trump some wiggle room to move money around: the Economy Act of 1932, which could authorizes federal agencies to exchange supplies or services, and the Feed and Forage Act, a 1799 law which allowed the military to buy essential supplies like clothing or medicine. But according to the New York Times, “such an accounting trick has never been used to go around Congress on such a large scale, Mr. Banks said.” ",t3_aadfxc,NeutralPolitics

"Moving the business to and from a locality can also have positive effects for the surrounding area though, which is important to note. The other advantage of having local control is that a direct, rather than representative, democracy system is more feasible in that large changes (such as those to labor laws to bring a corporation into the state) can be voted on directly by those who would be affected by it rather than negotiated by representatives who are abstracted from the entire situation. Labor laws would be a great example of something that should be handled by the county or municipality. These are the people who would be working there, providing a check and balance to the corporation that might otherwise try to take advantage of the leverage they'd otherwise have. There would also be nothing stopping citizens from agreeing to the labor conditions to guarantee the move before later realizing they were terrible and changing them to be more favorable for workers later. It's not profitable for companies to be constantly moving their operations since the facilities of these large companies cost hundreds of millions of dollars to set up, meaning companies can't go around threatening to leave every time they don't get things exactly the way they want them. With regards to the social safety net, people are far more likely to give to a program like that when they can see the benefits for themselves. While the ultra-rich may not notice additional taxes for social safety nets, it's a large point of contention among the middle class. 'Why should I give my hard earned money to those people across the country?' is no longer a factor when you are face to face with the people you're helping (or deciding to not help) every day. States or localities that want to seek alternative solutions, such as increased job opportunities for residents by providing incentives for companies to operate there, can do so. Other states that would prefer to have a bit more secure of a system at a higher cost to everyone can choose to do that as well. Citizens who don't like one system or the other are able to more easily move between the two systems because the place with lower taxes and business expenses will have lower unemployment (easier to get a job in new area) and the place with the stronger safety net but higher taxes and costs will have the system in place to help you while you get back onto your feet after the move and find a job with the more sparse employment opportunities.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"It wasn’t a major issue because if you go back and look at public criticism of Obama from MSM outlets, it simply wasn’t there. He expelled more undocumented immigrants than any president, killed a US citizen with a drone without due process, and had an AG (Eric Holder) that ran a “sting” operation that allowed machine guns to be sold to Mexican drug cartels resulting in the death of multiple border patrol agents and yielded nothing in return. These are just simple examples but Obama never faced scathing media coverage. It was at most “Oh Obama, you silly head...” Of course there was Fox News, but you have to realize something about Fox News, they exist for the illusion of a counter to liberal politics. Watch them, they made Steven Colbert physically ill because they out jackassed him when he had the Colbert show on Comedy Central. Rather than provide actual detail to their stories, it always remained sound bite garbage. Anyhow, it’s a hot button issue now because there is a President in office who really doesn’t bow to either party. So any shaming, scathing articles, whatever story, that can be written to paint him as the most extreme, most egregious piece of crap ever, is printed and run with, without validation or context. - Look at the kid in cages story. Pictures plastered everywhere about illegal immigrants children separated and in cages. Then the press quietly backed off when it was revealed that the pictures were from the Obama administration, and the separation of children is done in order to fight human trafficking (Obama admin identified that a massive amount of parents crossing the border were human traffickers with kids who weren’t theirs). But none of that made it to the fore front, and it’s hard to unring a bell. So, DAMN ORANGE MAN!!",t3_a1asan,NeutralPolitics

">Those living in DC who desire representation are free to move to any of the 50 states where they do have representation. No one is forcing them to live without representation, they choose to live in DC. They are also free to advocate for statehood. I don't understand why your solution of forcing someone to move from their home in any way invalidates the arguments for statehood. I have lived in Maryland and DC. They are significantly different places with different cultures. The political arguments for statehood are just as valid as the political arguments against statehood. If you ignore all the party politics of the situation, you are left with people in America wanting to live in a state with representation, but not being allowed to. That issue is enough to convince me no matter the party results. Now I may be in the minority of that opinion, but the issue has also never been fully debated on a national stage and the people it affects the most, citizens of DC,  The idea that 'you are free to move' is generally a weak argument. We try to make places better, not run away from them. The fact that a person is not a prisoner does not force them to surrender to any circumstance.

There is a famous speech by him that basically went, 'if you think immigrants, single mothers, and drugs are okay in society, then we aren't for you.' He started the 90s and helped reclaim the house and then ran the largest change in how the house operates, making it far more partisan. There is even a great speech by the outgoing speaker of the house telling him, 'The GOP can't run the country on hate'. There is even a public record of the house rebuking Newt for what he was doing and the trouble he was causing.

"A new project - like building a wall - would require new funding. Maybe or maybe not. Some government accounting codes are extremely flexible. It’s not outside the realm of possibility that some funding could be teased out of DHS under the umbrella of “border security”. >In addition, you're pulling personnel away from training or maintenance of equipment. Do you think the military just sits around doing nothing? Each branch of the military has Engineer units who’s primary job is... construction/sustainment of infrastructure. The Navy and Air Force could deploy their SeeBee and Red Horse/Prime BEEF units as primary Civil Engineers with Army and Marine Combat Engineers assistance. Source: I was an Air Force Civil Engineer for 20 years. >Equipment must be maintained, training exercises like Red Flag are conducted, and so on. True, but every year Engineer units participate in field training exercises, like Silver Flag, which focus on construction/Civil Engineering. In my mind, turning wall construction into a massive joint field training exercise would enhance military effectiveness and interoperability. Particularly given the joint nature of many deployments where you can have, as an example, an Army unit exercising operational control of an Air Force Engineer flight. And that’s not addressing the positive effect that this project would have on skills-based competencies and exercising/refining tactics, techniques, and procedures. Funds, equipment, and material could be diverted from normal field training exercises to fund the deployment and maintenance of troops. The PCA wouldn’t be an issue as long as these units were deployed in a training capacity and they didn’t take on a law enforcement role. Yes, even the military has to go through environmental studies before anything can be built. Absolutely the truth. Edit: And that's just a one time thing - it will cost billions more annually to man and monitor said wall for every year to come. This may be pessimistic. Don’t discount cost savings through defense in depth and remote sensors. For example, military seismomicrophone were used in trench warfare during World War I, and can be monitored remotely by existing units. Remote IR cameras can also be employed and monitored remotely. I think it would be interesting to see what the military could come up with, especially under the direction of innovative Commanders. ",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

"Being in this sub, I'd really like some sources if you're going to make claims like that. I do appreciate you expanding on your vibe though. Since you've given me nothing to go on, I'll share some pretty balanced commentary from PK. I think you probably mean 'Trump focused' other than 'overwhelmingly partisan' because PK seems to mostly cover the ongoing scandals. Unless you can share items that show that PK is 'overwhelmingly and consistently partisan' and 'selectively leaves out any information that could challenge the narrative' I'm going to have to continue trusting PK's commentary as I do any other wellsourced commentary. I was unable to find any Turkish media sources which is interesting as this is a Turkish issue.

I use those sources sparsley, usually because the information in the article best articulates a number of claims that are then sourced from more well-established publications. I include certain articles in an attempt to cut down the number of characters I use rather than sourcing each claim separately, unfortunately Reddit has a character limit. I understand your concerns and I'll try to do better :) I believe PK is hindered, as we all are, by their own biases and experiences. I am open to the idea that some things are missing that could better challenge the posts. But I completely reject the idea that PK is more interested in spinning a certain narrative than the truth, as you said before. If you are able to challenge the posts, or give more insight into your claims, I think that would be very worth while considering how many people trust PK.

"1) Section 4 provides this information: >Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. So basically the VP + a majority of the cabinet members or a group designated by congress get do decide when the President is incapacitated enough to start the process. The formal process is played out in the wiki article I linked: >It allows the vice president, together with a 'majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide', to declare the president 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office' in a written declaration to Congress. The transfer of authority to the vice president is immediate and (as with Section 3) the vice president becomes acting president – not president – and the president remains in office, though without authority. >A president declared unable to serve may issue a counter-declaration stating that he is indeed able. This marks the beginning of a four-day period during which the vice president remains acting president. If by the end of this period the vice president and a majority of the 'principal officers of the executive departments' have not issued a second declaration of the president's incapacity, then the president resumes his powers and duties. >If a second declaration of incapacity is issued within the four-day period, then the vice president remains acting president while Congress considers the matter. If within 21 days the Senate and the House determine, each by a two-thirds vote, that the president is incapacitated, then the vice president continues as acting president. If either the Senate or the House holds a vote on the question which falls short of the two-thirds requirement, or the 21 days pass without both votes having taken place, then the president resumes his powers and duties. If Kennedy was able to speak, but incoherently, that would probably fall under an incapacitated president that cannot voluntarily give up his power. Section 3 requires the voluntary transfer of power to be given up in writing. I'm assuming he wouldnt be able to write coherently either. Speaking isnt a requirement. Now assuming that Kennedy needs to be removed under Section 4, the process I quoted above says that Johnson would become Acting President immediately when it is declared by himself and a majority of the Cabinet members. Johnson would be Acting President with full presidential powers until Congress votes to elevate him to the Presidency. The hypethetical timeline would be: - Kennedy shot. - Johnson immediately becomes Acting President. Kennedy cannot carry out the duties while being operated on, similar situation happened with Reagan when he was shot. Not exactly sure but I believe this is a VP decision. - Johnson and the Cabinet meet (Probably at least after Kennedy is stabalized. Any sooner would look bad. This meeting probably wouldnt happen for a few days until Johnson could meet with Kennedy first.) to see if Kennedy can continue his presidency. They vote by majority that Kennedy cannot. Section 4 kicks in. - Process of removal begins. Johnson is Acting President. Begin 4 day period where Kennedy can protest. -After that period has passed, 21 day period where Congress votes on whether or not to remove Kennedy begins. - If either the House or Senate fails to reach a 2/3 vote to remove Kennedy in that 21 day period, Kennedy remains President, Johnson continues being Acting President until Kennedy can return to office. If they do reach the vote in time, Johnson becomes President and Kennedy is removed. ----------------------------------------------- 2) OP mentioned it in the comment you replied to: >U.S. immigration officials said that the Departure Control Law, authorizing the prevention of any alien or U.S. citizen from leaving the country, became effective shortly after 8 p.m. Friday. >An order dispatched to Mexican border officials by Lic.

"The problem is that it is legal to pass a law to remove a tax. Lots of things are legal if you remove the context which makes it illegal. I have a right to drive a car and own a gun. That right cannot be removed arbitrarily. However, that right can be taken away if I lose my driver's license or commit certain felonies. When the cop arrests me for illegal firearm possession, I can't just say 'The problem officer, is that it is legal to own a gun.' It's legal to own a gun, but it's not legal for that specific person to own a gun. It's legal for me to fire my employee for any reason or no reason, but I can't fire him for being black (certainly the government can't fire their own employee for being black). When positive and negative rights collide, there is a logical way to resolve which 'wins'. Congress has a positive right to tax. You have a negative right to free speech ('Congress shall pass no law... abridging the freedom of speech'). Congress's positive right to tax doesn't override your negative right to speech. They can't levy a tax against people critical of the government, because that speech is protected. Congress has the power to pass laws with respect to taxation, but there are limits on it. For one thing ' all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States'. You can't tax certain types of speech. I think SCOTUS would overturn a law that raised taxes on guns so much that private ownership was impossible. As I showed with my other example, lowering taxes has to follow the same rules as raising them. You can't pass one law that uniformly taxes everyone, then repeal the tax only for specific groups in a way that violates the 14th amendment. I guess I just can't get around this fundamentally bizzare mindset. Law A is legal. Law B amends Law A in an illegal way. Law B is fine, Law A needs to be overturned. I mean, if Congress passed a law saying the US Olympic Team doesn't need to pay any taxes the year of the Olympics, and that law was found to be Unconstitutional, would you expect the court to abolish *all taxes* because they they all became Unconstitutional, or abolish just the one law that caused the problem? &#x200B;",t3_a6c04o,NeutralPolitics

"Okay so there are a wide variety of reasons for being friendly to immigration. Personally, I lean libertarian in economic matters, which means I believe that most markets should be deregulated as much as possible. I also don't think free markets can exist without free movement of labor. I believe in competition, which means I think people, both inside and outside the US, should compete with each other for jobs. This is a good thing, it means the hard workers will rise to the top and the shit workers will not. I don't particularly care if those hard workers are American or not, I don't think you're entitled to an easier life because you were born in the right country or have the right parents. And if the jobs are shitty or terrible, these workers should have the right to move elsewhere where they are not. In this way, free movement of labor will cause the places with good jobs and good labor laws to rise, while the places with terrible working conditions and shit worker pay and protections to fail. I think this is also a good thing. If your state or country has shitty labor laws or terrible conditions, I think we should allow workers to leave until it either passes reforms or fails entirely. Free market at work. I also want to point out that free movement of labor is one of the best ways to address labor shortages, which are chronic in several economic sectors in the US.

How much of the military budget would actually being used here is hard to say. In general, flying in hundreds of troops and tons of equipment is something the military does pretty efficiently, so it's probably no less wasteful than the many other political projects the military gets up to. We have surplus equipment and manpower, somewhere I don't doubt. Truth be told, I don't know economics or the facts of our military involvement at the wall well enough to guess how much this would cost or what would be considered too much, but in general I'm pretty sure America won't start speaking Russian just because a token force of army engineers are raising walls at our border.",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

At best, a lawn dart could be considered an improvised weapon if used as such. Article 1 section 8 of the Constitution contains no provision empowering congress to create the CPSC. Even if it did, it would not have the power to ban lawn darts as again, such authority is not granted to congress. You cannot create an organization and grant it authority that you do not already possess. To further belabor the point, the ninth amendment and tenth amendment state that, essentially, other rights exist that are not listed in the bill of rights and any powers not expressly provided to congress are reserved for the states and the people. I posit that possession and use of lawn darts fall under those 'other rights', and further posit that, if anything, regulations on their use should fall to state-level regulation. A law's continued existence does not imply constitutionality. It merely means that nobody with an interest in having that law reversed has cared enough (or had enough political horsepower) to get it removed.

You seem to be implying that I'm trying to hide my personal bias behind the way I phrase statements, much in the same way that you intentionally phrased your statements to make my argument sound weaker rather than actually arguing the point I made. For reference, here is what I said in my original post: I, personally, would prefer a system closer to that especially with how divisive the country has become in the gap between urban centers and the rest of the country. Localized power, as opposed to centralized power, benefits both those in cities and those in rural areas. People in cities get what they want without those in rural areas having their concerns placed above theirs. People in rural areas get what they want without those in urban areas having their concerns placed above theirs. Everybody keeps their nose out of each others' business and everyone ends up happier as a result.

While Mattis is a retiree commissioned officer subject to the UCMJ, such as (which does not include retirees and certain Reserve status), these are *specific* regulations and should not be construed such that openly criticizing civilian leadership in government is prohibited activity for the military.

The USA gave Greece a shitty puppet right wing dictator. Germany payed no war reparations to Greece, which was one of the most devestated countries, and fought arguably the longest and hardest for their small size. Defeated the italians, and held off Hitler into the Russian winter, stalling the advance into Russia significantly. So Greece was truly left battered.

The USA propped up their side in the west, to win this ideological war. And nobody gave a shit about Greece.

Making things worse of course, is the legacy of the cold war on our political discourse which made basically any genuinely leftist ideas (not that there are particularly many of them) pretty well taboo in the minds of most, and when they did slip in usually they were taken up by democrats and branded as 'liberal', which simply further confused everyone involved.

Sebelius, the SCOTUS interpreted this emphasis as the critical piece which actually upheld the entire law - the ACA is so dependent on the mandate that they can’t really be separated, so because the mandate was ruled constitutional in that case the rest of the law was OK as well. Logically, this makes sense as we’ve all seen what has happened to premiums as less and less healthy people use the program. I’ve got another answer in this thread as to why the elimination of the tax creates constitutionality issues for the mandate. Based on the same logic as the SCOTUS, since this judge has found the mandate unconstitutional now the rest of the ACA can’t work either.

The suggested number of total seats is ~900, and while the math involved doesn't bring us down to 60k population represented per elected official, it does bring us much nearer that number (about 200k to 300k population per House Rep.) As we're currently 10-20x above that 60k figure (~11x higher on average) this would be a marked improvement, which may be manageable in terms of infrastructure.

"According to Howard Hackley, General Counsel of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, writing in 1972: Under the Federal Reserve Act, a Board member may be removed by the President only 'for cause', which is understood to mean **incompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.**  More interestingly, the requirement for cause also means he has a Constitutional right to due process, which typically means prior notice of the reason for termination, a pre-termination hearing in which he can offer a defense, and an opportunity to appeal the termination. This has been affirmed by the Supreme Court many times, notably (iirc) in . The question then becomes who is the adjudicator for such an appeal. Civil servants in the Senior Executive Service typically have the right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. However, the Federal Reserve Act specifically exempts the Federal Reserve from the classified civil service, meaning that avenue appears closed to Powell.

You can also see how historical and current political figures are positioned on this graph (according to the creators' metrics and assumptions, that is). I say it's only somewhat similar in that the creators have already determined the dimensions for the final plot. That is, there *could* be a set of choices that actually lead to better clustering. There's also not a whole lot of transparency of how the scoring and weighting system works, which the creators claim is because it would lessen the accuracy — i.e., people would be tempted to answer questions in a way that fit their self-image rather than answering the questions as they are.

"I partially agree. You’re certainly right about geographic representation as a mechanism, but there’s other factors involved as well, and the benefits of federalism far outweigh a single unitary state. I certainly think Congressional districting within states exasperates the phenomena and is unnecessary (not to mention constitutionally unfounded in the first place). I think another part of the problem is that the ratio of federal taxing/spending to state taxing/spending has increased over time, and so pork barreling in general has evolved as a means towards returning revenues to local issues. I feel like this could be better handled by some sort of joint state-federal tax revenue sharing system, whereby Congress and the state legislatures can negotiate the distribution between state and federal budgets (something like 40/60, respectively, seems about right). This would also help maintain clarity on federal vs state jurisdictions.",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

Funding has to go through the treasury and then get allocated by congress, there no presidential slush fund. Theoretically the best a President could do would be to privately fund something and then gift it it the government. But even this has issues. The best example are the various conservationists who have attempted to donate land on the requirement that it become a state/national park/forest/protected area. Some examples are  along with a few other examples. So Trump could buy all the land, pay to build his stupid wall, and then donate it to the government, but since Trump doesn’t have 5-70 billion dollars, or the ability to declare Eminent Domain, it’s highly unlikely that he could.

"It really depends. I work for the corps of engineers (still relatively new and low level) and in my understanding of our funding infrastructure, congress has to grant two things: authorization and appropriation. Authorization is the permission to actually do a project, and appropriations are the monetary resources we need to do the project. We already have authorization that was passed bipartisanly in the 2000s, so we are allowed to build a wall. However, we don’t have money to build it yet. For the vast majority of our work, we have to have congress grant money that is specifically allocated to a particular project. There are so some instances, however, where they will grant us money with fewer strings attached and we have a much wider platitude as an organization how we want to spend it. I am not aware that we have any such funding currently, and I suspect that congress has made sure that no such money would be available. Ultimately, all of our money comes from congress, and the vast majority of the time, that money is given a specific designation as to how it can be used, and any other use would be illegal. So if Trump wants to use the military to build the wall, he would need to obtain funding for it. I will say that while $5 billion is an astronomical number for individuals, a cost like that is fairly typical for large scale public infrastructure projects like that. The wall is mostly a political football where the wall’s success or failure to be built will determine the Trump presidency’s success or failure. Trump’s presidency is inextricably tied to the wall, as it was his primary campaign promise. If the democrats can stop him, they can claim a political success. That’s ultimately what this issue boils down to. ",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

">Studies that look at consumption (which people tend to smooth over time while income fluctuates) also show a middle class much better off today then several decades ago. I don't think I agree with this characterization of the Sacerdote article. To begin with, for what it's worth, I would be a little hesitant to treat those adjustment measures of consumption as ipso facto reliable just yet. PCE is a reasonably common metric with a track record, but the adjustments used by the author and by Hamilton undershoot the both the traditional CPI and PCE substantially. It could be that they represent genuine improvements in accuracy over the existing measures or it could be that they're introducing new biases. The incrementalist in me is skeptical to embrace these supposedly more accurate metrics until such time as smarter minds than mine have had a chance to crack them open and play with them. Not saying they're inaccurate, just saying that even given the large chorus of voices saying CPI is a flawed measure, Sacerdote shows some wildly different estimations of purchasing power. Not saying they're wrong, just saying I'm approaching with trepidation. However, that isn't really my main objection to Sacerdote, which are twofold. (1) Handwaving inequality by looking at absolute increases in consumption is extremely problematic (though Sacerdote is far from the only economist who engages in this line of thinking). Income inequality causes substantial social problems,  I would, therfore, suggest it's dubious that middle class households are 'much better off today then several decades ago' even before we get into the much thornier issue of what it means to be better off.

The best way to answer is that “we’re not entirely sure how much power the President has except with the couple Supreme Court cases (Youngstown Sheet Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) United States v. Nixon 418 U.S. 683 (1974) ) Throughout our Country’s history, the Supreme Court has been trying to hold off in deciding cases about the President, because they’re not supposed to rule on Political Question, and they understand the lasting effects with the balance of power in the three branches of government.",t3_a8mtoc,NeutralPolitics

If the subsidies went away, people in cities would still be able to buy these products (for about the same amount of money), but they would come from other countries. Meanwhile, you're not paying an expensive, college-educated American worker to pick cotton. And then, maybe, that unemployed farm worker decides to move to a city (because there's no more work in rural areas) and get an engineering degree so that they can design farm equipment to sell to other countries (an industry where US workers *are* competitive). Now, that worker isn't just not costing city dwellers a bunch of money, they're actually generating a lot more value for everyone.

You’ll both get dirty, but the pig will think it’s quite nice. This plays into their hands, whereas for us getting dirty is just a pain. Instead, we have to try to stay clean and focus on the part of our society that has to work: democracy and freedom of expression, to make sure that giving the citizens correct information becomes our best form of resistance.’’ >The Nordic states continue to raise their populations’ awareness of and resiliency to Kremlin disinformation campaigns. In advance of a military exercise in Sweden, which also included the other Nordic states, the Baltics, and the United States, the defense ministries of Sweden and Denmark released a joint statement announcing their intention to team up to deter Russian government cyberattacks and disinformation operations. And Sweden, which will hold elections in 2018, has begun ramping up its defenses against disinformation operations through its Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB). The agency has picked up on fake news stories that push narratives claiming that Sweden is a war zone and the rape capital of Europe, and that it has banned Christmas lights and the eating of bacon on trains. Echoing the U.S. experts hired by Finland, the head of MSB’s global analysis and monitoring section, Mikael Tofvesson, has emphasized that the MSB’s strategy is not to fight fire with fire, noting that: >While consolidating his grip on power at home, Mr. Putin oversaw an opportunistic expansion of malign influence operations abroad, targeting vulnerable states on Russia’s periphery, as well as countries in Western institutions like the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Kremlin has substantially increased its investments in propaganda outlets beyond Russia’s borders, funded and supported nongovernmental organizations and political parties that advanced Mr. Putin’s antiEU and anti-NATO agenda, nationalized mafia groups to help launder money and commit other crimes for the state abroad, and used its near-monopoly over energy supplies in some countries to exert influence and spread corruption. >In semi-consolidated democracies and transitional governments on Russia’s periphery, the Kremlin most aggressively targets states that seek to integrate with the EU and NATO or present an opportunity to weaken those institutions from within. For example, as Georgia and Ukraine moved closer to these institutions, the Russian government attacked them with cyberwarfare, disinformation campaigns, and military force. When the Kremlin’s attempt to politically influence Montenegro’s election failed, its security services allegedly tried to launch a coup. In Serbia, the Kremlin exploits cultural connections and leverages its near monopoly on energy supplies to attempt to slow down or derail the country’s Western integration efforts. And though they are in the EU and NATO, countries like Hungary and Bulgaria face acute challenges from the Russian government, which exerts significant influence in politics, business, and the energy sector. Despite some efforts to counter Russian malign influence, these countries remain significantly vulnerable to the Kremlin’s corrupt agenda. >In consolidated democracies within the EU and NATO, the **Russian government seeks to undermine support for sanctions against Russia, interfere in elections through overt or covert support of sympathetic political parties and the spread of disinformation, and sow discord and confusion by exacerbating existing social and political divisions through disinformation and cultivated ideological groups**. >This group of countries has developed several effective countermeasures that both deter Russian government behavior and build societal resilience. **As it crafts its response, the United States should look to these lessons learned**: >- The United Kingdom has made a point to publicly chastise the Russian government for its meddling in democracies, and moved to strengthen cybersecurity and electoral processes. >- Germany pre-empted Kremlin interference in its national election with a strong warning of consequences, an agreement among political parties not to use bots or paid trolls, and close cyber cooperation between the government and political campaigns. >- Spain has led Europe in cracking down on Russia-based organized crime groups that use the country as an operational base and node for money laundering and other crimes. >- France has fostered strong cooperation between government, political, and media actors to blunt the impact of the Kremlin’s cyber-hacking and smear campaigns. >- The Nordic states have largely adopted a ‘‘whole of society’’ approach against Mr. Putin’s malign influence operations, involving the government, civil society, the media, and the private sector, with an emphasis on teaching critical thinking and media literacy. >- The Baltic states have kept their publics well-informed of the malicious activities of Russia’s security services, strengthened defenses against cyberattacks and disinformation, and diversified energy supplies to reduce dependence on Russia.

"It will not be constitutional without a deliberate misreading of the 1934's language, its legislative intent, and an ignorance about firearms are and how they function. I will add onto this with further sources or video demonstrations or greater clarification if desired: The NFA defines a machine gun as a 'weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.' This is why there will be no future for this change. The 1982 BATFE ruling that open-bolt semi-auto guns are legally machine guns was OK because the 1934 NFA specified that something which can be 'readily' made into a machinegun is a machine gun. (  , then, yep - it's a machinegun. Why? Because even though it's fabric, it's doing what you'd otherwise accomplish with something made in metal (or removed in metal) to *automatically fire the gun multiple times with a single action of the trigger* Notice the difference between the shoe string and the bumpstock in terms of the 1934 Statute **as written** If a bumpstock is a 'machinegun' then **any** autoloading/selfloading firearm is 'a machinegun' or at least readily convertible to a machinegun. You can, after all, bumpfire, without a bumpstock - because that's how laws of motion work. Semi-automatic firearms have been widely sold in the US and Europe since the 1890s, with 'repeating' firearms enjoying a very short heyday after the invention of the metallic cartridge, in comparison. The notion that the NFA 1934 specifies 'machinegun' to mean not just guns which fire automatically because of a single mechanical function of the weapon, but *actually* all self-loading firearms because 'automatic' fire is 'fast' and semi-auto fire is 'slow' is just indefensible. At that point, a person fanning a Colt Single Action Army revolver has a machinegun, and someone with an electronic trigger attached to a gattling style crank on a .50 BMG - but who has set the speed to a 'low' level (is anything about cycle rate in the 1934 NFA for us to clarify that?) does not have a machinegun.

You asked: If inflation is in line with expectation, why are they continuing to hike rates and tighten the balance sheet? I quoted why the FED decided to keep raising rates and unwind their balance sheet. The question is whether or not raising rates 8 times and unwinding half a trillion in balance sheet in less than two years when inflation is only 2% and wage growth is modest is appropriate. They raised rates 8 times and are unwinding the balance sheet to reach normalization and achieve the Fed . You are arguing points I never made and citing quotes from the Fed that I have already argued are inconsistent. I responded exactly to the point you made above and explained why the Fed continues to act. The answers are all clearly presented to you. I engaged based on what was presented to me.

"Some interesting bits: Our court [MA Supreme Court] concluded that since stun guns did not exist at the time the Second Amendment right to bear arms was created, the Second Amendment does not apply to stun guns: *The ban on the private possession of stun guns will not burden conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment if a stun gun is a weapon not “in common use at the time” of enactment of the Second Amendment and would be dangerous per se at common law without another, primary use, i.e., as a tool. . . . [T]here can be no doubt that a stun gun was not in common use at the time of enactment, and it is not the type of weapon that is eligible for Second Amendment protection.* However, on further appeal, in a very interesting example of the idea that old constitutional principles apply to new technologies, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned that decision. The U.S. court criticized our court’s decision saying: *. . . the [Massachusetts] court explained that stun guns are not protected because they “were not in common use at the time of the Second Amendment’s enactment.” . . . This is inconsistent with Heller’s [a previous U.S. case] clear statement that the Second Amendment “extends . . . to . . . arms . . . that were not in existence at the time of the founding.”* So then it sounds like they wanted to regulate stun guns as firearms, but that proved difficult because of existing laws. For example, some statutes exist to prevent a firearm from exploding, which these tasers wouldn't, or not in the same way: *Has a frame, . . . that is composed of: (i) any metal having a melting point of less than 900 degrees Fahrenheit; (ii) any metal having an ultimate tensile strength of less than 55,000 pounds per square inch; or (iii) any powdered metal having a density of less than 7.5 grams per cubic centimeter.* ",t3_a7sg2q,NeutralPolitics

"Is that a good thing for our Democracy or not? I don't think so. I don't know what the answer is, but I do think its a problem and will lead to most people thinking that its unfair. This was exactly the point I was trying to make. The divide keeps growing, and to me the most obvious solution is to have more localized government as opposed to a centralized source of federal power. Here's what I had to say about the matter in a reply to a different comment: Localized power, as opposed to centralized power, benefits both those in cities and those in rural areas. People in cities get what they want without those in rural areas having their concerns placed above theirs. People in rural areas get what they want without those in urban areas having their concerns placed above theirs. Everybody keeps their nose out of each others' business and everyone ends up happier as a result. Centralized power ONLY benefits those with a numerical majority, even if they represent only a small geographic subset of the country and their concerns aren't aligned with hundreds of millions of others who live differently than they do. To add onto that, centralized power also breeds the resentment and division we currently see in our political landscape. Both sides feel like it's unfair and start fighting dirty to make things (in their opinion) 'more fair' for them. Both sides have valid points that address the concerns of their specific constituents, but they refuse to admit that what they want will never work for the other side and their constituents on a national or even statewide scale because that would be the same as admitting defeat in today's political climate. Thus the cycle continues, and will always continue, until one of several things happens: 1) The country becomes more culturally homogenized where the opinions of different voters are more likely to agree (as is the case in more rural European states such as Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden) 2) The country becomes more urbanized on a national scale to the point that even the votes of those in the geographic majority are drowned out entirely 3) Power shifts to become more localized rather than centralized, allowing for all citizens to have more direct representation that addresses their specific needs and concerns without having a large (or small) population thousands of miles away impose law upon them that the local population believes to be negative I personally believe outcomes 1 and 2 would be poor outcomes, because cultural diversity is one of the cornerstones of the United States and the continued urbanization of the country would systematically destroy the culture large portions of the country developed as the frontier expanded. Localized power would do neither of these things, and would make it easier for everyone to have their voices heard without being drowned out by another group with different interests and concerns.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"Using the catchall term 'NRA' isn't probably precise enough and in this case is not really the issue. The NRA is a collection of entities, including the  meaning the only way anyone would know where the money actually comes from would be via self-reporting or if there were some legal investigation that got to look at the books. As per the last link: In 2016, the NRA-ILA made $33.3 million in independent expenditures — including $12.3 million against Clinton and $8.8 million for Trump, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA-PVF and NRA-ILA spent a combined $54.4 million on independent expenditures and other political communications in the 2016 election cycle — three times more than they did during the previous presidential campaign in 2012. So we can neither say the NRA did or did not help funnel money from Russia to the Trump campaign IMO. It is probably fair to say that anyone who wanted to funnel money to the NRA certainly would use their PAC's which are shrouded rather than the main organization which is required to be transparent. We can also say that coincidentally as Russians set up backchannel communications through the NRA to the Republican party (per the Butina conviction) and at the same time that the Russians ran a mass disinformation and propaganda campaign in support of a specific candidate and a couple high-profile issues (per Mueller investigation and all our and our allies' intelligence agencies), the NRA's PACs had a huge influx of money and spending (cited above). So because a system has been created that enables anyone to funnel money anywhere as long as people choose not to self-report violations of FEC rules since there is no enforcement, there probably wouldn't be anyway to know outside of some theoretical whistle blower.

"You can't talk about the 'compromise' on gun laws without also talking about the corresponding violence that occurs. Just calling it a compromise and displaying it as a cake shows the true divide in America if that's all that you truly see. Talking about compromises is complete BS in this regard. They left it open that background checks aren't required for every transaction, thus making certain methods easier to obtain a gun. That's quite literally the definition of a loophole (emphasis mine): 'A loophole is an ambiguity or inadequacy in a system, such as a law or security, **which can be used to circumvent or otherwise avoid the purpose, implied or explicitly stated, of the system.**'  The reason we hear about mass shootings all the time isn't because they changed the definition, it's because they are happening more frequently. An FBI study determined that active shooter incidents rose during a study they conducted between 2000-2013. That is based on FBI data, not on 'biased media reporting.'  There is a stark contrast in America based that mimics my original comment and yours above truly exemplifies this stark divide. You are acting like most people want gun control for no reason and that's nowhere near reality. If you really want to know reality it is more akin to having conversations with friends about the fears of raising future children in such a world where shootings are considered 'normal'. I live in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and I've never felt unsafe in my life in this area (outside of obvious ghettos), but the fact that a mass shooting can occur in a nice affluent neighborhood is terrifying. It's even more terrifying that some people want to keep enabling these monsters. It's absolutely insane that our solution to such a horrible problem is 'DO NOTHING! ACTUALLY, GO BACK IN TIME AND WE SHOULD ALL HAVE GUNS!' Outside of rural America nobody thinks that is a viable idea nor is that pushed for. ",t3_a3i7ai,NeutralPolitics

"I would add to this by saying that while the debate about reasonable vs. unreasonable use of tear gas is certainly worth having, this debate isn't directly relevant to the question of when tear gas use is compliant with international chemical weapons conventions. The 1993 protocol that permits tear gas for use in riot control doesn't really take a position on how reasonable or justified the decision to use tear gas is. The protocol just singles out use in warfare and prohibits it. Article I, Section 5 states the general principle: >Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare. Article II, Section 7 elaborates on where this rule applies: >'Riot Control Agent' means: Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure. And Article II, Section 9(d) explicitly states that the convention isn't meant to apply to traditional law enforcement: >'Purposes Not Prohibited Under this Convention' means: ... Law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes. So by the terms of this convention, the use of tear gas, even use that is arguably unreasonable, is permitted so long as it isn't used in a war. ",t3_a1asan,NeutralPolitics

"Late to this party, hope this doesn't get buried. Disclaimer: As some people know, I'm in an officer in the military, but none of this is official word, just my own personal private citizen analysis of the situation. This is a classic example of Trump and a lot of other people not understanding how the military works - or really, government in general. First, let's address a common aspect. **Posse Comitatus Act Does Not Apply to Construction Projects** This gets brought up a lot, but the . These measures generally provide funding authority in response to the President’s budget request for a fiscal year (October 1 - September 30). * The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations exercise jurisdiction over the annual appropriations measures. Each committee has 12 subcommittees, with each subcommittee having responsibility for developing one regular annual appropriations bill to provide funding for departments and activities within its jurisdiction. There are three subcommittees that deal with national defense: Subcommittee on Defense, Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies, and the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development (the Army Corps of Engineers falls under this, for instance). The next step is the Committee Process: >Upon receipt of the President’s budget request, the appropriations subcommittees begin a series of hearings in which the senior civilian and military leadership of the Department of Defense, the military services, and certain defense agencies are invited to testify before the subcommittees on the budget request. And >After conducting these hearings, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees make their suballocations, and the subcommittees begin to draft, mark up, and report the appropriations bills to their respective full committees. The full committees also hold a markup, and may adopt amendments to a subcommittee’s recommendations before reporting the bills and making them available for floor consideration. In addition to drafting the bills, the subcommittees also prepare reports, which include information required by House and Senate rules, explain committee actions and provide guidance, and directives to agencies. Committee reports may not be amended directly during floor proceedings. The House then typically initiates appropriations measures. It is debated, amended, and voted on and passed to the Senate where: >The Senate Appropriations Committee typically begins reporting the bills in June. The recent practice generally has been for the Senate to consider the text of a bill as reported by its Appropriations Committee in the form of a complete substitute amendment for the House-passed bill. The House and Senate versions are then reconciled as they must be voted on again in identical form. What happens if Congress can't agree on a budget, as they haven't for the military for many years prior? Well, you get a Continuing Resolution: >If this process is not completed prior to the start of the fiscal year (October 1), Congress may need to enact one or more measures to provide temporary funding authority pending the final disposition of the regular appropriations bills, either separately or as part of an omnibus measure. Because budget authority is typically provided for a single fiscal year, temporary funding measures are necessary if action on a regular appropriations measure has not been completed prior to the beginning of a fiscal year in order to prevent a funding gap that could require an agency to cease nonexcepted activities. Traditionally, temporary funding has been provided in the form of a joint resolution to allow agencies or programs to continue to obligate funds at a particular rate (such as the rate of operations for the previous fiscal year), for a specific period of time, which may range from a single day to an entire fiscal year. These measures are known as continuing resolutions (or CRs). Obviously, if World War 3 broke out tomorrow, the military wouldn't be stuck with 'well, you didn't appropriate for World War 3, so we're not fighting.' So what happens if the President or someone else wants to add something? >In addition to the amounts provided in a regular appropriations measure, the President may request, and Congress may enact, additional funding for selected activities, in the form of one or more supplemental appropriations measures (or supplementals). These have been used to provide funding for unforeseen needs, such as response to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, and recovery costs due to Hurricane Sandy in 2013. They have also been used as vehicles to provide funding for Overseas Contingency Operations. **Like regular appropriations bills, supplementals provide specific amounts of funding for individual accounts** rather than funding based on a rate of operations (like a CR).

One of the more interesting cases on this answered if a cop could place a GPS tracker on a car. The argument from the police side is, you have no expectation of privacy in public, like on public roads, so a GPS tracker is the equivalent of someone looking at you in public and following you. The counter argument is that police are not 24/7 monitors, and laws are handled by officers which are understood to be human and therefore don't have a 100% enforcement rate. The GPS tracker messes with this notion, and I think, but am sure, that this is some of the logic behind a tracker breaking the 4th amendment of unreasonable search and seizure.

So the DC statehood proposal would just leave the Federal 'District of Columbia' to consist of a few government buildings and parks, while the population is added into a new state The argument for is very simple - the people of DC are American citizens who overwhelmingly want to be a state, and they are currently being disenfranchised. DC does get to vote for President, but DC residents don't get Senators, a Representative, nor the same autonomy as normal states - Congress can invalidate DC laws at will For Puerto Rico, the argument against is that it's unclear if the islanders actually *want* statehood. There have been multiple referendums that have supported statehood, but those referendums were boycotted by the opposition and had low turnout. The island also hasn't applied for statehood yet. The argument for is that referendums have resulted in a majority for statehood (but with an asterix), and Puerto Ricans are disenfranchised.

Well, in the intervening years the statehooders managed to exploit the divided government of the 2004-2008 years (PPD governor, PNP legislature) to steal seats in these—much like the GOP just recently stole the Garland seat, except the PNP stole several seats. Gov. Fortuño (2009-2012) appointed **six out of nine** of the current members of that court. The 2012 referendum couldn't have been held in that form otherwise. You try to make this court as a bastion of liberalism when in fact **the PPD lowered the number of judges in the 1970's so that statehood supporters would't have majority when they finally had the opportunity to do so without partisan hacks. It then became a pseudo permanent judgeship in favor of the PPD for decades.** What the PNP actually did was put the number of seats **at 9 what it was initially when the Constitution was drafted in PR**.

"Those might be extreme examples, and maybe Mexico's an exemption in its adjacent proximity, but for Guatemala and other countries, it's probably fair to say that increasing wealth within a certain range makes emigration more likely. In the context of legal immigration, the US generally looks for means, skills etc. Basically trying to ensure that someone will be a net benefit and not a net drain. As part of the immigration process, my Guatemalan wife basically had to swear that she had no intention of seeking welfare benefits. And I had to swear/prove that I could provide for her and intended to do so. From there, it's easy to see how increasing the wealth of a population - at least within a certain range - might make them more likely to emigrate. In the context of illegal immigration, it's still easy to see something of a correlation between means and emigration. Again, Mexico might be an exception, but in Guatemala it's hardly ever the super-poor rural indigenous peoples who leave for the U.S. It tends to be the relatively wealthy (though still often very - even extremely - poor) latinos and mixed-race folks in the cities who emigrate. Obviously there's more to it than just wealth and standard of living. For example, a Spanish speaker has a much greater expectation of being able to communicate and understand things both in the U.S. and en route than e.g. someone who only speaks K'iche'. But wealth is still a factor. E.g. a wealthy K'iche' speaker would be more likely to be able to learn Spanish or English, and would therefore be more likely to consider emigration as a viable option.",t3_aaj373,NeutralPolitics

"Your confusion comes from  which basically models human self-identification as being on some sort of linear scale with say 0 being liberal and 10 being conservative or vice versa. Mathematical thinking matters - this construct is almost universally accepted but is absolutely a terrible way of modeling how people think. A better model is to look at things as, 'clustering' - similar to the Amazon Recommendation algorithm. E.g. there are millions of people out there, and if you gave them all a survey with 100 or so questions about their political opinions, let's say yes or no questions, and then had them fill that out - then you would be able to create a bunch of vectors modeling people based on a matrix of ones and zeros. Now, you have probably heard of the pythagorean theorem. What if I were to tell you that this works in n-dimensions? Well it does, whether you believe me or not...you can look that up. So basically you can calculate the, 'distance' between every single person in your giant spreadsheet, and then you can keep a record of the distance between all of these people and then rank them by distance from one another. From that, you can group all of the people together into various, 'clusters' of who are most similar to one another by reducing the number of variables used to describe similarities by weighting these similarities into 2-dimensions, and then just plotting them on a 2-d graph. How do we know how many clusters there are? Well, you can mathematically compare all of the various clustering groups to each other and see which has the least amount of overlap. What you will find is that there are likely a number of clusters for any given country, say 5-10 or so and that you can build stereotypes and mental models based off of those clusters which kind of make sense from a more, 'human' perspective. The socially liberal / fiscally conservative people would all cluster together and probably even have similar characteristics, while the libertarians would all cluster together and the green party / socialists would all cluster together and most likely be strangely close to the libertarians and both would be far away from the main-liners. How would you test the performance of this model? Based upon what people voted for. The liberatarians are going to vote for their Gary Johnson type candidate and the Green Parties are going to vote for Bernie Sanders, etc. If not, then your model was wrong. Hence brings up the question of electoral systems - American electoral systems highly favor two parties...that will influence people's decision making. Even if they are able to vote for the Bernie Sanders type candidate in the general election (e.g. Jill Stein) they may not do so because they may feel it is hopeless. Perhaps Brazil's electoral system is more, 'open' in terms of the chance of third parties winning...in the US it is basically nill because the people do not choose the President, the electoral college does, which is dependent upon the parties that are voted in. For example, in Minnesota one electoral vote went to Bernie Sanders, but that voter was immediately fired and replaced with someone who would vote for Hillary because he was appointed by the democratic party, and the democratic party had the power to fire him and replace him with someone who would vote the party line - people vote for a party, which then sends their representatives to vote for the President...popular vote does nothing.

"Well...no. If I remember this right (I promise to look this up later and edit as needed) that is certainly a big part of the background, though. The Khmer Rouge was around throughout the Vietnam War period, but was relegated to the forested mountain areas of the Northeast border area. It took them until the 1970 military coup agains the Cambodian monarch to gain support from both the usurped monarch and North Vietamese. The real power vacuum was created by the coup....and the issue was less of a vacuum and more of a major left/right split **edit** and major intervention from North Vietnam on behalf of the Khmer Rouge. So, why the coup? Cambodia became independent in the mid-1950's and was led by Prince Sihanouk (sp?), who was a sort of master of back-deal politics and the careful balancing of rightist and leftist ideologies within his government, but balancing that became difficult with the Vietnamese War happening on the border. Some were sympathetic of the Viet Cong; others deeply upset that the Viet Cong had opened up the country to conflict. Then there were economics issues with smuggling and electoral reforms that upset traditional politics, swinging voting advantage far to the right. A rightist who later sort of ran the coup became Prime Minister at this point. So, they now have a rightist government and a leader who is still trying to maintain a balance with a diminishing left. The coup was actually a result of the rightists intolerance for Sihanouk's tolerance of the Viet Cong activity inside Cambodia's borders. Mass anti-Vietnamese protests broke out in 1970 that morphed quickly into a civil war, with major backing for the Khmer Rouge coming from N. Vietanamese soldiers. Sihanouk also sided with the Khmer Rouge. In short, the bombing really wasn't the crux of the issue.",t3_a7nvm3,NeutralPolitics

"The interstate commerce clause is so broad that it's been held that Congress can regulate a farmer growing wheat for personal consumption because otherwise he would go out and buy the wheat from interstate commerce. This is such an interesting ruling historically. When you look at that line of cases, they overturned prior case law related to the commerce clause and instead went entirely the other direction, arguably too far in that direction (i.e., some things just aren't interstate commerce). And, the part that makes it interesting is that that line of cases came after FDR threatened the Supreme Court with a variety of things ranging from adding a bunch of justices or trying to get mandatory retirement rules in place. It was one of the most blatant political attacks on the independence of the judiciary in our nation's history in my opinion (albeit entirely within the rule of law).

"This got me thinking that, if in general rising wealth means more citizens have the means to migrate (which you provide evidence for, but presumably there are other factors overall), would this mean that falling wealth has the opposite effect? I've been struggling to find some sources that link if falling wealth reduces migration, but in digging around I consistently come across the same reasons for 'economic migrants' to leave their home country - unemployment and wealth disparity between the origin and destination countries. In looking around the , I found some helpful summaries giving some reasons for why migrants leave particular areas. This is just some tidbits on Western migration - there's a lot here for different regions. Mexico and Central America: However, within a context of improving economic conditions and rising educational levels in the country, as well as stricter immigration enforcement in the United States, Mexico is an increasingly significant destination country for international migrants. The total number of foreign-born persons in Mexico increased from around 970,000 in 2010 to nearly 1.2 million in 2015 – a majority of whom were Americans, but also an increasingly larger portion of whom were migrants from other Latin American and Caribbean countries.205 However, the United States is by far the most popular destination of Central American migrants – 78 per cent of Central American migrants lived in the United States in 2015, with 15 per cent residing in other countries in the region and in Mexico. The most prominent intraregional migrant corridors involve Nicaraguans, Panamanians and other Central Americans moving to Costa Rica for temporary or permanent labour, and Central Americans (primarily from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador) migrating to Belize because of instability and a lack of employment opportunities. South America: Fueled by economic and labour market disparities between countries, a majority of the region’s migrants move for work.222 Notably, South American economic restructuring, as well as increased demand for female migrants by service and care sectors, have also led to the feminization of intraregional movement. Emigration from South America is mostly related to work, fueled by economic crises and political instability in origin countries.227 The United States and Spain are the two largest destination countries of South American migrants, with 2.8 million and 1.8 million migrants residing in these two countries respectively.228 The countries with the highest numbers of emigrants residing outside of South America in 2015 were Colombia (around 1.4 million emigrants), followed by Brazil (1.3 million extraregional emigrants) and Ecuador (over 1 million extraregional emigrants).229 At the same time, reduced opportunities in labour markets abroad, as well as improved economic conditions in the region, are contributing to the return of many South American migrants and a decrease in the rate of extraregional migration.

"Yes, it is. From Wikipedia:  Over time, the meaning of the word 'liberalism' began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: 'In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies'... Unlike Europe and Latin America, the word 'liberalism' in North America almost exclusively refers to social liberalism. Around the 2008 election, the term progressive was revived and began to replace the term liberal. lt is pure hubris on the part of others to tell us we're using our own word wrong because it's not the way they use it.

">The U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA) was founded in 1946 and originally located at Fort Gulick in the Panama Canal Zone. The School aimed to instruct the armed forces of Latin America using training programs that were doctrinally sound and compatible with United States customs and traditions in a cost effective and militaristically professional way.[1] From 1961 (during the Kennedy administration), the School was assigned the specific Cold War goal of teaching 'anti-communist' counterinsurgency training to military personnel of Latin American countries.[2] At the time and in those places, the label 'communist' was, in the words of anthropologist Lesley Gill, '... an enormously elastic category that could accommodate almost any critic of the status quo.'[3]:10 During this period, Colombia supplied the largest number of students from any client country.[3]:17 >On September 21, 1984, the school was expelled from Panama under the terms of the Panama Canal Treaty. Prior to this expulsion, politicians and journalists in Panama had complained that civilian graduates from the school engaged in repressive and antidemocratic behavior.[4] In December of that year, the school reopened at Fort Benning, Georgia, as part of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Spanish was the official language of the school and although human rights training was a part of the program, many questioned the effectiveness of this curriculum. In 1989 the School set in place a requirement that a basic, sufficient block of human rights instruction would be 8 hours long.[1] Further international curriculum on human rights was included in the instruction, as were warnings about the penalties of human rights abuses.[5] Despite this required instruction, the School still utilized material from Spanish language training manuals that discussed methods of coercion against insurgents through execution and torture from 1982 until 1991. The Department of Defense released excerpts of these manuals in September 1996, prompting further criticism of and controversy surrounding the School.[1] >As the Cold War drew to a close around 1990, United States foreign policy shifted focus from 'anti-communism' to the War on Drugs, with narcoguerillas replacing 'communists'.[3]:10 This term was later replaced by 'the more ominous sounding 'terrorist''.[3]:10 Now, all elements of the School of the Americas are located at Fort Benning with the exception of the Helicopter School Battalion which is located at Fort Rucker, Alabama.[6] I'd also read through the graduates portion to see what these people were trained at the school to do, and what they did with their training.",t3_aaj373,NeutralPolitics

"Relevant part from the Federalist papers: &#x200B; >The indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy. This consideration has the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as still further to abridge its necessary independence. The extent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people of the State in their adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be obviated. &#x200B; It's a little hard to parse, but I believe the tl;dr of it is that they don't want a state government having authority that could affect how the federal government operates. Like, if that state didn't maintain their roads properly, that could actually stop the federal government from operating properly. Or, if that state objected to how the federal government was being run, they could take steps to make life worse for legislators (see  in New Jersey). &#x200B; That said, in the 21st century I feel there must be a better way of fixing these problems that doesn't deprive \~700,000 people of autonomy, not to mention a representation in Congress.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

If the GOP were forced to actually appeal to people outside of their rural minorities, they may come up with a platform that addresses rural needs while *also* not being consistently a minority of the general US population -- just like the Democrats have done.

"Hi again. Wow, you added a lot. I'm just going to ask that you make a couple more small adjustments. First, take another look at this phrase: As very neatly laid out in this Wikipedia section, the middle class started shrinking after his tax cuts... After reading it a few times, I realized you were referring to Reagan, but it's not clear as written. Please adjust it. I am confused as to why JFK's ideas helped the middle class, whereas Reagan's 'destroyed' it. This is a bit inflammatory to comply with Rule B. Try using a more neutral word than 'destroyed.' Also, now that you have so much more background, I'm going to suggest that you eliminate this part: Under Obama, the US lost the most workers it has in the last few decades. After steady gains during the Carter, Reagan and first Bush administration, the labor force participation rate peaked during the Clinton administration and has been declining since, with the steepest losses coming during the Obama years.  You can certainly leave it in if you wish, but I think it might be a distraction, because some respondents are probably going to point out that the labor participation rate is not directly related to the middle class and has been largely influenced by demographic factors: the baby boomers are retiring and young people are going to college instead of entering the workforce.

"Am a law student — this means nothing, really. The way federal courts work is that this rule only applies to this district in Texas. A District Court judge cannot make a ruling that changes the law for the whole Nation. Moving forward, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear this case and despite what President Trump wants, this will be overturned and remanded back to district court where they tell them to try again (aka rule for the defendant using the reasoning we just gave you). Plaintiff attempt to be heard before SCOTUS, but will refuse to grant certiorari, as this decision has already been made. The Court of Appeals will overturn this ruling by the District Court because it is very frowned upon for a CoA to make a decision that openly defies stare decisis. In the unlikely scenario that SCOTUS does grant cert, you can bank on them upholding the District Court’s decision. As SCOTUS does not (normally) grant cert to reaffirm their prior decisions, they only grant cert to change the existing legal landscape. However, I don’t really predict this will happen, even with a more conservative sitting bench. In the even more unlikely scenario where the 5th CoA upholds the district courts decision, SCOTUS would grant cert to tell them why they were wrong. Additionally, Nancy Pelosi’s tweet in that article is outrageous. Congress has no power or authority to interfere with court decisions. If the court says it is unconstitutional, congress must create a new law that does not violate the constitution, or they must change the constitution (the income tax was a good example of this in action).",t3_a6c04o,NeutralPolitics

"The dual mandate of the Federal Reserve is to combat inflation (price stability) and guide the economy towards full employment. During the Obama years, unemployment was much higher. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.

"in the US it is basically nill because the people do not choose the President, the electoral college does, which is dependent upon the parties that are voted in. I think it's more nuanced than just putting the blame on the electoral college (not saying you do, necessarily). The modern mechanics of the electoral college (i.e. winner of the state popular vote takes all the EC votes) functions absolutely contrary to its intended purpose and effect. Yes, the original intent of the EC was to put a barrier between the people (the mob) and the election of the president, but the idea was that the people of a state would choose capable and trusted electors who could represent their interests. From the : >The original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution: >1. Individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis. 2. Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting. 3. Candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president. 4. The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives. In actuality, two things led to the failure of this system working as intended: first, that the States were given the prerogative on how to select electors, and second, the development of political parties. The idea that States would send **all** their electors to votes for the State-wide winner was not anticipated by the Framers, but once political parties developed, it was a natural and inevitable outcome: any State that apportions electors differently loses most of their political power in choosing the President if all the other States do it that way. IMO, First Past the Post voting and the allowing of States to choose how to apportion electors have had a much greater effect on the current state of the EC and the two-party system than the EC itself. In hindsight, these factors made our current situation (or something very much like it) all but inevitable, but the Framers had no such benefit. They were essentially charting brand new waters, with only the British Parliament (and the Iroquois League) as their guidelines. ",t3_a92z8p,NeutralPolitics

"Even if I accept that you want a balance of power between the 'majority' and the 'minority,' to prevent the majority from simply overruling any of the 'minority''s interests, how do you formally define the 'minority'? As it is, our current system is set up to empower the 'minority' which lives in rural areas. But other types of minorities, such as racial/ethnic groups and LGBTQ populations, have no such special access. If empowering minorities is important, why do we only empower one specific type of minority? Especially when that empowered minority is all too happy to use their power to stomp on *other* minorities (exactly as you fear would happen if the majority were given full control). To put it another way, by picking *specific* minority groups to empower, while leaving others without special access, you're picking winners and losers and further exacerbating the gulf between different populations. I'm not entirely convinced that this outcome is better than disempowering all minorities (again, at the national level, if they form majorities in specific geographic regions then they should have some powers over those regions). Honestly, 'requiring a very large majority to make huge changes, so having 51% isn't enough to vote to kill the other 49%' seems like a pretty powerful measure to prevent too much unchecked majority power, perhaps moreso than picking arbitrary minority groups and giving them (and them alone) special power.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

This is why they were originally appointed by the state legislatures. It's also why I think 17A was a mistake. It tilted power too far one direction. Remember that at the time they were trying to convince 13 autonomous governments to give up power in forming a union. This was a concession that allowed those governments to have some say.

"Well for one, DC had a population of 601,767, and Puerto Rico had 3,726,157 according to the 2010 US census, which put them both above the state of Wyoming, which had a population of 563,767 on that same 2010 US census. Source This isn't obvious at all, but you shouldn't be citing 2010 Census numbers for Puerto Rico, since they are sorely out of date. The current population of Puerto Rico is a very uncertain number right now, because the statistical methods used to estimate it between censuses break down with the massive depopulation that has happened to the island in the past 10 years and that the hurricane accelerated. Recent estimates put the population at various points between 3.0 and 3.3 million. After the hurricane (Sep. 20, 2017) some 200-300K fled, so the population seems to have dipped from about 3.0 million by Dec. 2017 or Jan. 2018, then recovered somewhat with a wave of returnees for the next few months, and then started shedding population again. And there's another argument against statehood: it would probably result in even more mass displacement of Puerto Rico's population, to be replaced by Americans. Think of the sorry lot of native Hawaiians or Chicanos, who were basically turned into foreigners on their own ancestral homelands; that's what would happen to Puerto Ricans. Americans would move in to the island, take over and change everything to suit themselves, and exclude Puerto Ricans from their society.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"True, but impeachment proceedings are going to be, ultimately, rooted in the law. I know that some people have said that the Senate can remove a President for any reason whatsoever, which is essentially true, but if the proceeding is going to have substantial political support it needs to be grounded in more than just 'we don't like the guy.' That being said, shoving the blame onto Cohen is a great defense here. Trump is not a lawyer, and he relies on lawyers for compliance with the law. Cohen has already proven himself to be something less than a boy scout by lying to Congress and investigators. The perfect guy to palm the blame onto. The argument that Cohen screwed up and that he's trying to shift the blame to get out of charges isn't a bad one. And besides, the argument that a key witness is making up facts in order to get a reduced sentence is a tale as old as time. The fact that Cohen had admittedly lied in the past does not make him a shining beacon of credibility now that he has a personal incentive to lie now. 'He'll say whatever he needs to say to benefit himself' is a line that will certainly be said in the near future by Trump's legal team. The practical political reality is that for Trump to be removed from office, a substantial number of Republican senators are going to have to turn on him. If there's a plausible 'out' for Trump, they're not going to do that. The only way that the Senate will get enough votes for removal is for there to be no conceivable excuse for Trump.",t3_a49220,NeutralPolitics

"It's strange. The 90s were a more polarized time, looked at objectively: : An October 1990 New York Times article by Richard Bernstein is credited with popularizing the term.[14][16][17][41][42] At this time, the term was mainly being used within academia: 'Across the country the term p.c., as it is commonly abbreviated, is being heard more and more in debates over what should be taught at the universities'.[12] Nexis citations in 'arcnews/curnews' reveal only seventy total citations in articles to 'political correctness' for 1990; but one year later, Nexis records 1,532 citations, with a steady increase to more than 7,000 citations by 1994.[41][43] In May 1991, The New York Times had a follow-up article, according to which the term was increasingly being used in a wider public arena: What has come to be called 'political correctness,' a term that began to gain currency at the start of the academic year last fall, has spread in recent months and has become the focus of an angry national debate, mainly on campuses, but also in the larger arenas of American life. — 'Political Correctness: New Bias Test?' – Robert D.

"It is my opinion that illegal immigration contributes to a substantial proportion of the divide in American politics. Given that according to Pew the plurality of illegal aliens identify or would vote as democrat, and given that our popular vote margin was about 3 million in the late general election, and given that according to a new study from Yale that proports new estimates of the number of illegal aliens residing in America to be around 23 million, and given the evidence for voter fraud a la Broward county, Texas, and ballot harvesting in California, Project Veritas, it's not hard to see how the influx of people who do not reside here legally yet may potentially have enough numbers to influence the outcome of national elections (certainly state and local elections) could be a reality. However I don't think that's the main source of the political divide. I think the main source is leftist academia which provides the progressive rhetoric fuel for the mass media which is overwhelmingly (90%+) negative against President Trump (three left leaning sources for lefties in denial) and the ideals of conservatives (not necessarily the RINOs in the republican party but I digress). In this study by Econ Journal Watch which surveyed voter registration of over 7,000 professors at over 40 leading universities, liberal left professors outnumbered conservative professors by an astounding 12:1 ratio. These are the factories for the thought leaders and they control the modern discourse, dictating to the public what the outrage du jour should be, from fat acceptance, to open borders (if you're against illegal immigration you're a racist) to trans acceptance to Muslim acceptance, to enforcing gender quotas and race quotas in school (sorry harvard Asians) and the boardroom (California's new gender quota law for PRIVATE business), to sanctuary cities thumbing their nose at federal immigration law, to pushing for gun control following school shootings, enforcing gendered language under penalty of hate crime (origins in Canada's C16), to promoting antifa (a domestic terror riot group) as Nazi smashing patriots (when according to an august '17 study by SLPC there are between 5000-8000 Nazis in all of the US) on and on and on, the media parrots these topics from the morally virtuous perspective, disallowing any disagreement or else you're labelled as a racist, hateful bigot Nazi. The left allows no divergence of thought. Just look at how they treated Kanye West for even daring to consider thinking for himself. This is where the real divide comes from in my opinion and I'm not sure how you could argue otherwise.

"If you consider a Free Market where all externalities are priced, I don't know how you wouldn't consider Market Socialism using a Free Market. The problem is, Free Market^TM is used to mean not pricing externalities in the US. If I make 100 USD and cause 500 USD of damages, in a market pricing externalities properly I would have lost 400 USD. This isn't covered in most 'Free Market' ideologies, they just let someone make 100 USD and everyone else has to deal with the 400 USD in damage. Maybe it helps that at a base-level Socialism is just worker-control of the means of production. That idea doesn't go against any level of market intervention. Now most Socialist aren't in favor of a Free Market, but that doesn't mean there isn't a Socialist in favor of it while still being Socialist. ",t3_a92z8p,NeutralPolitics

"That's not correct. Here it is conceded that the statute, before the amendment, was entirely valid. When passed, it expressed the will of the Legislature which enacted it. Without an express repeal, a different Legislature undertook to create an exception, but, since that body sought to express its will by an amendment which, being unconstitutional, is a nullity and, therefore, powerless to work any change in the existing statute, **that statute must stand as the only valid expression of the legislative intent.**  Courts do not have to scrap the law altogether if before the amendment it was a valid, constitutional law.

"Interesting about slingshots, thats pretty silly. I mean, you can use them for sport same as anything like a bow and arrow, and they were invented as a hunting weapon. My dad grew up using a sling on squirrels, etc. Of course guns arent unrestricted though. Basically every country, USA included has a few thousand firearms regulations applying to all sorts of stuff. Even the USA is only 'unregulated' by comparison. There are laws saying you can't have more than 2 slugs in the chamber, and no more than 3 bullets in the clip (and one in the chamber for a total of 4) at a time As far as I can tell, there is a limit on 2+1 in the chamber for small game, 3+1 in the chamber for big game, and those laws are hunting specific. They do not apply to general ownership of firearms, and you could use the same guns at the range with no magazine limiters. Most countries limit guns used in hunting to a certain round count in certain conditions, without it having impact on general ownership. Ie in canada waterfowl shotguns can only hold 2+1, but when you get home, or take it to the range, or hunt big game instead you can take the plug out and have unlimited rounds in the same pump action shotgun(as an example). Many people, even gun owners arent fully aware of these laws though, Ive known a few that didnt realize their clay hunting shotgun could actually hold 5+1 with the plug out legally.

">Ask your friends today what he was impeached for? 'For lying about sexual relations with Monica, but it was mostly just political' The point is that few have any idea of what was in the Starr Report or happened at Cohen's trial. Ask anyone you know and generally they will all tell you they both were about sex. I'm going to push back again, no one is saying Trump should be impeached for sex. The reality is that Cohen has said that he committed two campaign finance felonies at the direction of the president and that AMI has corroborated that it was specifically an effort to prevent damage to the campaign and election. The 'average Joe' explaination isn't that he had sex with someone he shouldn't of have. It's that he and his lawyer 'paid of a porn star and covered it up'. Some others will also know that 'he works in tandem with a tabloid magazine to cover up negative stories'. I'm just going to reiterate that the conduct that Clinton acted with was against the office of the presidency whether it was the lies or using the power and authority of his office to woo an intern. Trump's conduct was known before hand and the American public signed on along with it. It's not even clear that if this knowledge had been known prior that it would of had a significant effect on election day.

But imbuing multinational organizations with power is always a balancing act, because the citizens and leaders of the member countries won't usually stand for being subject to rules imposed by people who are not their chosen leaders or even residents of their countries. Giving the organization power, especially military power, is a threat to the sovereignty of individual nations. No matter where you live, imagine if your leaders and the populace largely supported a policy, but were prevented from implementing it because some big wigs across the world said you can't, under threat they'll send armies to enforce their will.

Personally I think depriving citizens of representation in federal government is an extraordinary political measure that should be narrowly crafted to achieve its goals. As it stands today, I don't think we have cleared that bar. The fact that some people choose to live with a lack of representation is not an argument that the lack of representation is proper. The rest of your post is well-taken, though.

"Regarding statehood for Puerto Rico, the main argument against it is that **the Puerto Rican people do not want it**. There have been a number of referendums on this matter on the island and the results for statehood were as follows: * **Puerto Rican status referendum, 1967**: I don't like to use Wikipedia as a source,  of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. >The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. So congress in theory could vote tomorrow to make Puerto Rico a state! Some statehood supporters argue that the last referendum in 2017 showed overwhelming popular support in the island for this option, given that 97 percent of those who went to the polls voted for this option. If only 23 percent of eligible voted cast ballots, those who chose not to participate when they had a chance had to accept the will of those who did. I honestly sympathize with this line of thinking, because in a democracy you can chose not to participate in an election (as millions regularly do in U.S.) and nobody questions their legitimacy. However, as it is **our congress** who decides if Puerto Rico becomes a state or not we have to give a lot of weight to the fact that **Puerto Ricans are not endorsing this option when they have the opportunity to do so**. As long as the U.S. exists in its current form, statehood is forever; there is no way out once you are in. Puerto Ricans want in as a state, with the full rights and obligations as the current 50 states? Then say so, loud and clear. They haven't, and so the US congress should not welcome them as a new state. &#x200B;",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"Great question, to give a quick rundown the answer is a firm...not likely. In DoD we rely on budgets passed up through the Executive branch with ultimate approval in the hands of Congress. They limit our spending via Appropriation Codes and we also use internal DoD and branch codes to limit what that money can be used for. This means money can only be used legally in certain ways. There is some unassigned dollars each year, but nothing close to the money that has been requested for the wall. In this example everything that would fall under a combination of  codes that were not allocated to specific initiatives could be moved around to build this wall (MILPERS wouldn't likely count here as no one is being hired). There is unlikely enough there to support the building of such a wall for over a month though and with lead times to acquire materials this likely just would create a fiasco over the Presidential Budget which is currently being worked through each agency for submission. Also someone brought up Posse Comitatus and then completely misunderstood it. That act would hamper, not help a President trying to deploy US troops to advance their domestic policy....until a terrorist attack does occur. I don't think anyone is silly enough to argue rocks being thrown as a terrorist attack unless they get towards the 90kg being thrown over 300m range.

"I think it all depends on your assumptions. For example, I assume that lowering healthcare costs without lowering healthcare outcomes is good. Obviously pharma companies would not agree, their goal is to maximize revenue and profit. I'm not going to say I know all the answers, but one should ask themselves, what does DTC do for the whole system? Does it improve healthcare outcomes (if so, why does the USA have worse outcomes than many other countries?)? Probably not. Does it increase the revenue of a specific company? Probably, otherwise they wouldn't do it. But what do you mean that pharma companies use advertising to generate US profits to 'compensate?' Do you mean that they move more product in the USA because of advertisement, and how does it follow that this is a good thing, given that we all pay for this with insurance and taxes? If no marketing would cost them revenue and 'cripple' their brands, then I submit that their medications are pointlessly prescribed anyway. Let me tell you this, if I go to the doctor in Europe (for example) with Disease A and they prescribe Drug X, the company that makes the drug makes money. That is to say, all sales of Drug X in Europe are being done with the educated counsel of a doctor. If Drug X sells at a faster rate in the USA, and it's because of marketing, then it's cases of patients specifically requesting Drug X even though it might be more expensive (for all of us since we all pay indirectly) or even though it's totally pointless.

The Sunday newspaper said that at the Athens headquarters of the Joint United States Military Aid Assistance Group Mr. Papadopoulos is known among senior staff members as “the first C.I.A. agent to become premier of a European country.” More recently Boris Yeltsin was considered to be a US asset, with billions of US backed loans being spent to influence and insure his election.  In the run-up to the election, Russia was granted a huge US-backed IMF loan that – as the New York Times noted at the time – was “expected to be helpful to President Boris N Yeltsin in the presidential election”. Yeltsin relied on US political strategists – including a former aide to Bill Clinton – who had a direct line back to the White House.

"This copypasta isn't exactly an answer to your question, but it does outline what she was doing and who she was hanging with: >Republican operative Paul Erickson is closely linked to alleged Russian agent Maria Butina. Butina, who was indicted in July 2018 for conspiring to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States, sought to build relationships with American politicians and establish a “back channel” to “penetrate the U.S. national decision-making apparatus.” Butina has pleaded not guilty. She worked with both Russian central banker Alexander Torshin and Erickson. Erickson and Butina were reportedly romantically involved, and Erickson was aware of Butina’s attempt to influence the Republican party. Erickson sent an introductory email to both Butina and Gordon in September 2016, noting that Butina was “playing a crucial role in the Trump transition effort and would be an excellent addition to any of the U.S./Russia friendship dinners to occasionally hold” and referring to her as the “special assistant to the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia.” >Erickson was involved in additional contacts as well. In May 2016, Torshin proposed a meeting between Trump and Putin, and this request was passed through Erickson to campaign advisor Rick Dearborn. Dearborn, incidentally, also received a “similar proposal” from Rick Clay, who was described as “an advocate for Christian causes.” Dearborn forwarded Clay’s proposal to Kushner, who turned it down. While these contacts are not included in the list above due to the intermediaries between Trump officials and Russian officials, they provide even more supporting evidence of a widespread effort to establish lines of communication between the Russians and the Trump campaign. >September-October 2016: Gordon emailed Butina and Republican operative Paul Erickson with “a clip of a recent appearance he had made on RT.” This was in response to an email from Erickson to Gordon and Butina, in which Erickson noted that Gordon was “playing a crucial role in the Trump transition effort” and that Butina was a “special assistant to the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia.” >September-October 2016: Butina responded to Gordon’s email, inviting him to a dinner hosted by conservative writer and Rockefeller heir George O’Neill Jr. As the Washington Post noted, “prosecutors cited the dinners organized by O’Neill, described in court documents as ‘person 2,’ as part of Butina’s efforts to influence thought leaders.” >September-October 2016: Gordon responded to Butina’s email, declining the dinner invitation but inviting her for drinks and to a concert. In his correspondence with Butina, he reportedly “included a link to a September 2016 Politico story reporting that he was a part of Trump’s growing transition effort.” October 2016: Gates had another contact with the unnamed individual who had ongoing ties to Russian intelligence.  >J.D. Gordon is a former Pentagon official and Republican operative who became the Trump campaign's Director of National Security in March 2016. In his capacity as one of the campaign's foreign-policy advisors, Gordon successfully advocated for removing language from the Republican Party platform calling on the U.S. to supply 'lethal defensive weapons' to assist the government of Ukraine's efforts to repel Russian forces attempting to annex Crimea. The change, which was reportedly the only one requested by the Trump campaign, representing a major divergence from the previous GOP position, which frequently criticized President Obama for not supplying Ukraine with lethal defensive weapons; Gordon has said that Trump himself requested the new language. Gordon later met with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the Republican National Convention.  *Department of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Monday, July 16, 2018* >Russian National Charged in Conspiracy to Act as an Agent of the Russian Federation Within the United States >A criminal complaint was unsealed today in the District of Columbia charging a Russian national with conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General. >Maria Butina, 29, a Russian citizen residing in Washington D.C., was arrested on July 15, 2018, in Washington, D.C., and made her initial appearance this afternoon before Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was ordered held pending a hearing set for July 18, 2018. >According to the affidavit in support of the complaint, from as early as 2015 and continuing through at least February 2017, Butina worked at the direction of a high-level official in the Russian government who was previously a member of the legislature of the Russian Federation and later became a top official at the Russian Central Bank. This Russian official was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control in April 2018. >The court filings detail the Russian official’s and Butina’s efforts for Butina to act as an agent of Russia inside the United States by developing relationships with U.S. persons and infiltrating organizations having influence in American politics, for the purpose of advancing the interests of the Russian Federation. The filings also describe certain actions taken by Butina to further this effort during multiple visits from Russia and, later, when she entered and resided in the United States on a student visa. The filings allege that she undertook her activities without officially disclosing the fact that she was acting as an agent of Russian government, as required by law.  >Maria Butina was a special assistant to Alexander Torshin. She claimed to help the Trump campaign communicate with Russians, although these claims are unverifed. Butina has strong ties to the NRA through her own Russian organization, the Right to Bear Arms, and is also linked to Republican operative **Paul Erickson**.

" The Constitution doesn't explicitly say powers of the three branches of the federal government are separated, but I see someone else has provided you a link to Article 2. The legal validity of calling something a 'machinegun' in 'federal law' rests on laws passed by the federal government's legislature, Congress - - neither he president nor his executive agencies can simply rewrite statutes. I *suppose* someone could say this is a matter of Chevron deference run amok and that this is a statutory matter, not explicitly a constitutional one, but; The very first article of the Constitution also says; *all* legislative powers are vested in Congress, and article two says that executive powers are vested in the president. This is pretty clear to me. I don't think anyone could've looked at the presentment clause in Article 1, for instance, and the line item veto act of 1996 and not seen *how* it would be ruled *unconstitutional* by the Supreme Court ( a 6-3 decision tho!); but it was **was** held that the plaintiffs (appellees ackshually) had standing to challenge *constitutionality* and that the act violated the Constitution's presentment clause of Article 1. This isn't even necessarily a balance of powers thing, in my mind; this is just about **how** something gets legal force behind it. From Clinton 1996: 'Second, having concluded that the Act’s cancellation provisions violate Article I, §7, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider the District Court’s alternative holding that the Act impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of Government. Third, this decision rests on the narrow ground that the Act’s procedures are not authorized by the Constitution. *If this Act were valid, it would authorize the President to create a law whose text was not voted on by either House or presented to the President for signature.* That may or may not be desirable, but it is surely *not a document that may “become a law” pursuant to Article I, §7.* If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will play a different role, such change must come through the Article V amendment procedures. Similarly, the entire basis of BATFE being an executive branch body that regulates and even bans 'Machineguns' rests on Congress authorizing them to do so because of the 1986 FOPA and 1934 NFA. This came from a bill, just a bill, on capitol hill, who became a law! There's a procedure for doing that, and it isn't the executive agencies reaching back into the law, altering the language itself, and reinterpreting pretty clear statute that Congress has passed, just because Congress isn't willing to pass a new statute. That's, IMHO, unconstitutional! ",t3_a7mqzr,NeutralPolitics

">lowering taxes has to follow the same rules as raising them. You can't pass one law that uniformly taxes everyone, then repeal the tax only for specific groups in a way that violates the 14th amendment. How exactly does setting the penalty for failing to have insurance to $0 as Congress did not apply uniformly to everyone? I guess I just can't get around this fundamentally bizzare mindset. Law A is legal. Law B amends Law A in an illegal way. Law B is fine, Law A needs to be overturned. I mean, if Congress passed a law saying the US Olympic Team doesn't need to pay any taxes the year of the Olympics, and that law was found to be Unconstitutional, would you expect the court to abolish all taxes because they they all became Unconstitutional, or abolish just the one law that caused the problem? It was not an amendment. It was a change to the text of the law. An amendment leaves the existing text alone and adds to it. That is the fundamental problem. Once Congress lawfully removes the text, a court cannot put it back it. Doing so is exercising legislative prerogative. If you believe the change was unconstitutional, you have to explain how said change *is* unconstitutional. Does Congress have the authority to *change* that part of the law and if not, why not? The example provided makes no sense. We are talking about a specific act of Congress - not all acts of Congress. This court action only impacted **THIS** Act of Congress. Your scenario would have the judge declare all laws unconstitutional because this one was and that is not what happened. or abolish just the one law that caused the problem? That is exactly what the Judge did. He declared the ACA, a single law, Unconstitutional. ------------------------------------------------------------ Difference between an amendment and a change: Law Original: Student aid is made available in the sum of $20,000 per year to citizens of Ohio. A Change: Student aid is made available in the sum of $0 per year to the citizens of Ohio. Changing it back requires a court to **ADD** text to the law. An Amendment to the law Amendment B: School resource aid shall be provided to the schools in Ohio in the sum of $50,000 A court can remove the Amendment without impacting the original law because they are **NOT ADDING** text back into the law. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Essentially, if you can not fix the Constitutionality of the law by removing a portion of it (severing - assuming it is severable) then the entire law must be declared Unconstitutional. A court may **not** add text to the law to fix the Constitutionality of it. ",t3_a6c04o,NeutralPolitics

"Very interesting discussion here to which I would like to add an anecdote. I spent over a decade as a hard line liberal, fought against Bush in 2000 and 2004, and voted for Obama in 2008. During this period of time, I felt Fox News was straight up propaganda and it disgusted me. In hindsight, I think this polarization was a big reason I fought against them so hard. Then I watched the left not only adopt all these tactics, but seriously intensify and institutionalize them. I ended up a disillusioned libertarian. Over time I have found that the modern GOP represents my politics the best, and I can hardly stomach what the DNC has to offer anymore. This has left many Americans in an odd place. I will never trust the DNC again for the rest of my life. I will never trust the mass media again (because I have caught them lying to me). And I don't trust the GOP either, the only reason I voted GOP was because Trump has raw authenticity. But the larger point remains, in this hyper polarized environment, with media that has abandoned all sense of fairness/truth in reporting, what happens next? Case in point: google 'is biased media the cause of polarization'. The first page of results are generally articles persuading that polarization is a 'right-wing' problem. This seems nuts to me because studies such as the one below concluded that 2/3 of Hilary Clinton's loss was due to 'Obama-Trump voters' or 'Obama Republicans'.  There seems to be a lot of conservatives willing to cross the aisle in the voting booth when it suits them. That doesn't make much of a case for brainwashed right wing voters. In general, it seems to me that both sides are polarized, and the source is dishonest media with hidden agendas to blame. We still have a lot of people thinking for themselves, but the media is focused on indoctrinating rather honestly reporting the news. Once people are indoctrinated, they move to social media for validation and seek out echo chambers to reinforce their beliefs. It is quickly becoming a scary reality. ",t3_a3i7ai,NeutralPolitics

"Most of what you just said is pretty blatantly false, especially since you're using the term 'the left' which encompasses a pretty huge number of people with different beliefs on different issues. The majority of 'the left' are against illegal immigration, but are supportive of legal immigration. They are not so much against deportations as they are against how illegals are being treated, specifically the activities that violate basic human rights and that appear to qualify as genocide according to the Geneva convention.  >Definition in Article 2(e): Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. The court case against family separations made it clear that the US government had no intention of returning some of these children to their parents. The US govt had to request extensions of the deadline because they did not have a system in place to identify and return them. By not tracking the children's identities with the parents in the first place, it made it clear that there was no intent to return them when they were taken.   Some on 'the left' do demand amnesty for illegals in our country, but the majority only support it in certain situations, like for children brought illegally where they had no choice. If a person was brought as a child and then became an adult who has a clean criminal record and is serving in the military, they believe those people should be granted amnesty. Most people also forget that humans figured out how to get around walls thousands of years ago, so simply building a wall would do little to stop the flow of illegals. Walls don't work if they are not monitored by humans, so you would need to build 'guard towers' at regular intervals for this purpose. It would be far more effective and less expensive to patrol the border with aircraft or drones fitted with thermal cameras. I'm not sure how one can call human monitoring of the border 'fascist' either. A wall would be destructive to the environment as well, like with blocking the paths of migrating animals.   Then there's also the issue of private property. Many of the people who own property on the border are not willing to sell for a wall. In some cases, building a fence or wall actually makes the problem worse.  >Kimbro, who lives in Cochise County, Arizona, said roads built to facilitate fence construction have attracted drug trafficking, as they have given smugglers better access to the border. She said there’s no need for more fence, let alone a wall. >“The government has to quit throwing border security around and disrespecting American citizens,” said Kimbro, who for 30 years has been the face of firearms manufacturer Sturm, Ruger Co. as its so-called Ruger Girl. “I don’t care what you build. People are going to come through. Vehicles come more now than they used to when we had barbed-wire fence.”",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

I think I know how you vote now ... but seriously, all kidding aside, this era has been marked by what appears to many to be partisan votes by the Court because certain decisions have come down that way but I think it's been underrated how often they actually agree.  We make a big deal out of the close ones because ... well, they're close and as such likely fall on important fault lines dealing with how our constitution should be applied. Often times these are values based considerations (e.g. Roe v. Wade's line of cases, Hobby Lobby, Citizen's United, etc.) that could fall either way depending on how you look at the issue. My point about the independence of the judiciary wasn't really about that and, admittedly, is really just me meandering about on related topics. The point has more to do with an instance in which the Court clearly *changed* its tune on an important issue following the application of external stimuli by another branch. That's one reason I perked up back when there discussions that Trump might try to apply a mandatory retirement age to the justices and have perked up so much to some of the radical left's call to impeach Trump and remove justices or add justices or any of the myriad of other thoughts that have been trotted out (again). So, the thing that catches my eye is when the judiciary feels so threatened that it changes it's stance on things.

"This actually gets at the local power vs. national power question: to the extent that national power is strong, by definition the union acts as a single unit, not a collection of sovereign states. If they're really all separate states with very different inherent needs that must be treated as equals, why have a strong central (that is, national) government in the first place? Going full-circle to my initial comment in this thread, it's interesting to compare the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution. The former created a very weak national government, with most power lying with the states, while the latter was more balanced, trying to give a greater portion of power to the national government. The Articles of Confederation starts with 'we, the undersigned Delegates of the States,' while the Constitution famously starts with 'we the People of the United States.' This suggests a rather different tone as to who is supposed to be represented at the national level: the states or the people. Of course, there's also the historical perspective: at the outset, the United States needed to extend more powers to the small states because otherwise they wouldn't join. There was no compelling reason to think that membership in the United States would be worth it absent that extra power, and in any event the federal government wasn't *that* powerful. In the intervening centuries, the federal government has taken on more responsibilities (income taxes, the commerce clause, etc.), while the benefits of being part of the Union are more obvious.

">As President Trump names U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton his next national security advisor, NPR uncovers a 2013 video Bolton recorded for The Right to Bear Arms, a Russian gun rights group with close ties to the National Rifle Association and a connection to Vladimir Putin. The episode, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the common cause that Russian and American gun rights groups were forming in the years leading up to the 2016 election through former National Rifle Association president David Keene. Keene appointed Bolton to the NRA's international affairs subcommittee in 2011. Russian politician Alexander Torshin helped establish The Right to Bear Arms and cultivate ties with American gun rights groups including the NRA. As a Putin ally, Torshin served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than a decade, and also spent time on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia's internal security service. >The Bolton video appears to be another plank in a bridge built by Russia to conservative political organizations inside the United States. It's unclear why Russian leaders wanted to curry favor with the NRA, but Torshin and Keene appeared to have developed close ties over in the years prior to the 2016 election. It's a relationship that has outsized importance now that the FBI is reportedly investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, as McClatchy reported in January. The NRA has denied wrongdoing. YouTube experimental ad with Cambridge Analytica -  another ad -  One of Bolton's SuperPac Expenditures was to Cambridge Analytica for $362,000.  - so, the Mercers give to Bolton's SuperPac which pays their Cambridge Analytica for services, is that how it works?  >Russian politician Alexander Torshin said his ties to the NRA provided him access to Donald Trump and the opportunity to serve as a foreign election observer in the United States during the 2012 election. The difference in the case of Torshin is that for the first time, a Russian mafia boss – at least one identified as such by the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor – is within the circle of support of the new president of the United States. As well as being a powerful banker, a leader of President Putin’s political party (United Russia) and his trusted ally, and a senator between 2001 and 2015 (in addition to being chairman of the upper house of the Russian parliament between May 19 and September 21, 2011), he is, according to the investigation carried out by the Spanish security forces, also a boss of a notorious criminal organization known as Taganskaya.  >Alexander Torshin (sometimes spelled Aleksandr Torshin) is the deputy governor of the Russian Central bank and reportedly tried to arrange a meeting between Putin and then-candidate Trump in May 2016. Torshin also offered to meet with Trump himself at the 2016 NRA convention. This offer made its way to Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn, who passed this email along to Kushner, who reportedly declined the offer. Torshin has strong links to the Kremlin, as he previously served in Russian Parliament and sat on a government council alongside the director of the FSB. Although Spanish authorities have accused him of money laundering and being linked to the Russian mafia, Torshin has denied these accusations. Trump ultimately did not attend the 2016 NRA convention, but Donald Trump Jr. did attend and was reportedly introduced to Torshin. Torshin has also claimed he met Trump at the 2015 NRA convention, but the White House denied this meeting. President Trump reportedly planned to meet with Torshin in February 2017, but this meeting was canceled due to concerns over Torshin’s ties to the Russian mafia.  >The official explanation fell apart as Trump repeatedly admitted he fired Comey to impede the Russia investigation. On May 10, the day after firing Comey, Trump met privately in the Oval Office with Kislyak and the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, to whom he described the former FBI Director as “crazy, a real nut job” and bragged that firing Comey had “taken off” the “great pressure” the investigation had created. On May 11, Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt he had planned to fire Comey over “this Russia thing” regardless of Rosenstein’s conclusion. (Rosenstein later confirmed in a closed-door Senate briefing that he knew Trump intended to fire Comey before writing the letter.)  >Lavrov's May 31 visit -- his first to North Korea since 2009 -- was seen as an attempt by Moscow to ensure its voice is heard in Pyongyang's diplomatic overtures with the United States and South Korea.

"Ok. So what is the problem with voting against it then? There is no option in the 2012 and 2017 ballots that says 'no' or 'none of the above,' nor any mechanism for the public to get an option or proposal put into the ballot that they support. An analogy I use in another comment here is as if anti-abortion politicians put up a state ballot on 'infanticide' with these two options and nothing more: 1. It shall be a capital crime to kill any child unborn or born. 2. Children unborn, or born but less than 1 year old, may be killed without penalty. What the hell are pro-choicers—who favor legal abortion but oppose actual infanticide—supposed to vote on that ballot? 1. If they vote for #1, the anti-abortionists will count them as agreeing to an abortion ban. 2. If they vote for #2, the anti-abortionists will count them as agreeing to infanticide. It's a rigged ballot: 'heads I win, tails you lose.' The status referendums in Puerto Rico since 1998 have been a (much subtler) version of that. The pro-Puerto Rico voters can't cast an effective vote because the statehooders wrote the whole set of alternatives to their advantage. The patriots who wish to vote 'against statehood' as you propose would be like pro-choicers voting for infanticide in my hypothetical ballot. The politics of the matter is that to hold a status referendum you need to get a supermajority of the Puerto Rican political spectrum to agree on the terms of the referendum ahead of time. If the treacherous statehooder minority imposes the terms, that's not actually democracy, that's election rigging.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

This goes for both Democrats and Republicans. Being POTUS in this day in age seems a hell of a lot more challenging than being POTUS before Obama strictly because of social media.

"And that ammendment would seem to prove that the ACA and the tax mandate are severable. Counter to the current argument that if the tax mandate doesn't exist. I understand that. The court would still have a decision on whether or not to take the case *despite* the change. But the argument is predicated on the tax being 'inseverable' The amendment itself would seem to be evidence that it can be severed without the rest falling apart - but I understand that this case is trying still to say the same by not addressing the amendment directly but the now-lack-thereof tax mandate, on the assumption that's the only legal standing the whole thing stood upon. When really it was just the only aspect of the ACA the supreme court *happened to consider*. ___ Here's their argument: 1) When the ACA was originally challenged, it was argued that if the individual mandate was struck, the whole law had to go--because Congress envisioned the individual mandate as balancing out the insurance market in a way to accommodate other provisions (like prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions). If you struck the individual mandate, the argument goes, the whole law would have to fall. 2) The Supreme Court held that the individual mandate was not unconstitutional because it was a tax. 3) Because the Supreme Court did not take issue with the individual mandate, it did not need to decide whether the individual mandate was judicially severable from the rest of the ACA. 4) Congress amended the ACA in the tax bill such that the individual mandate is now toothless. It is no longer a tax. It is an empty letter. 5) Because the individual mandate is no longer a tax, it has lost its constitutional justification. It is unconstitutional. 6) The (toothless, non-revenue-producing) individual mandate is essential to the rest of the ACA, and it would be judge-made legislation to strike the individual mandate and keep the rest. The mandate is not severable, and the whole law falls. ___ TLDR: They aren't arguing the federal government cannot regulate healthcare they are arguing that without the mandate the whole thing is unconstitutional. The subsidies, the pre-existing conditions. They conflated that in 2012 it court ruled that the Tax Penalty allowed Congress to excercize the Individual Mandate since it involved a tax.

Those lines on a map aren't imaginary, whatever the memes might say, they mark exactly where sovereign entities believe they have both a desire and an ability to enforce their laws.

If you want to force a sovereign entity to do something it doesn't want to, you have to go to war. In this instance, assuming that the US and Ukraine are telling the truth about what happened, Russia broke international law, but all that means is that sovereign entities that had agreed that was the international law have a valid reason in the eyes of the international community to do something to try and force Russia to comply with international law.

Congressional statutes that create these agencies generally provide that the agency heads may be removed by the president only for good cause—sometimes specified as “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” This kind of statutory limitation on presidential removal (and hence presidential control) of the heads of independent agencies was upheld by the Supreme Court in the face of a constitutional challenge by Franklin Roosevelt, in a landmark decision arising out of a collision between Roosevelt and the holdover head of the FTC. The Court agreed with Congress that entities exercising quasi-legislative (rulemaking) and quasi-judicial (adjudication) functions, based in theory on apolitical expertise, may be given some structural independence from the president.",t3_a8mtoc,NeutralPolitics

The whole point of the senate and house is that in the house the majority by population will hold more votes while the senate gives more votes to those living in rural areas so that their interests are not ignored in favor of people hundreds of miles away with entirely different values and concerns. Currently it happens that the Republican party is the party of choice for voters in smaller population states that would otherwise have their voice drowned out by those who lived in population dense states like California and New York. Rule by majority is fair on the surface, but it silences everyone who lives outside of a city because their issues don't line up with the issues faced by those in the city. This is also a large part of why the federal government initially operated with more restrictions than it currently does. This allowed states to have more choice in how they were run, which provided people who lived in more rural areas a voice in how they were to be governed rather than allowing the larger states to govern the entire country. I, personally, would prefer a system closer to that especially with how divisive the country has become in the gap between urban centers and the rest of the country. As an example of this gap, in the 2016 election Donald Trump  in addition to 1 of the 4 electoral votes from Maine. Despite winning electoral votes from 50% more states than Hillary Clinton, Trump still ended up losing the overall popular vote by a narrow margin. Even looking closer in states like Illinois where Trump only earned 38.76% of the vote compared to Clinton's 55.83% of the vote, Trump only lost in 12 of the 102 counties. He won in 88.2% of the counties in the state, yet still lost the state by 17.07% of the overall vote. This is where the concerns of many conservative voters lie since geographically the VAST majority of the country votes conservative. Unfortunately for them, however, the population density of cities mean that in many cases their voices are drowned out and their concerns fall on deaf ears. This is part of why I believe politics has become so increasingly divisive over the years, as cities continue to grow in population, because the large number of people who vote according the concerns of a very small geographic region (a city) are capable of entirely nullifying the vote of the rest of the region. Illinois, to continue using that example, is 75% farmland (43,536.25 sq mi) yet is entirely politically controlled by those who reside within the 4,198 sq mi Chicago Metropolitan area. 9,533,040 people reside within that metropolitan area alone (74.48% of the state population) meaning it only takes 2/3rds of voters in that tiny area (less than 10% of the state) alone to give a party power over the entire state. This creates an obvious power imbalance where those living in rural areas end up feeling hopeless and resent those who have a population advantage but no perspective on their problems and issues. Conversely there are people (seemingly like yourself, since you believe Republican power in Congress is undeserved) on the opposite side of the issue who believe that they should hold all the power because they have more people who agree with them even if those people only represent a small portion (by area) of the state/country. This divide only continues to grow as the years go by and urban areas become even more populated without the opportunity to expand. The only way for these urban areas to expand are if development is forced upon private landowners via eminent domain (possible because the urban area controls the majority), which leaves a sour taste in the mouth of both the landowner who feels their property was stolen and the city dwellers who feel the landowners are hogging the space they need.

"As the Commander for the US Joint Forces Command, Mattis signed off on the  (2010). I believe this is a good representation of his views on the effects Climate Change may have upon the US Military: In terms of **Maritime Access to the Arctic**, it states: >Furthermore, shrinking sea ice opens new areas for natural resource exploitation, and may raise tensions between Arctic nations over the demarcation of exclusive economic zones and between Arctic nations and maritime states over the designation of important new waterways as international straits or internal waters. As an early move in this new competition, in 2007 two Russian submersibles made an unprecedented dive 2.5 miles to the arctic sea floor, where one ship dropped a titanium capsule containing a Russian flag. Retreating ice creating access to previously unavailable natural resources is but one example of potential security challenges that did not exist in the past. **Rising Sea Levels:** Some one-fifth of the world’s population as well as one-sixth of the land area of the world’s largest urban areas are located in coastal zones less than ten meters above sea level. Furthermore, populations in these coastal areas are growing faster than national averages. In places such as China and Bangladesh, this growth is twice that of the national average.23 Should global sea levels continue to rise at current rates, these areas will see more extensive flooding and increased saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers upon which coastal populations rely, compounding the impact of increasing shortages of fresh water.... >In this regard, tsunamis, typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural catastrophes have been and will continue to be a concern of Joint Force commanders. In particular, where natural disasters collide with growing urban sprawl, widespread human misery could be the final straw that breaks the back of a weak state. **Desertification:** >One should not minimize the prospect of wars over water. In 1967, Jordanian and Syrian efforts to dam the Jordan river was a contributing cause of the Six-Day War between Israel and its neighbors. Today Turkish dams on the upper Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, the source of water for the Mesopotamian basin pose similar problems for Syria and Iraq. Turkish diversion of water to irrigate mountain valleys in eastern Turkey already reduces water downstream. Even though localized, conflicts sparked by water scarcity easily could destabilize whole regions. The continuing crisis in Sudan’s Darfur region is an example of what could happen on a wider scale between now and the 2030s. Indeed, it is precisely along other potential conflict fault lines that potential crises involving water scarcity are most likely. ",t3_a862uy,NeutralPolitics

"The lowest reversed court is overturned 42% of the time, and the highest is reversed 87% of the time (6th circuit). The 11th circuit court is reversed 85% of the time, followed by the 9th circuit. If it wasn't abundantly clear, SCOTUS only hears about 80 cases per year, so they are not reversing 87% of the 6th circuits decisions. They are only reversing 87% of the cases they hear from that court. &#x200B; Of the 11 circuit courts, only 4 are reversed less than half the time, the other 7 are reversed more than half the time. That strongly indicates SCOTUS shies away from taking cases just to reaffirm the lower courts decisions. And it makes a certain amount of sense- if they agree with the decision, what's the point in hearing it again? Because they can be so selective on the cases they take, they try to take cases that are novel and/or that they can make a statement by issuing a ruling.

"While this question presents a very interesting ethical dilemma, the reality as simpler (and more brutal). My personal background first: I hold dual citizenship. My home country offers universal health care (private is available too) while my motherland does not (neither is UK nor USA). In both countries, any hospital has to follow the law. If the law forbids or enforces a particular practice or choice, everyone has to follow. Therefore, if the law forbids the continuation of life support and the release from the hospital of an unhealthy individual in critical condition, the hospital has to follow the law; regardless if it is a public or a private hospital. As a real example, my home country (that offers universal healthcare) allows the use of medical cannabis. Both private and public medical centers can prescribe it. In my motherland it is illegal and no hospital or doctor can offer or prescribe it (despite the fact that my motherland is one of the greatest producers of recreational drugs!). I do realize that Alfie Evans' case is much more tragic and complicated than those described above, however, the same principle applies. The rule of law governs the decisions made and whether universal healthcare is available or would not make any difference. ",t3_a7k90f,NeutralPolitics

"This is basically it, yeah. A simplified history: Countries like associating with other countries that they feel share their values. Historically, the compatibility of these values were largely determined by shared language and language and religion. Which made sense for the time, since shared language meant that it was easier to trade and shared religion would generally mean that they were beholden to the same religious authority. Also in general, shared language and religion were just generally pretty good indicators of commonality between many soceties. The first world war flipped the script on this a bit. Coalitions had formed which essentially ratified alliances between various countries, in part to solidify and preserve preexisting relationships between member states. After WW2 and with the rise of the NATO, lines in the sand were drawn by ideological differences. The two main competing ideologies were democracy and communism, exemplified by the U.S and Russia. Propaganda campaigns were run on both sides. The United States touted capitalism and the 'American Dream', while denouncing communism as a threat to modern society and the new world order. Russia's propaganda was posited in collectivism, a shared utopia that could only be achieved through hard work. They saw capitalism as predominantly individualist and a threat to their utopia. As the Cold War escalated, and the 'Red Scare' hit the West, tensions heated. In the United States, calling someone a 'dirty commie' or even a 'communist sympathizer' was equivalent to calling someone an enemy of the state.  and the law is still in place today, despite having been challenged on a state level, the federal supreme court hasn't had a ruling on it, and it has been largely unenforced. So words like 'Socialism' and 'Communism' are considered derision in the United States. Democrats in the United States have been largely 'center-right' since the rise of 'Third Way' politics post-Reagan and Thatcher. In recent years, the US's democrats have started to factionalize, with distinctions made between 'corporate democrats' (third way) and 'socialist democrats' or 'new democrats' (Bernie and Cortez). Some folk are essentially attempting to rebrand the word 'socialist' but are facing a backlash as they collide with the anti-communist rhetoric perfected during the Red Scare.

"The difference between you and I is that I want localized government so that minority groups have a louder voice where they are present. I never once said I was happy with the current system, as you seem to be convinced I am. You want mob rule so that you can suppress the concerns and interests of those minority groups you consider less important. I said I was happy with local control five comments back, and never argued against your more narrow scope of federalism (although again, federalism helps geographic minorities, not so much racial/ethnic/LGBT minorities, so it's picking winners and losers). I also didn't say I want 'mob rule' to 'suppress the concerns...of those minority groups I consider less important.' Although, you did give a example which purported to show mob rule *not* suppressing the concerns of minority groups...so either this isn't a real problem, or mob rule *does* suppress those groups and you don't care because you consider them less important. The current system helps those who would otherwise not have a voice. Those who claim do not have a voice actually have the voice of the majority. If the current majority had the power, they would be inclined to ignore the voice of a specific minority (rural populations) in favor of their preferred minorities. Honest question: how do you think the minority groups whose interests are represented within the Democratic Party got that power? It certainly isn't through being the majority, not even of Democrats. Why do you think it's completely impossible for rural groups to use the same strategies to gain a voice within national parties, without having extra power directly handed to them? If the Democrats and Republicans both had the support of a similar number of Americans overall, while each specifically looked out for the interests of particular minorities, their back-and-forth of power would protect everyone's rights. You're arguing against yourself. Either the system is helping give a minority group the voice it would otherwise lack, or it isn't. You've argued both that specific minorities don't have a voice in the system and that the system should be changed to no longer give a minority its voice. I'm talking about different minorities, I thought that was clear. The system is currently giving *some* minorities a special voice, but not others. I'm saying that it should either give special powers to all of them or none of them. I'm not arguing for the current system, I'm advocating for a different change that minimizes the effect any such system would have by placing the power as close to those affected by it as possible. This has been my consistent position from the start. So you're not arguing for the current system. Here's a hypothetical: would you be in favor of a system with significantly increased local control, but which eliminates the Senate entirely, making all national-level decisions in the House? This shouldn't impact your desire for increased local control at all. And if you're concerned about national-level decisions which still impact geographic minorities, that's why they have increased local control. Short of having no federal government at all, that local control is the only way to give those geographic minorities autonomy over their own destinies without *also* giving them authority over *other people's* destinies. (Well, there's also the 'requiring more than a bare majority to pass major changes' thing I mentioned earlier, and in this hypothetical scenario I'd certainly be willing to consider requiring major bills to pass the House by 60%, not just 50%. But that's implementation details.)",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"This is a poor set of examples because a) you've chosen unstable regimes, which poisons the well of discussion a bit, and b) you've chosen foreign regimes, which have different legal standards and separations of power than ours. Currently, the authority of the US president to fire the Fed Chairman is an unsettled question. He can fire governors (basically, the regional fed leaders below the chairman), for cause at least. But the chairman is in an ambiguous position.  So the question wasn't answered in practice, and it isn't answered in law. Whatever you think of Trump, though, this is a healthy discussion to have. The Fed is a fundamentally undemocratic role (intentionally so) with enormous power. If you lost money on the stock market yesterday, it's the Fed's fault, and there's nothing you can do about it. Your POTUS and your Congress didn't want it to happen. It'll be good to at least clear the air on the question of whether POTUS can actually do something about it or not (most economists likely hope he can't because it introduces a new avenue for instability in the market).

"It still sets a dangerous precedent for a number of reasons but let’s focus on 1. It’s very easy to shift that same standard to the police. Now you could claim this a slippery slope but I’m only shifting this to include the police which is a very small shift. The problem in this case then becomes a cop having to justify why didn’t do blank blank and blank. Now at 1st this might seem like a good thing but then think about all the people that outright despise cops and would do everything they could to get them in trouble. As it is a cop can’t act on every bad thing they see. Remember, on any given day cops see a lot of things that are technically crimes. A vindictive person or group can now use thar against them for not acting each and every time. That time a cop a let someone jay walking slide? Now that’s being used to punish them even if they didn’t actually see it be because now they have to prove they didn’t notice it. This also then runs into the problem of you’ve made these jobs much less attractive so you get worse people or you have to drastically up the pay. The smart thing to do is just to make sure you hire the right people. Sure it won’t be perfect but it’s a lot better then the alternative. The secret service is held to a higher standard, that’s why it’s so hard to get a job in it. It’s held to a higher standard by being very careful in who it hires. It comes back to the for that extra bit of security you give up some freedom thing. In this case though you might actually lose out on both. Side note, since you responded.

You can read the full decision , the judge ruled Obamacare unconstitutional but didn't actually stop the government from enforcing it, so it's still going now without the need for a stay or any other legal maneuver. The decision will also be immediately appealed and will take a little while to go through the courts (King v Burwell took over a year). Are other parts of the act such as forbidding the denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions no longer law? That's the other part of the judge's ruling. He said that the now-unconstitutional individual mandate was not severable from the rest of the bill and, as such, everything comes tumbling down. Pre-existing conditions are back, being eligible for your parents' plans in your 20s is gone, subsidies are gone, etc. etc. I have questions about this part of the decision, because it applies the legislative intent of 2010 onto the bill passed in 2017 (rather than using 2017's legislative intent, where they obviously believed that the mandate was severable because they severed it), but appeals courts will have to rule on that part as well.

">Many people believe gerrymandering creates political polarization. By skewing political representation so that Republicans and Democrats in each district are virtually guaranteed a win based on their party affiliation, they've created a situation where party representatives mostly need to win their party in the primaries, since they are virtually guaranteed a win in the general. Anyone who believes that doesn't understand how gerrymandering works. The idea with gerrymandering is, usually, to create as many districts as possible where you have 55-60% of the vote, while your opponents have as many districts as possible where they have 90%, that way you 'waste' your votes. to do that, though, requires eliminating your 90% districts, which is where extreme candidates come from, because if they get to extreme they'll lose a 55% district.

"The Corps of Engineers does design, engineering, program management, construction management, and quality assurance. They do this for any agency willing to pay their fee. What they do not typically do is the actual construction work. They contract that out to private companies. As others have stated the president has a “color of money” problem. Budget appropriations can only be used for their intended purpose. You can see in the NDAA line items like “$60M for a hospital on Naval Air Station Pensacola.” That money can only be used for that hospital on that base. If the Navy wanted to use that money to buy extra missiles they would have to go to congress which is a long and painful process. Back to the point, the Corps of Engineers was always, in my mind, the agency that would build the wall if it happened. They have far more experience managing and executing pubic works than DHS. When I hear that the military is building the wall it makes me think actual uniformed military personnel in the Army engineering battalions, Navy Seabees, or Air Force civil engineers. If that is the case, and I am not saying it is because details are nonexistent at this point, I have cause for concern. The Army specializes in battlefield obstructions to impede troop movement, not complex public works projects. I’ve seen and lived in Seabee built structures and feel pretty much the same way. So the funding would have to come from somewhere that requires congress to authorize it. If military personnel are going to be used i feel their efforts would be a lower quality than a contractor with a good past performance and we do have a war or two going on where they are probably needed a little bit more.",t3_a58jla,NeutralPolitics

Additionally, we don't need to have nuclear weapons to respond to a nuclear threat effectively. The government has undertaken *many* projects over the last century to address the threat of foreign powers' nuclear capability, and the response would almost definitely be a tactical deployment rather than simply blowing up the world in response to nuclear deployment against the US.

"As others have said, the information era, especially the advent of social media, has decreased interpersonal interaction while turning the remaining social circles into echo chambers. Another major factor has to be the increased wealth disparity we are seeing, as well as the outright corruption in our political system, everything from regulatory capture to the Russian collusion scandal. Take the NOAA for example. They are an underappreciated yet vital government organization. The NOAA is where every weather service gets its weather data. With no NOAA, we would have no weather forecasts, no tornado warnings, no hurricane warnings. Yet who did Trump put in charge of the NOAA?  who runs a company called Accuweather that **competes with the NOAA while using its data.** He is actively trying to make it so all weather info is behind a paywall - his paywall - and that the only way to get tornado warnings, etc. is to pay his company for it. These two factors tie into the third, which is general dissatisfaction with life. Lots of people are depressed, fewer people are finding success, it's harder to live now than it was a few decades ago by many people's reckoning. They see the government failing, big businesses screwing them over, their bank accounts are drying up. So they go for more and more radical politicians to shake things up.

I'm saying that it doesn't mesh with core concepts of democracy, including republics/representative democracies. The Senate *doesn't* have the same legislative power. But it can still make bills, vote on them, etc, which is an aspect I don't believe it should have so long as it's purpose is to give the minority a voice. As an advisory consent role in regards to judges/justices/cabinet members, as well as a second voice on amendments, it still fulfills it's original role, while also removing the possibility of Tyranny of the Minority. And to pre-empt any 'Tyranny of the Majority' comments, the only true version of that would be abolishing bill of rights and ignoring other rights that protect the minority.

"If the right wants to get real they will approve funding for more immigration judges. For example there is a 2 year backlog of cases in Los Angeles.  In Trumps fight against legal immigration he has argued asylum seekers don't show up. That's not true. The majority of Asylum seekers do show up to and are compliant with court orders and proceedings. Around 60+% of people follow through. That # could be higher though. One Obama-era program that released asylees from detention and matched them with case managers who encouraged compliance with court-ordered obligations. The program enrolled 560 families in 5 different regions. Before the Trump administration ended the program in June, participants had a 100 percent attendance record at court hearings. They also had a 99 percent rate of check-ins and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Trump is actively pushing legitimate lawful asylum seekers away from legal crossings by effectively blocking them at the border. Greatly reducing the amount of legal asylum seekers is what has cause the recent problems and strife at the border. Only allowing 40-100 people per day to seek asylum. Remember that US and international law protects a persons right to seek asylum. With thousands of people blocked at the border, penniless, with poor housing. Many tried to cross illegally out of desperation in the past week. This is what caused the tear gassings, and arrests.  Instead of funding reasonable programs to make that process smoother and encourage legal immigration and compliance. Trump would rather spend millions of dollars to protect against illegal crossing they are forcing people into. In a manner that many experts say won't work and will be exorbitantly expensive.

"You know things can develop and change, yes? 1979 is a full 4 years after the fall of Phnom Penh and 9 years after the North Vietnames forces invaded Cambodia on the behalf of the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge's genocide took place after they took the country. And while the Khmer Rouge was always wary of Vietnam, North Vietnam sheltered and armed Khmer Rouge forces during the insurgency they started in 1968, and provided enormous support - including invading Cambodia and handing the territory directly to the Khmer Rouge forces - until the early 1970's, after which relations soured as the Khmer Rouge became paranoid of Vietnamese influence, began purging Vietnamese elements from its ranks, and ultimately started border wars with Vietnam. You also make a point of saying Vietnam's invasion was designed to end Khmer Rouge attrocities, but the Vietnamese-Cambodian war (pointedly also named the Counter-offensive on the Southwestern border) was predominantly caused by Kampuchia launching a delusional invasion of Vietnam in 1977, failed peace talks run by China in 1978, and then a decision by Vietnamese leadership that Kampuchia was too pro-Chinese and anti-Vietnamese. It was far more geopolitical than moral, although I'll hardly complain about the intervention.

"That is quite simply untrue regarding the 2012 vote  First question was whether or not they wanted to continue Puerto Rico's current status. The majority of voters answered no, 54%. The second question, in this vote the one which was boycotted while the first was still voted on by opponents, was if the situation was changed what would they want. The options were statehood, independence, or free Association similar to the Marshal islands. Over 65% of respondents choose statehood, 5% said independence and 33% said free Association. while many opponents of a change didn't vote at all with 27% leaving the second question blank, that still leaves statehood as the plurality winner no matter which option they would have choose if they answered properly.

It's hard to source, because that's just pressure that prosecutors usually apply, but what Flynn pled guilty to is such an obvious case of overreach that it sounds very plausible that he did it under duress. Specifically, they charged him with concealing a conversion that everyone (including him) knew had been recorded (because it was official), that he corrected the record about himself the following day -- a correction they accepted and indicated that they found to be genuine -- and that they then nevertheless used against him anyway. I suppose it's possible that he pled to this weak charge in exchange for something unrelated to his son, but we haven't seen any hint of that yet.

"There were muzzle loaders that had multiple sets of locks to fire the rounds sequentially. So they were not semi automatic but repeating. There was also the Puckle gun which is more akin to a revolving cannon than a repeating rifle, but it was for military and commercial shipping as an Anti Piracy weapon. There was also the Giradoni Air Rifle that shot a 46 caliber ball at roughly 500fps. The hopper tube held 20 shots and could fire 30 shots at lethal velocities on par with black powder pistols. The rifle came with something akin to a bicycle pump to recharge the canisters. Lewis and Clarke carried one on their exploration since gunpowder was hard to come by on the frontier the 20 shot capacity constituted serious firepower. Perfect for an isolated expedition team that may face a numerically superior enemy. When the Bill of Rights was written the pinnacle of military technology were cannons, black powder muzzle loaders and Warships. All of those things were included in the 2nd amendment. The Revolutionary War saw the militia with black powder muzzle loaders and cannons go against a professional army with the same equipment. Up until the 1934 NFA you could buy anything that was in the Military Arsenal on the surplus market. After WW1 there were plenty of weapons to be had for cheap.

"I understand that we are supposed to limit comments to the stated goals of eliminating ISIS - goals that are also unequiviquably incomplete in both the literal sense and from the perspective of root cause (see: Hassan Hassan's work) - but if Trump cares at all about his other stated goals of dealing with Iranian influence, then this is also a dramatic retreat. Explanation of Iran's relation to American interests in Syria: 1.  I know it's a cop-out to just add some articles and call it a day, but the question posed by OP is...and I want to say this politely...myopic and inherently not useful. When we critique what Trump says at face value, we often fail to truly understand what's going on, fail to properly critique his progress, and, honestly, give undue credibility to what are often lies and spin. I believe this is a prime example of that. When we analyzed other presidents, we analyzed their policy goals, whether or not they were tweeted. Why not here? John Bolton, for example, has explicitly said: We’re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias. That's from September 24th of *this year*. It hasn't even been 3 months since America's explicit policy goal with the prevention of Iranian military influence in Syria, yet here we are confining the discussion to whether or not Trump met an entirely different goal. In short: we're discussing an obvious excuse, and even the excuse is poor - ISIS is *not yet* a victory. The prevailing thoughts are that Turkey and Rusisa have pursuaded the US to leave and that this is a defeat. As for the whole 'ISIS is defeated' thing, we also did that in 2008 under the surge and Anbar Awakening....so, obviously truly defeating ISIS is about more than just preventing them from holding territory. I'd like to add that there are (yet unconfirmed) reports of an ISIS counterattack in Hajin. While this is clearly too early for something like that to be effective, the point remains that once America stops supporting the YPG, they have an enormous amount of pressure to ration their resources more efficiently, even ceding territory if necessary. Turkey is claiming it will begin an offensive in the north very soon, and I would expect this will make it much more difficult for the YPG to run security in eastern towns. We may be seeing the background for a resurgeance of ISIS developing right now, although the scale will obviously be much smaller than before",t3_a7nvm3,NeutralPolitics

Russian intelligence and its helpers have a sophisticated doctrine, honed over decades, to wage what we would term Political Warfare against their enemies. To further the Kremlin’s aims, they cultivate Western politicos, activists and journalists to disseminate pro-Russian views on a wide range of issues; much of this is now conducted online. These Western partners range from being full-fledged agents of the Russian special services to mere pro-Putin influencers, not always entirely wittingly. Nevertheless, this Kremlin brand of espionage-based psychological operations — the proper term is Active Measures, which has no doctrinal NATO equivalent — can achieve devastating results through lies, half-truths, and forgeries. Russia takes advantage of Western gullibility, niceness, and unwillingness to accept just how dishonest the enemy is, sometimes to strategic effect.

">What arguments could be made for or against the actions that took place? There is nothing which defends the actions taken by Russian military in this matter. Because of the matters discussed in the UNLOS -  (see to this when articles are referred to later on) To begin with the detaining of Ukrainian ships... If you read the UNCLOS you will notice the articles 31, 32 and 33. Which describe in detail the rights on the coastal state towards 'offending' warships or other governmental ships under some other flag state in non-commercial service (to abbreviate the text a bit this is referred to as 'warship' further on). And the summary is: they can be ***told to leave***. That is all that can be legally done to them. They can not be legally detained, held, boarded, seized or anything such - Russian domestic laws are irrelevant in this. Furthermore it is important to realize that warships have immunity (see UNCLOS articles 95 96) - they are in essence part of the flag state. Even in case where the presence of the warship causes damage the warship is not the one held responsible but instead the state whose warship it is. That might be the summary if the violation only related to what UNCLOS refers to 'innocent passage' (UNCLOS part II, section 3) however the issue occurred while the Ukrainian ships were trying to pass through the Kerch straits it no longer is just about 'innocent passage' but instead 'transit passage' (UNCLOS part III) in which ships have even more extensive rights. Which changes things fair bit since they explicitly state that (UNCLOS article 42: Laws and regulations of States bordering straits relating to transit passage) >2. Such laws and regulations shall not discriminate in form or in fact among foreign ships or in their application have the practical effect of denying, hampering or impairing the right of transit passage as defined in this section. Which forbids Russia from preventing Ukrainian ships passing through the Kerch straits. Which leads us to the articles 44 and 45 of UNCLOS which relate to the transit passage through the straits: >Article 44: Duties of States bordering straits: States bordering straits shall not hamper transit passage and shall give appropriate publicity to any danger to navigation or overflight within or over the strait of which they have knowledge. ***There shall be no suspension of transit passage.*** >Article 45: Innocent passage: 1. The regime of innocent passage, in accordance with Part II, section 3, shall apply in straits used for international navigation: (a) excluded from the application of the regime of transit passage under article 38, paragraph 1; or (b) between a part of the high seas or an exclusive economic zone and the territorial sea of a foreign State. ***2. There shall be no suspension of innocent passage through such straits.*** That the waters may or may not have been Russian territorial waters is therefore irrelevant. It does not affect the right to 'transit passage' that the Ukrainian ships had nor can the local laws under any circumstance grant any rights to board or inspect foreign warships. It is worth noting that if the state owned ships would not be explicitly exempted from being 'pirate' (UNCLOS, article 101 and onwards) then the actions carried out by the Russian ships would qualify as such.",t3_a2cpp3,NeutralPolitics

"I'm fine with localized power. Federalism is a good idea, and states should have some ability to set laws and practices within their borders without interference from those outside their territory. The same should also go for individual cities and towns within states, for that matter (something that Republican-led states always seem perfectly happy to disregard). Stuff like minimum wage, for example, is probably best set at a more local level; likewise with certain types of taxation and fund allocation. However, the Senate is not an example of localized power. It necessarily performs acts which control the country at large. Same with the Presidency. I see no reason why a minority of people should have a disproportionate amount of control in deciding on national-level policies. You say you fear 'tyranny of the majority,' but when the alternative is 'tyranny of the minority,' I can't say I'm a fan. Also, the funny thing about 'tyranny of the majority' is that many of the rural states you describe have no problem with passing laws to take away rights from minorities within their own borders. In an attempt to avoid 'tyranny of the majority' by giving the small states more local control over individual liberties, you actually enable 'tyranny of the majority' within those small states. So perhaps federalism isn't the be-all end-all solution to 'tyranny of the majority.'",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

First, 1994 was a relative high point in conservative political thinking among Republicans. In fact, between 1994 and 2004 the average Republican moved substantially toward the center ideologically, as concern about the deficit, government waste and abuses of social safety net that characterized the “Contract with America” era faded in the first term of the Bush administration. >But since 2004, Republicans have veered sharply back to the right on all of these dimensions, and the GOP ideological shift over the past decade has matched, if not exceeded, the rate at which Democrats have become more liberal. >A second consideration is that the nation as a whole has moved slightly to the left over the past 20 years, mostly because of a broad societal shift toward acceptance of homosexuality and more positive views of immigrants. Twenty years ago, these two issues created significant cleavages within the Democratic Party, as many otherwise liberal Democrats expressed more conservative values in these realms.

"Source is fine, fact is that drug companies R&D costs trend somewhat lower than marketing. Here is why -- due to the relatively short exclusivity periods, drug companies have a VERY small window of time to establish a long-term brand before generics basically take away their reliable revenue streams. In that time, they have to get as many people to believe their product is the superior one (despite the same chemistry in the generics). By providing a reliable, longer period of exclusivity, we would actually reduce the need for advertising. No source on that, but I can probably find one later if this isn't determined to be fairly basic. I'm confused by your argumentation. The US has *longer* periods of exclusivity and is also the vast majority of where marketing dollars are spent. In, say, Europe, where there are shorter exclusivity periods there are also bans on advertisement of pharmaceuticals, meaning that the marketing budget there is much smaller. if I understand correctly you are saying that a less pharma-friendly regulatory structure means they have to make a big splash early through ad buys when in fact the example you supplied suggests exactly the opposite, that in the pharma-friendly USA drug companies are also spending big bucks to advertise. In fact the USA, Brazil, and New Zealand are  which they are doing (according to the article above) to the tune of $410 per person per year. Following your logic, why would pharma companies simply not push for a ban on DTC marketing in the USA and then save the hundreds of billions?

"Okay, so I don't think your tone was at all the issue. I've read very inflammatory posts with much worse tone than yours that were kept up on this subreddit. The issue is that you absolutely must back up your statements with some facts sourced from elsewhere. The mods will always delete statements with no sources, because they're trying to avoid the emotionally-charged zero-evidence debates of other subreddits. I cannot count the number of times I've tried to post something thoughtful with sources and evidence on other political subreddits and had some idiot reply with false statements or appeals to emotion. That really doesn't happen here, or at least happens FAR less. It's a pain and it takes some getting used to, but it absolutely makes the quality of the discussion better, and filters out the trolling, shilling, and cheerleading you see on other subreddits. Yes, it makes replying to other people harder, since you absolutely have to source your statements. But it also means that the people who reply to you will almost always have something intelligent to say and not just 'Trump is evil nazi!' or 'Trump is always right!' type of replies - both of which infuriate me. --- It also helps add to the credibility of your statements. If you want to say that Mattis did X and Y, you may be right, but we have no way to evaluate your statements if someone contradicts you and says that Trump did it and Mattis hated it. We're trying to avoid situations where it's one anonymous redditor's word vs another anonymous redditor's word.

"I think Federalist 62 and one other (74? sorry can't find it right now, or maybe Constitutional Convention notes?) are on point ... there are a few key factors they discuss on why making the Senate anti-Democratic is a good thing. Some aged well, some did not. First, was to avoid the day-to-day passions of the masses, so they gave Senators 6 year terms to insulate them from the passions of the day. I completely and totally agree with that. The next big idea was State appointment of Senators (vs. direct election other options were discussed too). The rationale there was to avoid partisanship, and that would yield better representation by having the Senators more responsive to the needs of the state. That turned out to just having them responsive to the party bosses from each party. Therefore the 17th Amendment changed that so Senators were directly elected by the People. Lastly, the particular version of The Senate Compromise that passed, where each state got 2 Senators, only barely passed, by a single last minute vote change. The idea was really that contentious back then. If the difference in the state populations had been much greater than the 9x it was at that time, its highly likely that the Senate Compromise probably would have been different. If in 1787 in Philadelphia, there was a 70x difference in population between states as there is today, its hard to believe they would have agreed to completely equal representation. One of the other options would have been agreed upon (perhaps as simple as giving the largest few states 3 senators).. One can even see a pretty easy argument the large states might make, if the difference was 70x, that the small ones weren't even populous enough to be states yet.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"Clinton was impeached for lying under oath, correct?  But it's worth noting that Clinton didn't lie because he was embarrassed. He lied because Paula Jones was suing him for sexual harassment, and trying to establish a pattern of behavior using the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton- after trying to use his authority to shut down the lawsuit- lied about the affair and instructed Monica and others (like Linda Tripp, his lawyer, and his secretary) to lie as well. He withheld evidence that was subpoenaed. It was a pretty clear-cut case of obstructing justice because he didn't want to face the consequences of committing sexual harassment.

"If the tariff conflicts cause long-term negative financial impacts, the Fed darn well better respond in some fashion, don't you think? Sure, but how do we know whether it's a long term or short term problem? Let's take a quick look at the , which reads as follows: 'The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.' So, three specific goals: keeping steady the rate of employment, prices of goods, and interest rates, all over the longer term. The House of Representatives, the President, and the Senate all have shorter time horizons - 2, 4, 6 years at a time - whereas the Federal Reserve is thinking about the health of the economy over decades to come. So, obviously, when stocks start sliding, elected officials are concerned. We need to reassure our voters that things are normal, we need the Fed to take action! But that might very well be a political problem, not necessarily a structural problem with the national economy. Stocks can go up and down for all kinds of reasons. And stocks aren't necessarily closely tied to jobs or prices of basic goods.

"I was talking primarily about 2017, not 2012. But sure, let's talk about 2012 if that's what you want. Over 65% of respondents choose statehood [...] Your number is wrong. The official result say about 61%, not 65%. But only 44% of the ballots that were cast on that day contained a vote for statehood. The '61%' is a number that was carefully crafted to be a lie. The truth of the matter is that opponents of statehood portray every vote as unfair and unclear, protesting even straight up and down 'do you want Puerto Rico to become a us state' non binding referendums. The truth of the matter is that the referendums since 1998 have been rigged in favor of statehood. They're not legitimate democratic exercises. Legitimate democratic elections follow processes that allow all parties in the polity to participate. For example: 1. The government doesn't unilaterally decide what candidates or options appear on the ballots. Any eligible candidate that meets pre-stated criteria must be put in the ballot, and even then there's write-in option. 2. For votes to enact or reject a proposition, there is a clear 'no' option to unambiguously reject all proposals. There is a process for public initiative so that propositions can be put in the ballot even if the government doesn't agree with them. The Puerto Rican referendums since 1998 involve a systematic pattern of violating that sort of democratic principles. Imagine if your state held a vote on banning 'infanticide' where the following two options were put to vote: * It shall be a capital crime to kill any child unborn or born. * Children unborn, or born but less than 1 year old, may be killed without penalty. Such a hypothetical referendum is obviously defective and undemocratic, because there is no option offered to just say 'no' or 'none of the above.' Puerto Rico's referendums for the past 20 years have had some version or another of this fundamental defect. That's why opponents have repeatedly boycotted them—because the statehooders have rigged them so that their other options would be to, figuratively, vote for infanticide. And that's the defect with all the people in this thread who say the boycotters should vote 'no.' The only time there was a 'no' option was in 1998, and they voted for that—so much that 'None of the Above' got a simple majority. But getting 'None of the Above' into the 1998 ballot required the intervention of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, and between 2004 and 2012 the statehooders, in a Garland/Gorsuch type of move, stole like four seats on that court and the partisan judges overturned the precedent that protected Puerto Ricans from the rigged pro-statehood referendums. If such an election had been held in Venezuela or Crimea, Americans would call it rigged. But when it's held on their colony that they rule tyrannically and want to dispossess its people from their ancestral homeland, evidently a good lot of you are cool with it.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

Further, how is extending protection against generics beneficial to US healthcare consumers? Wouldn’t such an onerous protection go directly to the pharmaceutical’s profit margin? They have no incentive in this to reduce price. Straight forward logic indicates that this protection, _a direct antithesis to free market principles_, will be a net cost increase across the board for consumers only fattening the pharmaceuticals.

"If I can add another suggestion - we don’t need source citations for *immaterial* facts or *commonly accepted* facts. The fact that obiter dicta is non-binding is a commonly accepted fact by the legal profession. It’s like if someone had to provide a source for asserting the fact that it rained in San Francisco last week - like, sure, it’s a fact and a source could be provided, but what’s the point? Is neutral discussion really being achieved by requiring someone to support that assertion of fact? I’m a lawyer myself, and I frequently find the Draconian interpretation of the “facts need to be sourced” rule to completely neuter any desire I have to engage in discussion on legal topics. I don’t want to have to source easily verifiable, undisputed facts like dicta being non-binding. Like, would I really need to provide a source to say “The First Amendment prevents the government from interfering with freedom of speech”? What’s the point of that? My suggestion is the sub works to be more like r/AskHistorians, where certain users who have provided the mods with credible evidence supporting a specific expertise gain an “expert” flair, and would be generally exempt from these sorts of sourcing requirements. Of course, if a poster is talking about a topic outside their subject matter expertise, the rules would apply normally, but there’s definitely an issue with over-adherence to enforcing the black letter of the rules here. Having a source for a statement like “dicta is non-binding” is nothing but window dressing. It’s the equivalent of a mobster thinking payment of $1 to a lawyer is sufficient to create an attorney-client privilege that’s impenetrable by the courts. If a fact that’s asserted doesn’t form a key premise of the logical conclusion that’s drawn from those premises, or if a fact is asserted that is indisputably accepted by experts in a field, then the failure of a poster to provide a source for those assertions of fact should not result in deletion of the post. It doesn’t just hinder discussion in a thread, it quells the desire of posters like me who have attained a specific expertise but are either too busy or too apathetic to have to source every single assertion of immaterial or commonly accepted fact we make. A physicist shouldn’t have to source the fact that Einstein discovered relativity, a doctor shouldn’t have to source the fact that Pasteur developed penicillin, and a lawyer shouldn’t have to source the fact that dicta is non-binding. Those sorts of things don’t foster *neutral* discussion, they just make it harder to have *any* discussion. That’s not to say you or any of the mods are doing a bad job, or to cast dispersions on the culture that’s been cultivated here. I’m just saying I think there’s a way to have our cake and eat it too, and the current enforcement scheme is a less than ideal approach. Edit: And to be clear, I think AutoMod is the biggest source of issues here. I know the sub couldn’t function the way it does without it, but that bot’s sliders are set wayyyy too aggressively. I think the mods typically do a good job, and while I understand the reasoning why you asked for a source definition, I still think it doesn’t really serve the purposes of fostering neutral discussion - it’s just an extremely high barrier to participation.",t3_a77mum,NeutralPolitics

Without proper management expertise, even large unexpected windfalls can cause financial catastrophe:  The financially savvy tend to spend their money on appreciating assets, education, debt reduction, and other strategies that enhance their ability to make money in the future, reduce expenses and risk, or exploit future opportunities. Their confidence and faith in the future encourages them to invest in themselves, and personal growth. People that are less financially savvy tend spend their windfall money on depreciating assets, status symbols, and impressing acquaintances, friends and family.

The platform of the current political majority (Democrats) largely revolves around sexual and racial minorities. It's literally one of the leading bullet points (as well as the one with the most specific topics dedicated to it) on the official party platform:  Are you claiming that they are underrepresented? Because the reality is the majority of registered voters are pushing for these agenda items. Only 4.5% of the population is a member of the LGBT community and yet one party includes their issues as an entire portion of their platform with the other party also holding widespread support for LGBT issues (in a 2018 poll it was found that 67% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, for example). Racial minorities, which make up 23.4% of the population, enjoy these same benefits of the majority supporting them. The primary differences here are the methods each party believes to be most beneficial for minorities, with Democrats favoring programs like affirmative action (which, ironically, is a form of institutionalized racism - something they claim to oppose in their party platform) while Republicans favor solutions such as increasing the number of available jobs within the US as a whole. This doesn't target minorities specifically, though it does disproportionately affect minorities since their unemployment rate is traditionally much higher (White: 3.3%, African American: 6.2%, Hispanic/Latino: 4.4%, Asians are the only lower one with a 3.3% unemployment rate - all data is from ",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

If an issue is not governed by the US Federal government, Puerto Rico has jurisdiction over it within its borders.

Therefore, if they're going to be governed more and more by the US Federal government they should have a vote in how they are ultimately governed.

I agree that we impact each other. That could apply to foreign countries as well since the UN passes resolutions and sends inspectors and troops into other countries. We could have a law that contributions can only go to the jurisdiction of the registered voter. That could include PACS only getting and giving money in their jurisdiction. A common scam in state elections is for donors to contribute the politicians in their state party and then the money gets funneled to the races that are most critical. Keeping money local would stop that as well.,t3_aarvjr,NeutralPolitics

"You know, I don't actually have any major problems with the system as you described it. I'm a little concerned about the lack of a national 'social safety net,' but on the other hand it's something of a Democratic talking point to say 'why do the red states get more money from the national safety net than they pay in, proportionally?', so I can hardly object to a system that requires the safety net to be funded locally. Maybe local funding could even help change attitudes towards it, so it's not 'I'm paying taxes so those people *over there* have a safety net,' but 'I'm paying taxes so people *in my state* have a safety net.' This does depend on people feeling a sense of camaraderie with fellow citizens of the same state, but that's kind of assumed for any increase-local-control system. Actually, now that I'm writing about it, there is one moderate problem with making things extremely local: corporations which have the choice of where to set up headquarters and other facilities can much more easily (and thoroughly) play states against one another to get extreme deals and tax breaks. A lot of people weren't happy about the bargaining Amazon did with Virginia and New York, but increased local control would make 'a few billion in tax breaks' look like nothing. Stuff like 'we'll move our factory to your state if you reduce regulations on working conditions' could become commonplace, for example. I don't have a good solution for this offhand, honestly; I just have a lingering feeling that increased local control could lead to a cyberpunk corporate-extraterritoriality nightmare if taken far enough.",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"I think your explanation is brilliant. I just want to explore one point from the conclusion: Even if they are able to vote for the Bernie Sanders type candidate in the general election (e.g. Jill Stein) they may not do so because they may feel it is hopeless. Perhaps Brazil's electoral system is more, 'open' in terms of the chance of third parties winning...in the US it is basically nill because the people do not choose the President, the electoral college does, which is dependent upon the parties that are voted in. To the best of my knowledge the  system. E.g. if the district is 51% pink candidate and only a single representative can be selected, it is impossible for the 30% of the voters who support violet and 19% of the voters who support taupe to be represented.

"Yeah, you'll need to include an /s if your comment doesn't seem very sarcastic at all. What exactly were you trying to mock? People move in and out of the wealthiest group fairly regularly. You have a source for that? Downward mobility is usually vastly lower than upwards, and even so, I doubt the ultra-rich go from ultra rich to poor or even upper middle class, just potentially lower upper class. I hardly see that as a problem if the taxes levied are put to good use. It is not an issue like a lot of redistributionists like to claim it is. Inequality *is* a problem. It's been show to be correlated with worse health ( and crime ( However, simply redistributing the wealth won't necessarily solve that issue. The wealthiest group also has a track record of either massive job creation or massive innovation under them. Sure, but this tax wouldn't remove the wealthy class, only make sure that they can't just maintain it idly over generations. Innovation only improves at high levels of inequality because *companies* with accumulated market share can exploit economies of scale. Reducing the inheritance of individuals doesn't necessarily prevent that. In fact, it could also be the case that by reducing inheritance, that the children of the ultra-rich have to innovate more to re-achieve the wealth that was taxed from them. It's also been shown that higher lobbying intensity reduces innovation:  'Next, we show that the positive effects of innovation on the top 1% income share are dampened in states with higher lobbying intensity.' And indeed, market rents 'are needed to incentivize innovation and compensate for its costs, but beyond a certain level they become detrimental.'  So again, reducing wealth accumulation by the ultra-rich may indeed have a positive effect simply by reducing their political power.",t3_a4ofkq,NeutralPolitics

" “While the president appoints the Fed's board of governors, including the chairman, the central bank 'derives its authority from the Congress, which created the System in 1913 with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act,' according to the Fed's website. 'The Board reports to and is directly accountable to the Congress but, unlike many other public agencies, it is not funded by congressional appropriations,' the site says 'The President can nominate a chair but once the chair is confirmed, the president is out of it and the only way you can remove a chair from office is literally if they broke the law. Congress will have to find a cause to remove them from office through a vote and a procedure,' Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist, told CNBC in October. But Trump has already broken with precedent through his repeated criticism in the second half of this year of the Fed and the chairman to the press and via Twitter, including this week before the central bank hiked rates. Other presidents privately tried to influence the Fed, but none did so in such a public and forceful matter.”",t3_a8mtoc,NeutralPolitics

">I support border security, but if I got to pick, a good fence, plenty of patrols, and quality reconnaissance is the best bet. Not really. Border security is incredibly simple. Congress just needs to pass legislation mandating e-verify, with stiff penalties for employers failing to comply. Offer citizenship to any undocumented immigrant that turns in an employer that's hiring under the table. They don't even need to deport anyone, they can get rid of ice almost entirely. Without the ability to get a job, most undocumented workers would probably leave in a few months.

Yes, the top two quintiles are covering a much larger percentage of income taxes in the US since the 80's, but we also know that's not because of increased taxes on the top 40% of earners.  It's not that we're spending more on consumer goods, but that the percentage of our GDP that's based on industrial and other non-consumer goods has shrunk. We're now more of a service economy than an industrial economy. All that said, I think you're right that nominal tax relief on the lower and middle-income quintiles isn't going to do much to really positively impact wealth for those quintiles.

But the POTUS has the power to restrict access to the border and require everyone who enters to come through a checkpoint through normal means, but cannot turn away a citizen or person with a valid visa through normal means. Based on the title and original post that I saw, I assumed the question was simply regarding Trumps capabilities to unilaterally strengthen restrictions on the border. Of course the powers of the President are expanded in times of national security crises, and he would be able to (in theory) completely shut down the border with adequate justification (i.e. Evidence a WMD/(bio)chemical weapons crossing the border for a terror plot, or evidence of a planned ground invasion) but the circumstances would need to be much more extreme than just 1000s of illegal crossings and a few isolated acts of violence as a result",t3_aac5kd,NeutralPolitics
"There are many things a centralized government can do: this does not mean that a centralized government should do them or that they can do them more effectively than a more localized system of governance. The anti-Democratic nature of the Senate is only a problem if you believe that the government should be run as a purely Democratic, mob-rule entity from the top down without taking into account the interests and concerns of the minority (which includes not just people favored by the right like rural populations, but also groups more popular with the left such as the LGBT community and racial minorities). You and I disagree on this point, and that's a fundamental difference that would make it difficult for us to come to an agreement. I wish to have the power of the Senate be irrelevant enough in day to day life that the lack of a perfect system to distribute its power doesn't matter to citizens. You wish for a more perfect system, though you and I also disagree as to what a perfect system would entail (I believe, similar to the founding father, that direct Democracy can easily lead to tyranny of the majority). From my perspective solving the issue I have with the Senate is more immediately beneficial, since it minimizes the impact of the issues you have with the Senate leading to a win-win scenario for both of us (even though I would be more satisfied in the short term, the effects of your grievance are at least minimized).

It might seem that way on a first glance but it really is not. The reason (as described in the post you referred to) is that warship as such is largely considered to be an extension of the flag state. Which also has national sovereignty rights. Therefore the coastal state can not board a foreign warship without violating the sovereignty of the flag state. That is the conundrum as per definition national sovereignty can not trump national sovereignty as the states are equal - and therefore it is exactly because of the national sovereignty that the proper solution is to ***'tell it to leave'***.

Obviously, he was not a fan of North Vietnam; he was actively fighting the combined North Vietnamese and Khmer forces that were threatening his rightist government. You then ignore this: North Vietnam sheltered and armed Khmer Rouge forces during the insurgency they started in 1968, and provided enormous support - including invading Cambodia and handing the territory directly to the Khmer Rouge forces ...which clearly proves that this claim: The Khmer Rouge and communist in Vietnam were enemies ...is not true for the full history of the Khmer Rouge. And then you claim this: It was also Vietnam that invaded Cambodia in 1979 over the Khmer Rouge’s murderous behaviour. Which is not true. I wrote about that and you ignored it...so, whatever. Great conversation. And somehow you don't realize that I never stated that America wasn't supporting Lon Nol *after* North Vietnam began its invasion on behalf of the Khmer Rouge, and so you continued to hammer on that point as if it were contested.

"I think it's probably reasonable to suppose that efforts to distill the corpus of legal values into a single pinnacle is simply not possible, given the richness of the US legal tradition, which combines both the founding principles and the history of British common law which precedes the founding. Additionally, it is exceptionally difficult to sort (in a hierarchical sense) the quintessential founding values because, as more modern political and philosophical thinkers have pointed out, American *has never held its extolled virtues as controlling legal principles.* Consider this remark by MLK Jr. - which was radical for its time but which seems obviously correct in retrospect: We are not wrong, we are not wrong in what we are doing. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong... If we are wrong, justice is a lie. (my edit - I just cut out a religious portion which, while eloquent, is not germane to the examination of the highest legal value in the US tradition). Noam Chomsky has also done a fairly good job throughout his career of cataloging the gap between announced virtues of American law and the reality of the American justice system. Since Chomsky's primary school of study is linguistics, his research and writings might be particularly meaningful to you in understanding how to sort the catalog of words used to describe legal values. I'll also point out that, more recently, Michelle Alexander has added to this discussion wonderfully and that her writings are absolutely worth digging into; she might even be one of the top thinkers writing today in an attempt to answer your question. Now that I've given five paragraphs of disclaimer about how enormous a task it is to arrive at a succinct answer to your question, I'll offer what I think is probably the most obvious single value driving the philosophy of the American legal tradition: liberty. In American legal terms, liberty means essentially that the people are free to do as the please, and that the government can't do anything to stop people from making their own decisions and living their own lives unless that thing is specifically authorized by an enumerated, promulgated power, listed in the Constitution. Now again, this idea stands in incredible and disgusting contrast to the fact that, not only did the USA formally allow slavery prior to the 13th amendment, but it actively encouraged slavery and supported slave owners with laws like the Fugitive Slave Act. Additionally, of course, we still have slavery today in the form of a justice and prison system that stands in absolute contrast to the extolled value of liberty (recall that the 13th amendment affords for slavery . So, in short, liberty is the highest legal value in the USA, but the legal values of the USA are actually meaningless when the government wants to do something different. Understanding this leads, I think, naturally to the conclusion that the US government has, at this point, outlived its usefulness and that the Constitutional history of the United States is best understood as a good and meaningful effort, but one that needs to be heavily revised and tried again anew.",t3_a77mum,NeutralPolitics
">And that's because you've chosen to see the decision as a good faith attempt at improving checks and balances instead of it being a consolidation of power to a political ideology for political gains after an election which has objective representation issues. Constuting a Crisis that is out of favor with the governed (democracy). I choose to see it as a ridiculously partisan move that actually benefits democracy in what is likely an unintended side effect. Removing unilateral power from the governor's office is a good thing. Just because one side can't abuse executive power like previous governors have doesn't make the removal of that power any less beneficial to the people. Fix your gerrymandering issue and that solves the rest of this problem. Continuing in a broken system because you don't like that it benefits one side more in the short term is incredibly short sighted and shows a lack of interest in taking any kind of action to improve the system. Yes, this is a politically motivated action, but it also serves to benefit democracy. Take a step back from the partisan politics of the two major parties, view the system as a whole and tell me removing the governor's ability to unilaterally veto portions of a carefully worded bill passed by an elected legislature does not improve the overall democratic process.",t3_a3h7i4,NeutralPolitics

"It was a different poster than the one I replied to originally. They stated that (1) there is no way that a veto can be invalidated and (2) it's irrelevant because China should also veto a measure censuring Russia in any way for their invasion of Ukraine. I agree with the second point, but the UN rules for voting state that: >a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting. Since there is no actual veto process after a vote is cast (veto simply refers to the provision where all five permanent UNSC members must concur to a vote), Russia would be forced ('shall abstain') to abstain from a vote on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, except that they argue that they are not in the conflict right now. So the US or someone else would have to get them properly classified by the UN through a process I don't know of, then Russia could be censured for their actions in Ukraine. Even still, I agree that China would probably protect them. There's nothing in the veto power rules that prevents the abstention in the case of you being a party to a conflict as far as I know. It's just a lot of political capital to use for very little gain, unless the US or Germany or someone wants to start helping Ukraine with the war more committally. The other option which we did not discuss was using a 'uniting for peace' measure to accomplish censure of Russia. This could be a way around Russia and China, but stil may not be effective.

"I agree that the terms can have poor definitions. I'd add that they also have un-necessary stigma as they get used negatively as insults. There's a lot of social manipulation, so much so that the terms are almost useless unless a given discussion sets out clear definitions when it begins(or within a like-minded group). In the case of liberal and conservative used correctly these terms wouldn't be on the same spectrum. Instead it would be progressive (valuing progress) vs conservative (valuing what we have now) and liberal (valuing of individual freedom) vs authoritative (valuing the elite to override individuals). I wouldn't agree. Conservatives can also be liberal. [EG US is fairly liberal and conservatives want to keep it that way rather than yield to progressive reduction in individual rights ] 'Leftists' can be authoritarian, but self identify as 'liberal' and most people wouldn't argue against them. *Authoritarian VS Anti-authoritarian* would be one legitimate spectrum. That's often charted against conservative VS liberal(so often used as a stand-in for progressive), where in conservatives are reserved and rely on tradition, and liberals lean to breaking many conventions. I'd venture to say a more apt chart pitting A-VS-AA against Collectivist VS Individualist, which is somewhat parallel to Left/Right as far as modern stances go. Again though, this all suffers the problem I originally addressed, it's always subjective. It's insanely difficult to find a decent political chart because they are so often infected with bias, especially as grievance studies believers diversify into the sciences(to include political science), re-defining or appropriating terms for their own ideology, adding their own spin, playing a PR game with terms that were once established as technical language has resulted in a net loss for specificity and understood meaning.",t3_a92z8p,NeutralPolitics

As with any plea agreement that includes people who are still under investigation, the people she interacted with in the US and in Russia are not specifically named. They are referred to by various phrases, like 'US Person 1', 'Russian Official', etc. The statement of offense implicates the referenced 'US Person 1' in numerous activities that were to assist and support Butina. There is a lot of reporting that US Person 1 is Paul Erickson, a GOP operative. Here's one example of that reporting:  The statement of offense also indicates that Butina coordinated her activities with a 'US Gun Rights Organization'. Publicly available information that ties the activities described in the Butina plea agreement to activities of the NRA are widely available. Here is one example:  The Butina plea agreement says that she 'opined that the circumstances were favorable for building relations with a certain US political party', and that party is referred to as 'Political Party #1' in the statement of offense. She is described as having met with officials of Political Party #1 in numerous venues, many of which can be corroborated as Republican Party officials from publicly available information. Here is one example:  So, your question was: Does this filing indicate new information on possible legal wrongdoing on the part of specific political figures or political organizations? Because the filing itself does not name the people or organizations specifically (due to privacy and investigative concerns), the direct answer to your question is 'no'.

"Of course not. They want more power. That doesn't mean there is any basis for giving it to them. They want to be represented by the people who they vote for, not people they don't vote for. How is that difficult to understand Put it to a vote and see how people will decide. You can't argue in one breath that the people don't have representation and then dismiss an option that would give them that representation. DC has voted, repeatedly, and the answer is always statehood. Why do the votes of people in the Dakotas matter, but the votes of people in DC don't matter? Hey, annexing DC back into the UK would *also* give them representation. Why shouldn't that be on the table, if the only thing that matters is giving the people of DC representation, no matter what they actually want? What? Are you referring to when North Dakota became a state? This is one of the sillier things I have seen on the sub, so feel free to explain the logic behind this. Yes, it *is* pretty absurd to change state boundaries to where they were in the 1800s. All of the states I mentioned were united in territories before they were admitted as states in their current form So why are you saying that we should ignore what people in DC want, and change Maryland's state boundaries to what they were in the *1700s*? Texas and Hawaii were foreign countries more recently than DC was part of Maryland. The Louisiana Purchase was still a french colony, and Florida was spanish. California was a province of Mexico. All of these things happened more recently than DC being a part of maryland I agree that we shouldn't merge the Dakotas for political expediency, but what is different about people in DC that they don't get the same consideration?",t3_a3elid,NeutralPolitics

"I don't really disagree with what you said, but I'm not sure that it strictly speaking contradicts what I said. Congress has delegated a lot of its power to the president. Taking away power they delegated to him is not a violation of the 'separation of powers'. If they wrote the legislation that allowed the President to appoint the Fed chairman (as the Fed isn't a Constitutionally empowered branch, but a Congressionally empowered one), I don't see how it would be a problem if they decided the Fed chairman would be an elected position or that it just went to the tallest person. Put another way, there is legislation that allows Senators to have staff. Since the President is in charge of enforcing the law, and the law says they can have staff, does that give him hiring/firing power over the Democratic leadership's staff? Absolutely not! I think it makes just as little sense to say the President inherently has hiring/firing power over this position. The power to fire for cause is a granted, delegated power.

Even if Trump deploys the military to the border and has them entrench a simple rampart he still has to take land to do that. That means paying fair price for it (though he can compel the sale) and that's going to need congress to fund it.

"The mortgage interest rates have gone down down down, ever since Carter left the POTUS office, after they severely spiked under him.  Homeownership in the US in 1970 was at 62.90%.  ''Black households have had lower homeownership rates than the general populace since 1950. However, rates for these households had a major increase from 35 percent in 1950 to 44 percent in 1980. From 1980 to 1990, however, there was a 1-percent decline. Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina posted the highest black homeownership rates in 1990, at or near 60 percent. Forty years earlier, Iowa and Kansas had black owner-occupancy rates at or above 60 percent. Yet, in 1990, the homeownership rates for black households in this pair of States had shrunk drastically (39 percent for Iowa and 43 percent for Kansas). In 1990, there were seven States where over half the black households lived in a home they owned; six of these were in the South -- the one exception was Pennsylvania. Hispanic households have had constant or slightly declining owner-occupancy rates since 1970. Like black households, Hispanics have had lower homeownership rates than the general populace. It is interesting to note one exception -- New Mexico where Hispanic owner-occupancy rates have matched or exceeded that of all households from 1970 to 1990. Extremely low homeownership rates for Hispanic households have been the rule in New York (14 percent in 1970, 15 percent in 1980, and 17 percent in 1990). ''  Maybe ''rent'' is higher in proportion now? It was easier to buy a house back then to live in, but not to rent out at high rates to exploit people.

"OK, great. Let's go through it... The necessary adjustments are mostly related to Rule D. Some of the main premises are not supported by the sources. For example, you've tied populism to nationalism, then equated that with something called 'populist nationalism,' and then asserted that adherents to that school of thought are against globalism, all without providing sources. At the very least, please link to definitions of these terms, but ideally, you want to provide sources that demonstrate these groups are connected in the way you've laid out. There's also the problem that  doesn't allow generalized attribution: 'Don't attribute a statement to a general group. Name a person who said the thing.' So, if the post is going to be about these groups, link to statements from official representatives of said groups. Other assertions of fact also need sources, such as: ...advocates of these movements are vocal in their advocacy for populist movements that occur outside of the borders of their own countries. and ...nations on Earth are innately at odds due to competition for scarce resources and fluctuating demand Then there's this: what are some reasons why (for example) a populist-nationalist voter in the United States who supports Donald Trump, would favor the election of a populist nationalist leader such as Marine Le Pen in France? This subreddit does not allow submissions that are requests to explain public opinion. Could you please just clarify the wording to ask how the *policies* of one party support those of another, not why people make certain decisions. We just want to make sure we're asking questions that can be answered with facts (Rules A G). Finally, the post puts forth the views of one person, Steve Bannon, as an example to support all the cases outlined in the opening premises, but there's no evidence that's an accurate to represent all those groups. If the post is about the policies of specific groups, please link to those policies as stated by those groups. If the post is about Steve Bannon, leave the links to his statements, but don't conflate the two. Does that all make sense? Just reply here if you have any questions. Thanks!",t3_a2ury2,NeutralPolitics

"I would like to challenge the premise of this discussion on two points. 1. By acknowledging that there might even be a legitimate question here we shift the obvious bad faith arguments being made into a zone of legitimacy. Should we also listen to a thief in our home who challenges the notion that private property is immoral? Shifting the Overton Window gives these arguments a respect they don't deserve. 2. The premise of OP's question is missing a key part of the bigger picture. The suite in question isn't the bribe, it's a kissing of the ring. A $50 million penthouse is chump change to one of the richest men in the world (. The real and obvious prize is the sanctions on Russia and the damage they continue to do to Putin's pocketbook and his power.",t3_a1uwqs,NeutralPolitics

"This leads me to ask the question, under universal health care such as the systems we see in nations such as the UK or Canada, does the individual surrender their personal agency to the will of the government? This leading question is patently untrue. Alfie didn't have any personal agency left, he was in a semi-vegetative state as the BBC article you yourself linked says. As  says: In some cases, if you are unconscious or have very little consciousness, a doctor can stop some life support treatment if there is no chance of you getting better, or if it's not in your best interests. However, only a court can give a permission for this to happen. This is not specific to the UK or Canada and not new either. Here's an article from 2001  hospitals in California and throughout the country have begun to implement these 'futile-care' policies The patient wants life- sustaining treatment; the physician does not believe the quality of the patient's life justifies the costs to the health institution or the physical and emotional burdens of care; therefore, the doctor is entitled to refuse further treatment (other than comfort care) as 'futile' or 'inappropriate.' The UK law, as mentioned above, mandates such decisions to be court approved but that's all.",t3_a7k90f,NeutralPolitics

While it does state Not even Mueller would be foolish enough to bring a case under the Logan Act, especially since Flynn did not interfere in a diplomatic dispute under the meaning of the act.
