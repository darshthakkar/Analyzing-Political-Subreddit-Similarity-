"I could understand if the Bolsheviks gave independence to Central Asia, even the Caucuses to an extent, and perhaps they could have for the eastern portion of the country, although I'm not sure of its ethnic and cultural makeup. Independence for other Slavs who were not meaningfully culturally or ethnically or linguistically distinct was a weird decision. Perhaps it was helpful in their conditions for building unity with other Slavs, to promote anti-Russian chauvinism, but as far as a response to the national question, this does not suffice as a theoretical contribution. And on the note of the Caucuses and Central Asia, the arbitrary division along ethnic lines not only had little logic, but has had deeply problematic consequences today. The 'Stan's' should have been one country. The Caucuses should have been one country, including the regions in Russia that were given autonomous status. Those parts of Russia were given autonomous status instead of independence because as a policy, they had a rule for how much sea and land you bordered to be independent vs autonomous. I think if you were landlocked within the USSR you couldn't be independent, but if you touched the outer border you could. But if the whole Caucuses had been a country, there wouldn't have been that problem, and there perhaps would not be the border disputes we've seen there over the last three decades. Armenia and Azerbaijan really aren't pleased with each other, both laying claim to one part of land, when they really should be part of the same country anyway. There was also that skirmish between Georgia and Russia back in I think 2007 (?). Anyway. I am in complete agreement. There are social relations outside of ideas. So does that mean that you agree that unity can't be built just through debate and discussion and consensus voting, but requires more fundamentally new approach to how we build unity? We can't build unity just by discussing, unless we privilege the opinions of women over those of men, for example, which isn't a bad idea in its own right. But there are some core things that can't be sacrificed for the sake of unity. Women's rights should be pursued as a very central tenet of the revolution. This is a material way to build unity, rather than an idealist way to build unity (as it prioritizes the material conditions of women over ideas). I basically see Soviet history like this. It may not be incorrect, but I see this as kinda defeatist. Perhaps my bias is to reject it solely on the basis that it's political implications are not conducive towards good social practice. I think that's why I pay so much attention to the roots of Soviet socialism, because I want there to be a reason Soviet socialism was unsustainable, so that hopefully we can improve our own practice for the future.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"Put simply, to quote 'Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism: Manual': 'And the theologians and clerics support them : >“Mastery of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism requires serious and thoughtful study and, consequently, much work and time. What are the fruits of such a study? >Put briefly, the answer is that it gives us an integral world outlook, the most progressive outlook of our time, one in which the cardinal components of the great teaching of Marx and Lenin are blended in a harmonious, integral system. >There are various kinds of world outlook, whether progressive or reactionary. Some of the latter are based on ancient beliefs and superstitions and seek to persuade religious-minded people that they must remain blindly dependent upon some supernatural being and his vicars and anointed regents on earth. Other philosophies, while not openly asserting the existence of a deity and even avowing faith in “science” resort to subtle but false arguments in an effort to destroy man’s conviction of the real existence of the material world. >That is the method used by the exponents of the most fashionable trends in modern idealism. Many of them do not themselves believe in the existence of supernatural forces but, influenced by the traditional conventions and prejudices of bourgeois society, are unwilling to close all doors against belief in the supernatural. New discoveries in science, they say, cast doubt on the materiality of nature. And the theologians and clerics support them, on the assumption that people who can be induced to believe in the non-materiality of nature are capable of believing anything. >Not everything that imitates science is real science, just as not everything that glitters is gold. And particularly in our time many varieties of idealist philosophy eagerly assume a scientific guise in order to conceal their anti-scientific substance. In reality, they fear the weighty evidence of scientific facts and seek to hush up or distort these fact. >Marxism-Leninism has great merits that distinguish it from all other philosophical systems. >It does not recognize the existence of any supernatural forces or creators. It rests squarely on reality, on the real world in which we live. It liberates mankind, once and for all, from superstition and age-old spiritual bondage. It encourages independent, free and consistent thought. >Marxism-Leninism regards the world as it actually is, without adding an invented hell or paradise. It proceeds from the fact that all nature, including man himself, consist of matter with its different properties. >Nature, as well as all its individual phenomena, is in constant process of development. The laws of that development have not been ordained by God and do not depend on man’s will. They are intrinsic in nature itself and are fully knowable. There are no inherently unknowable things in the world; there are only things which are still unknown, but which man will increasingly get to know.” >– Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Manual; Second Edition, Foreign Languages Publishing House Moscow 1963, pages 15-16. Can a Marxist-Leninist be religious? Yup. Is it a contradiction? For a dialectical materialist, a Marxist-Leninist, yes, it's a contradiction. Should an aspiring Marxist-Leninist strive to 'close all doors against belief in the supernatural'? Yes, they should. ",t3_abac1j,communism

"I think it is likely that there were differences between the Stalin and Mao eras, but they were subtle, not these fundamental divergences. Institutions may have just been not fully balanced from either end of the 'central-decentral poles' of learning, teaching, organizing, and implementing policy. One was 'too central' and the other 'not central enough,' and they struggled for balance in their particular histories. And basically, nothing is revealed by reducing everything to 'Stalin was a bureaucrat' or 'Mao was an ultra.' Why do you think China continued revolution, but the USSR abandoned it? If their material basis was similar, what would create two very different divergences? Did Stalin even attempt to teach a few proteges who could have replaced him? Does it make me sound like an aristocrat for preferring that type of General-Secretary succession of power? I wouldn't say it's aristocratic, because it's based on meritocracy, not birthright. And it's not without merit, as long as the successor has legitimacy in the eyes of the masses, and continues the ideological and material campaign against capitalism. That's a great point about checking the signs of proletariat-peasant unity (or lack of) through prioritized development. I would just say not to sell the Lenin and Stalin leaderships short. They, the party, and the state appealed to, accepted in, educated, and organized millions of rural comrades who made their plans of nationalization and collectivization at all possible (Lynne Viola's book is considered definitive, as far as I know). An effort was certainly made to incorporate them, but the violence of collectivization was like any other violence, stamped with the mark of class. Yes, kulaks were certainly upset, but it seems as if many MLs dismiss that many middle and poor peasants were part of the struggle. It's complicated, and at the end of the day, it's not about whether the leadership made 'enough of an effort,' because that's not scientific. Regardless of the intentions, clearly the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry had begun to be severed. And I would add that Amin and his school need to not underplay how fundamentally industrialization was perceived by the early Soviets as their competitive advantage and key to 'catch up' with the West Quoting Amin from *Russia and the Long Transition from Capitalism to Socialism*, 'What was the Soviet leadership to do? Attempting to push for peaceful coexistence by making concessions, if necessary, and refraining from intervening too actively on the international stage was one option. Yet at the same time, it was necessary to be armed to face new attacks, which were difficult to avoid. That implied rapid industrialization, which, in turn, came into conflict with the interests of the peasantry and thus threatened to break the worker-peasant alliance, the foundation of the revolutionary state.' Amin is not in the interest of condemning the Bolsheviks for making bad policy decisions. That's rather liberal. (Perhaps he was in 1981, but he had grown since then, as we all do.) It's not about a blame game. We just want to understand why revisionism developed in the USSR, and hopefully draw some lessons to apply to our conditions today. It's not about denunciation, although it's easy to assume any criticism is in that vein, since we deal with Trots and leftcoms being shits about the USSR. Amin understands that the Bolsheviks were in a lose-lose situation, either break the worker-peasant alliance, or remain backwards and underdeveloped and unable to defend of imperialism. And all that being said, perhaps it can be argued that this is where a radically new understanding of imperialism could come in handy to change the way we interact on the world stage, such that imperialism doesn't threaten the worker-peasant alliance.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"This never made much sense to me. American history is full of hardworking people who spent their lives fighting for communism while Chinese history is full of mistakes and opportunists who jumped on the CCP bandwagon when it was convenient. The Nanching uprising was a greater mistake than anything in American history, at least in terms of number of human beings involved. Do we really believe that Cuban revolutionaries 'tried harder' than Bolivian or Argentinian revolutionaries? How many people need to work hard for a successful revolution? Because no one thinks they are the ones making mistakes, it's always everybody else. The Bolshevik revolution is easy to read in this way: the hardworking Lenin against the opportunistic Bela Kun, the ultra-leftist Amadeo Bordiga and Rosa Luxemburg, the rightist Eugene Debs or theoretically eclectic Bill Haywood, etc. (with all of these figures as symbolic stand ins for the general left movement in each country). Lenin himself basically writes in these terms in *Left Wing Communism.* But I am forced to agree with Maoism: not only did the Stalin era show that the unity and theoretical correctness of the Bolsheviks was anything but and the party was in fact filled with opportunists, rightists, ultra-leftists, and even reactionaries but no revolution has resembled the Bolshevik revolution since despite every party following its model since. Either the solution to this conondrum is a conspiracy-type of thinking: every failure is the result of not correctly implementing the true Bolshevik method, sometimes with the more structural explanation that the USSR/Stalin sabotaged this through the comintern because they hated communism I guess; or it is a more structural Maoist concept of people's war as a generalizable method of third world revolution (the idea that it is also applicable to the first world I think is an unfortunate fusion of Maoism and Trotskyist slavish adherence to the Bolshevik method as 'universal') which is has been repeated many times. Of course that doesn't mean effort doesn't matter, rather that it is probably necessary but not sufficient and that there is a range of possible mistakes that can be made given certain structural conditions. People's war is full of failures as well and seems to be less and less relevant as neocolonialism develops (Nepal being both the most backwards country in terms of integration into neo-colonialism because of its subordination to Indian backwards imperialism and the place where a successful New Democratic revolution seems to be dying against the pressure of neo-colonial financial imperialism and global commodity production - a lot is riding on the success of India and the Philippines for updating Maoism while retaining its core as essentially correct - unfortunately the partial successes and ultimate failure of Peru does not seem to have changed very much in terms of theory). But to me it's the only theory that fuses politics with historical materialism and goes beyond magical thinking about what the right political line and the most amount of effort can achieve.

"'The change in policy started with Stalin' In this particular case, it did not lead to leadership difference or policy change because the United States was against having a real peace with the Soviet Union. Stalin gave his okay to the Sovietizing of Eastern Europe in 1948. This was after multiple Moscow Conferences failed (to reach outlines for a unification agreement) and the Marshall Plan was applied comprehensively across Europe, as opposed to bilaterally (which was the Soviet position) between countries. Then, Truman basically declared war (appealing to Poland and Romania, at a time when nothing as irreversible as Sovietization had happened in either country). Sovietization of Eastern Europe was then accepted policy until 1989. 'It's possible that the war had a greater influence on Soviet ideological leadership than Great Men theorists claim.' I can't believe the framework is as understudied as it is. The only notable book that at all tries to look at geopolitics as the framework where Stalin (and his leadership) were often forced to pursue their domestic policy is the book Stalin: Revolutionary in an Era of War (2006) by Kevin McDermott. 'will vary from country to country and region to region.' That's what I was getting at. Maybe my phrasing was poor. 'its concept of the social neutrality of technology is evidence of this.' Wasn't this naive perspective fairly universal back in the day though? I mean, the perspective of 'socializing and politicizing science and technology' was  controversial across mainstream academic disciplines two decades ago, and probably is now. 'The economism of Leninism contained the seed of a choice that would gradually make the goal of catching up triumph over the goal of the alternative.' I don't disagree that there was a choice, but it was rooted in reality and not theory, and Leninism didn't fail because it was lacking in the balancing of those choices. If there was a leadership prepared to continue that intensive competition with the West, it could have succeeded (at great risk internally) as others did (England, Japan, Germany) against the United States after 1973. The failure is that the USSR swung from one end of the choice to the other, and relied on the unsustainable option of welfarism. You can't place that lack of vision and inevitable failure on Leninism.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"Spot on. The Senators of SPA are the ones who really have power, they are not elected by Party but by person, everyone older than 17 can present him/herself without much problem, and if the people vote for them, they are accepted, then the SPA votes for different charges, the only reason that Kim Jong-Un stays as Chairman of the WPK, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army is because the SPA wants so, thats only because of the respect they have to Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, its also very common to see they are a 'hereditary monarchy', while the truth is, as they have similar positions, they dont actually have inherited any charge. At this moment, the Head of State, that has more power than Kim Jong-Un, is the President of the SPA, at this moment Kim Yong-Nam (No, he is not a familiar of the Kim ''Dinasty'', he just has the same surname, normal considering Kim is the most common surname in both Koreas), the position of Kim Jong-Un is that of the already mentioned Chairman of the WPK, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, also he has the title of 'Supreme Leader', but that is mostly honorary, the real person with power in the DPRK right now is Kim Yong-Nam.

"I think people are misinterpreting what they're saying - queer theory individualizes the oppression that comes from sex, when Marxists should critique the existence of gender roles as a whole. Sex-based oppression, through the institution of marriage and the family, oppresses women and allows men to pass property to their progeny. From *Origin of the Family* : &#x200B; >Monogamous marriage comes on the scene as the subjugation of the one sex by the other; it announces a struggle between the sexes unknown throughout the whole previous prehistoric period. In an old unpublished manuscript, written by Marx and myself in 1846, \, published after Engels’ death – Ed.\] I find the words: “The first division of labor is that between man and woman for the propagation of children.” And today I can add: The first class opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the male. &#x200B; This is where gender roles, heterosexuality, and the ideas of femininity and masculinity come from - as a tool to oppress one sex by the other for the means of maintaining private property. LGBT people face this secondary oppression that comes from gender roles, but queer theory analyzes this oppression in terms of individual experiences. Rather than seeing that all GNC or LGBT face this same oppression, it treats them as separate identities, like transfeminine, nonbinary, transmasculine, etc. &#x200B; &#x200B;",t3_a49kla,communism

"It may be trite, but I find that approaching class struggle in the same way one might approach competitive sports quite useful. As Marx wrote, communism isn't a noun ('a state of affairs to be established') but rather a verb ('the real movement which abolishes the present state of thing'), it's not something we *believe in* but rather something we *do*. As others have mentioned, it is possible to find a reprieve from depression in *doing* communism: in meeting with your comrades, in fighting for concessions for the working class, in helping others to understand capitalism. Indeed, there is evidence that helping others is the only behaviour which has shown a sustained increase in peoples' happiness, and communism (when done correctly) is an act of helping others. And this is where the sports analogy is useful, as what matters isn't necessarily that you've won or lost a particular struggle--often this is determined by factors beyond your control--but that you've taken part to the best of your ability. I find solace in this, in knowing that I am part of something far bigger than myself, that spans continents and centuries, and that will exist, long after I'm dead, until it succeeds.",t3_a2u6bp,communism

"The left used to see nationalization of the media as one of the minimum goals for a democratic society. That battle has been lost in the West as even socialists call news from China or Cuba 'state media' and advocate for the proliferation of sources (as can be seen in this thread) rather than their centralization and democratic control. In the mean time, megacorporations like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit survive on the free labor of their users, including those on the left, and do not even have the minimal accountability that the news media is supposed to. Today's hashtag movements instead attempt to harness capitalism through the media by pressuring individuals or corporations' marketability and PR and actually enhancing corporate power (the common argument being that freedom of speech narrowly applies to a trail by jury while one has no rights at all in the private sector, while conveniently the justice system and the media become increasingly privatized). I think the only solution is to abandon ship, socialists of the future will have to look to China for what national news media looks like under the monopoly of American tech companies and leave the American left to collapse in on itself once everything has been privatized. Media will have to be decolonized before any utopian dream is possible and the present corporations will have to be destroyed rather than merely taken over. ",t3_a2kjln,communism

"Except there are millions of eyewitness accounts of the holocaust. Millions of survivors. Millions of civilians and soldiers who personally witnessed those horrors. We can study the Nazi concentration camps. We can see and touch the crematoriums with our own eyes, and hands. For the “holodomor”, we have two biased, discredited accounts written by fascists at the time, which have been relied upon ever since, and exaggerated to extreme degrees. The fascists themselves never once claimed that there were any more than 6 million dead (and even then, that was discredited - not just at the time, but many times since), but their words were twisted by others over the years, to the point where many have thrown around a “20 million” figure. There’s plenty of evidence in the public record that the Soviet state actually sent millions of pounds of grain TO the Ukraine during that period in an overwhelming, concerted effort to feed the people, even though Kulaks had burned millions of pounds worth of grain themselves, and slaughtered tens of millions of domesticated animals to sabotage the collectivization efforts. There’s actual proof that the Kulaks did this, in order to initiate an intentional famine - and that the Soviet state went to great lengths in order to *prevent* the mass death that is usually attributed to Stalin himself (it’s usually called a “punitive famine”). And that’s just the “holodomor” portion of this propaganda. Comparing someone taking issue with fascist propaganda meant to smear socialists to Holocaust denial is fucking disgusting, honestly.

"Like Domenico Losurdo says, the concept of totalitarianism was created to obfuscate the fluidity between settler colonialism, colonialism, imperialism and fascism/Nazism and how they are bound by white supremacy and the contradictions of liberalism and capitalism. That Hitler and Stalin are so often compared when in reality the former has more in common with Winston Churchill or the collective genocidal efforts of US leadership shows the vacuousness of liberal thought. They try to justify the comparison by saying that the *idealism* of their grand plans (Hitler to create Aryan paradise by exterminating Jews and enslaving Slavs and Stalin’s plan to create a communist “utopia”) was the driving force behind their brutality and “totalitarian” control. However, Hitler’s vision was borne out of the material contradictions created by capitalism which originally created the white supremacy necessary to justify the slavery and colonialism imperative to building capitalism in its infancy and later to justify the imperialism to sustain it and then save it in its twilight. Communism, Stalin, et al. were the natural reaction to the violent contradictions in society created by capitalism and its regimes, not merely ideals imposed on society from high. The united states, Churchill, Hitler and the rest attempted to enslave in order to profit, whereas communists have always been on the defensive to break free from enslavement and eliminate exploitation.

"They are everywhere on the political spectrum. Let's just remind a short quote from Lenin: *“Whoever expects a 'pure' social revolution will never live to see it.'* The working class is, more often than not, very diverse in their opinions, with a lot of progressive and retrograde elements in their demands. Not to mention all organized forces (and so, more consequential) that are vying for leadership. As Lenin also once said, as far as the insurrection advances, and depending on which social force is leading, the abstract demands can become other things. Sometimes it's just a matter of filling empty words (such as 'liberty', 'democracy') with a revolutionary or neoliberal meaning, sometimes is about sweeping it all off and making new requests. A better question for a Leninist to ask is: what social force is driving it? what social force is backing it? What social forces are in direct opposition of interests to those of the forces driving *and* backing it? In the French case, we're talking about the gas price. Now who can afford a car in France? According to a comrade of mine, who spent some months in the country, not even the middle class can afford that luxury in the country of the gauls. The claims are for 'increase of purchasing power', which would be made by 'tax cut'. That can tell us something already. And we haven't even started with the organized forces yet. That would be another ride completely, as for Le Pen and Melenchon are trying to buy it for them, but the France Insoumise seems to be relying on a very naive reading that people in the streets are always legitimate and can only mean that full socialism is at the door and Macron will be the next Kerensky or something like that.",t3_a6e8lh,communism
"he is pointing to the fact, that if fine wines need to be kept in vats for a longer period of time as opposed to cheaper wines, then that would seem to contradict the labour of theory value. no you can increase the production capacity in order to make up for the lower production rate per barrel, and hence the higher price of fine wine would be derived from requiring more labour to run the larger facility. Picture this the wine maker figures out how to make a higher quality of wine by letting it sit longer in barrels, now the longer time of wine-production means that the barrels will produce less wine during their life-cycle giving off more of their embodied labour per bottle of wine that is produced, raising the price by an increase in cost of production, and additionally the price will increase because the wine producer is able to get super-profits because the wine is of higher quality. these super-profit will either be used by the wine maker to scale up production or will entice competing wine producers to also produce the higher quality wine. Production will go up until nobody gains super-profits anymore, this will obviously take a longer time because the initial ramp-up of production requires you to wait for the first batch of high quality, but as soon as production is running, you get inputs (grapes , equipment, labour ) and the time it takes for the inputs to be transformed into fine wine, will only show up as rate of production. If after the initial ramp-up time the price does not tend towards to labour-content then you got rent in there, maybe because scarcity of the land area for win-yards is being exploited by land-owners or you got collusion between producers to artificially limit the quantity of fine wine. At the end of technical improvement process you get 'scifi food sequencer' that produces a liquid with a pattern of fine wine.

"This is a kind of Maoist magical thinking which is indicative of a more general first world utopian socialism. That Cuba should have diversified its economy away from sugar is obvious, Cubans were the ones who said this. The question is what was *possible.* Rather than seriously engaging this question, China and Cuba are compared as if this comparison is possible. That China can be self-sufficient, given certain inefficiencies, is pretty obvious: it's the most populous country in the world covering much of the Earth. A much better comparison is Albania or North Korea, but the authors are so ideologically blind they cannot even acknowledge the economies of these countries exist. A single case study is not enough to seriously make this kind of argument, and the realities of both China and Cuba are papered over by ideology: not enough mass line; not enough faith in socialism's ability to develop the productive forces; too much faith in the USSR. a conspiracy of bourgeois nationalist leaders prevented the revolution from being what it could have been, etc. Let's take a concrete example: >Cuba’s apparent lack of sufficient oil is a very serious obstacle. It has been argued that Cuba’s poverty in hydrocarbons (oil, gas and coal) and hydroelectric potential (damable rivers) leaves it little choice but to rely on sugar cane, which is said to be “solar-powered,” if it is to avoid an even greater dependency in consequence of the development of industries that could only run on imported oil.[83] First of all, however, Cuba does produce some oil, and it could not be ruled out that in the future a revolutionary Cuba might repeat China’s experience of a country formerly declared “oil-poor” by Western experts that became self-sufficient in oil, thanks to the massive efforts of Chinese workers and technicians to solve problems of oil exploration and production. Current Cuban government policy is to discard this possibility; recently, exploration drilling at Veredero, considered to be a promising site for oil, was abandoned when Castro decided to develop tourism at Veredero instead.[84] >Second, Cuba has made great strides in using bagasse (the dry pulp that remains after the sugar has been ground from the stalks) as fuel. Experience in other countries shows that bagasse and bagasse-derived products (such as alcohol) can power industry and transportation. Brazil’s success in this was spectacular, until the falling price of oil internationally made it cheaper than ethanol, and the law of value demanded that this measure of potential economic independence be abandoned. So far, Cuba has used bagasse mostly to power the cane industry, rather than to attack its tyranny. Thirdly, much of Cuba’s imported oil is used to fuel the processing of export products, such as nickel, which is one of the biggest single industrial consumers of energy; a revolutionary Cuba would halt this policy. The first part is pure lunacy: does anyone seriously believe Cuba could be self-sufficient in oil and that what is preventing this is a government conspiracy to remain underdeveloped? Of course not, rather this is suggested as a possibility to plant it in your mind. If you believe Cuba can be self-sufficient in oil, show it empirically. If not, who cares about your speculation? The second part is also magical thinking. The comparison to Brazil is equally absurd as the comparison to China while the two empirical claims: bagasse could replace oil to power modern industry and the importation of oil is used inefficiently and would be sufficient to develop modern industry given a different economic configuration. These could be shown empirically and are worthless until they are, but of course they are not because they are obviously untrue. Instead the idea is planted to talk about 'tyranny,' as if it is tyranny that put oil in the ground in Saudi Arabia instead of nature. There's nothing really to engage with since the empirical evidence is not sufficient to make the claims put forward. The argument itself is fine since the structure is straightforward and the evidence marshaled to the cause is what one would need to make such an argument; it's simply insufficient. One sees a similar argument about Venezuela: it should have diversified away from oil and its current economic troubles are the result of this. That's not an argument, that's an observation of what's obvious. The question is what was possible, and in this regard critics have nothing to say. Venezuela is of course much less socialized than Cuba, but considering the general failure of the non-aligned movement and de-linking, to make this argument in 2018 is so bizarre. Obviously this piece comes from 1989 (and the majority of evidence is really from 1966 and is regurgitated from an RCP polemic from the 70s), and the arguments about the USSR and Tianamen Square have not aged well, but for you to call it contemporary (as if Hoxhaists even exist anymore) obscures what's going on. If you're really interested, the best case studies like I mentioned are North Korea and Albania. Albania went the furthest in delinking from imperialism and 'revisionist' socialist countries, to the point where it was almost completely self-sufficient given extremely limited resources. Study why Albania collapsed, especially since it's a kind of alternate history where Stalin never died and anti-revisionism lasted until the 80s. North Korea was not as extreme but similarly went out of its way to develop indigenous forms of energy and production (Vinylon is the most well know) as this article suggests for Cuba. What happened to North Korea and what is happening now? It is turning towards China and is attempting to attract foreign investment. Is this the result of revisionist leadership betraying the revolution? It's a convenient explanation, anyway. But how many times can the same thing happen before it stops being betrayal by remarkably similar amoral individuals and it starts being a structural phenomenon? At least Trots are honest and reject third world liberation as impossible because of underdevelopment, they don't have to engage with reality at all instead of picking and choosing the parts they like.

"I'm under the impression that any sufficiently radical anarchist will eventually find a lot of common ground with marxists. I think both Kropotkin and Bookchin show that very clearly. Kropotkin's The Conquest of the Bread had plenty of similar theory to Das Kapital, except it was less rigorous. Bookchin understood the importance of a vanguard (and that wasn't exactly new in anarchism, considering that the plataformists were a thing). But I think they lacked the guts to just fully radicalize and admit that you can't get rid of power without first seizing power. ",t3_aa15bn,communism

"I think Amin's criticism of democratic centralism is not so much in the formal methodological outline, but rather more in its extensions, as I cited, how it supposedly ignores the diversity of material subsets within the People. Obvious examples include ethnic chauvinism. It would be easy for ethnic chauvinism to become law policy according to the democratic centralist model. But furthermore, it reduces diversity of opinion in the proletariat to just ideas, rather than bringing to attention the material basis for disagreement (race, gender, etc.). I remember reading about this being a big deal during the cultural revolution, where . The method of discipline seems to be dubious as well. As Mao wrote in 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People,' he says (very generally) that contradictions between the people need to be handled in a non-antagonistic manner. Forcing unity among people aren't fundamentally united requires more than just having the minority not talk about it. Unity is fostered, not imposed. Of course the specific way to foster unity will develop on the type of contradiction and the context, but to reduce the solution to discipline is incredibly short-sighted. I again cite China's erasure of womanhood during the cultural revolution. Now, I don't identify as Maoist, mainly for the reasons you cite. But the universality of the main principles in the abstract can and should be more of a guide, the way you say MLs view Marxism Leninism. Protracted People's War doesn't need to be dogmatic. Everything is protracted, so that's a given. And as socialists, we're waging People's War. The question of base areas is strategically useful in a lot of cases, but the CCP finding its base areas in the rural areas doesn't need to be dogmatically applied everywhere. The mass line, however is indispensable, as is New Democracy for any peripheral economy. It's the only model for the development of the productive forces with consistent success. By eliminating the bourgeoisie, you limit your potential for development (see Dengist reforms), but by granting the bourgeoisie political power, you risk the ultimate reversal of all your gains. To quote Amin on the topic (in French, my translation — hope it's coherent), The bourgeoisie of the peripheries constitute one single class, which, according to the moments of history, either accepts comprador submission to dominant capital on the global level, or it develops nationalist behaviors. When the circumstances allow it – these circumstances are largely ordered by international power relations, more or less favorable to the domination of imperialism – the bourgeoisie in question strives to use the available margins of maneuverability to follow the 'national road.' In other moments, when these margins shrink, the bourgeoisie accepts to join in comprador capitalist development. These are the same 'bourgeois' which are thus national or comprador according to the circumstances. The bourgeoisie is by nature an opportunistic class. Of course, at the heart of this type of bourgeoisie, fragile by nature, many are only ever brought to comprador behaviors of permanent vassal submission. But these bourgeois do not play a huge role compared to those who, at the heart of the same class, follow the national road when it appears to offer some possibilities to advance. And The anti-imperialist/anti-feudal/People's Democratic (and not bourgeois democratic) revolution associates diverse classes and social, ideological, and cultural forces. It cannot be a 'revolution of the proletariat.' As it happens, the proletariat is hardly embryonic and weak in all of the societies of the modern peripheries thus far. The revolution must be just as much that of the majority of peasants, oppressed and exploited. It must be that of important segments of the educated middle class which expresses itself in the revolutionary intelligentsia. It can neutralize (without eliminating) the political intervention of the local bourgeoisie, which tries to slow down the movement towards socialism. It can even favor [create the conditions for] the shift of the bourgeoisie in question from its natural comprador behavior towards holding national positions. He outlines the necessity for New Democracy. And it's not just a Maoist concept. Most socialist countries (notably excluding the USSR) have used a similar model to develop. Vietnam, the DPRK, Cuba, whatever. They have always tolerated some local bourgeois presence, as they should. As far as formally theorized Maoism is concerned, though, their dogmatic attachment to the Cultural Revolution (which was itself an ultra left deviation from the rest of Mao's thought) is my biggest beef with most Maoists, and why many Maoists tend towards armchair revolutionary positions concerning currently existing socialism. Lastly, on the rejection of the synthesis, it really seems like common sense, as not every contradiction (between thesis and antithesis) results in the creation of a new synthesis. Oftentimes the thing remains fundamentally unchanged, perhaps quantitative change. On Contradiction doesn't deliberately reject the synthesis, but it does not frame dialectical materialism within the Hegelian discourse of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. It's all just contradictions. In fact, there's a worthy case to be made that the Hegelian model of dialectics is itself metaphysical, as the rest of his worldview was idealist. The way Marxists can force things into this model rather than develop a less restrictive model to understand dialectics demonstrates the unscientific nature of the Hegelian model. Juche describes itself as distinct from Marxism Leninism. It says that ML is the right ideology for Russia, but not for Korea, because Korea is culturally distinct. Detractors say that Juche is idealist and should mostly be rejected by serious Marxists. The hard thing is though, it's hard to find any works written by any of the Kims formally theorizing Juche. Maybe there's systematic censorship, or maybe just a lack of translation. Whatever the cause, it has prevented me from reading about it as deeply as I would like. ",t3_a6uhyu,communism
"This is a really good post but I think it’s also important to assess each failure within the confines of the material conditions and real situation at the time. For the CPUSA, many failures can be attributed due to being in the heart of the imperialist state, but also due to many failures of its members. The Nanchang uprising and similar failures in China were terrible setbacks that would’ve destroyed the party if it weren’t for (1) Mao, who has circumvented the CC’s orders and instead of attacking cities built up a rural base area, and (2) the composition and practice of the Red Army and CCP under Mao, whose levelheaded analysis of villages and land reforms caused their support, if not their presence, to be national and not just confined to some areas. Wherever the Red Army went after the 1930s their fame preceded them. When Mao went to peace talks with Chiang Kai Shek, thousands of people in Kuomintang areas crowded to see him. Of course, we can not blame just the party’s failures for their losses. But it is only through the *creative* application of Marxism Leninism to the corresponding conditions that we will be able to successfully win revolution. Copying the Bolshevik model is bad, because no country directly mirrors Tsarist Russia.

"First off, that everybody works in a communistic society (economic or governmental) is laughable. When people are given the chance to do so, they will do less work if the amount they receive for it remains equal. There is no incentive without recognition of the value of the self. Look at what happened to the Soviet Union. Once a week, the proletariat would get the word, and drop everything they were doing to spend hours in line just to get whatever inkling of sugar may or may not have been available. This occurred because nobody was able to \*capitalize\* on such an investment as a grocery store. Compared to this, Keynesian economics is much more of a welcomed idea. If working is replaced by automation (currently the number of jobs being created has increased - I believe more automation means more jobs, honestly), and we run out of things for people to do, and machines have gotten to the point of fixing themselves, and developing plans for expansion and differentiation of business in a perfect model without need for payment, then this frees us to pursue artistry, or such intellectual pursuits as an egalitarian society, but until then, those who work hardest, and with an industrial ingenuity should be rewarded for doing as such, simply by the nature of their pursuit. This is always the basis for why Marxists believe factory workers should reap the lion's share of production, but you see, such a society does not promote entrepreneurship, and those who would otherwise structure a society in a manageable way would then be stuck in a 5 hour long queue at the grocer for the daily ration of bread. Production would halt as fear spread, and eventually a brutal genocide on a large scale would occur. Famine would be the norm, and you can absolutely forget about any definition you know today of a basic human right. &#x200B;",t3_a5fhxs,communism

"Actually, your comments demonstrate quite eloquently that the US has revolutionary potential. The US is a world power which, although immensely rich and powerful, is decaying. The US is rich to a very large extent because everyone is forced to use the US dollar as reserve currency, and because international payments must be cleared through the US banking system. However, with some very notable high-tech exceptions, it is decaying as an industrial power. It buys immense quantities of cheap goods from China with their own dollars as payment. Internally, the US has many pockets of deep (and deepening) poverty whilst the standard of living for most people is flat lining or declining. Much of the infrastructure put in during the Eisenhower era is now crumbling, and I wouldn't be surprised to soon see major bridges (for example) collapsing. The country is in the throes of an out of control opioid epidemic which is so bad that it has statistically lowered the life expectancy in the US. It has elected the most unsuitable man you could imagine (if you have vivid imagination) to the office of President of the United States. Incredibly, electing Killary would have been even worse. Everyone seems to hate the federal government with a vengeance whilst simultaneously venerating the office of the President of the United States and the completely out-of-date constitution with a odd kind of semi-religious fervour. I could go on for some time... In summary, looking at the US from the outside, it looks like a complete mess. However, what is also pretty apparent is a change in mood in a minority of the population, a distinct tendency towards socialism and communism which wasn't present 20-30 years ago. To me, it looks like the US is in a pre-revolutionary stage perhaps akin to what was going on in the late 19th Century in Imperial Russia.",t3_a21irq,communism

So if they had total sexual freedom, what would end up happening is that the majority of males on earth would get 0 female attention. We are already seeing this on online dating. It was the patriarchy that ensured this catastrophe would not be reached: through mechanisms such as marriage, slut-shaming, and the family unit, patriarchy ensured 1 man for every 1 woman, and so everybody was happy. But now, it is only the top males monopolizing all the women with casual sex. So it is no wonder that since 3rd wave feminism became the name of the game and women got more spots in colleges and were more accommodated and given preference for high paying jobs, women in the west no longer need a male partner, so they are free to go on tinder and have casual hook up after hook up with top tier males much above their own level of looks who will never stay with them past a hook up. This is actually not causing women to be any happier: what they desperately want is an actual long term partner, but because they have sexual freedom, they are not able to control their biology and thus will make the mistake of going with the better looking man every time, and getting pumped and dumped over and over again. Women do not have the power to curb their own biology. That is why patriarchy was implemented and did it for them. It worked perfectly, until 3rd wave feminism replaced patriarchy and has caused this shit show. Now, it is 2018, we have at least some remnants of patriarchy which have so far prevented this from being a catastrophe, but with EVERY PASSING year, there are more and more women who become like this. In about 10 years or so it will climax and the shit will hit the fan. That is what I mean by Western society will be destroyed. ",t3_a2gbet,communism

"An excerpt from *Chapter III, Section One, of “China’s Socialist Economy” by Xue Muqiao, 1981, pages 45-50*: Chapter III Two Systems of Socialist Ownership 1: Important Differences Between the Two Systems By 1956, the means of production in the country were generally placed under socialist ownership, which nevertheless took two different forms, i.e., ownership by the whole people in the state economy and collective ownership in the co-operatives. In 1956, the agricultural producers’ co-operatives developed into rural people’s communes. In 1967, with the abolition of the fixed interest paid to private industrialists and businessmen, joint state-private enterprises became state enterprises or, in other words, the came under the ownership of the whole people. Recent years have seen the establishment of industries run by communes or production brigades in rural areas, which are under collective ownership, and the appearance of new collective enterprises in cities and towns. These have been important developments in the two systems of socialists ownership since 1956. Ownership by the whole people and collective ownership are both socialist in nature. The difference lies in the degree of maturity. The former is a higher form of socialist public ownership under which the means of production belong to all the working people as represented by the state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Such means of production are essentially the public property of society as a whole. Collective ownership is a lower form of social public ownership, under which the means of production are not yet the public property of society as a whole but belong to the working people in one economic collective or another. In the economic sector under collective ownership, production is carried on with the leadership and support of the socialist state economy, and the main economic operations are geared to the needs of the government and the people through state planning and other economic measures. The exchange of products between state on collective economy and among the economic collectives must basically conform to the principle of equal exchange. Thus in its internal and external relations, the collective economy is a socialist economy which rules out the exploitation of man by man. Ownership by the whole people is a more developed form of socialist public ownership. Here production is carries out by plan and is aimed at fulfilling the rising material and cultural requirements of society as a whole. At present, however, ownership by the whole people in China co-exists with collective ownership. The products of labour in the former economic sector, after deductions are made for whatever is consumed in production, are finally divided into two major categories: the accumulation fund and consumption fund. The accumulation fund is handled by the state according to unified state plans and policies. The consumption fund, especially the part earmarked for individual consumption, is mainly distributed among the staff and workers of state enterprises. Members of the economic collectives, mostly the peasants, divide among themselves the income of their collectives and receive nothing from the individual consumption funds in the sector under ownership by the whole people. This results in differences in the pay for people working under the two systems of ownership. In this sense, the system of ownership by the whole people we have today is still incomplete. It cannot develop into a complete one until it becomes a unitary system covering the whole economy, ending the co-existence of the two systems, so that the country’s consumption fund is distributed in a unified way among all the working people and no differences arise from different systems of ownership. Collective ownership is an immature form of socialist public ownership. The economic sector under collective ownership differs from the one under ownership by the whole people in that each economic collective is an independent owner. Each owns some means of the production and the products of labour belong to its members. After deductions are made for whatever is consumed in production and for the fund of accumulation to be turned over to the state, the products are handled by the collective, which sets aside an accumulation fund for its own use and distributes the consumption fund within itself. The members of a collective have an equal right of ownership, but different collectives are unequal in their possession of means of production. Differences in the quantity and quality of the means of production in the possession of the collectives, plus the differences in local natural and economic conditions, give rise to wide differences in labour productivity, output and the income from a given amount of labour. Since the collectives are responsible for their own profits and losses, the pay varies from one to another, and equal pay for equal work, which is basically practiced among state enterprises, is inapplicable among the collectives. Differences in the funds accumulated by the collectives determine the differences in the capacity for extended reproduction. The economic sector under collective ownership bears quite a few birthmarks of the old society. We may say that it is an immature form of socialist public ownership, or public ownership at a low level. The two systems of public ownership of the means of production account for the existence of two types of working people in socialist society: the working class and the peasantry. As industry is predominated by ownership by the whole people and agriculture by collective ownership, the working class and the peasantry are often regarded as typical of the working people in these two sectors. The existence of the two systems of socialist public ownership in socialist society within a given period is, in the final analysis, determined by the level of development of productive forces. Owing to the differences between industry and agriculture with respect to the levels of productive forces and labour productivity, the differences between the workers and the peasants in living standards cannot be eliminated within a short time. Differences in the conditions of material production and in labour productivity among collective economic units, coupled with the distribution of products within each collective, result in considerable differences in living standards among the peasants of different collectives. To effect distribution among the workers and peasants on a single basis of equal pay for equal work, the right thing to do is to bring up the income of the peasants gradually to the level of the workers’ wages, rather than to resort to egalitarianism by lowering the workers’ wages. Nor is egalitarianism the proper way to eliminate the differences in the income of peasants of different collectives, which should likewise be eliminated by raising the lower incomes and not by leveling off the higher ones. Peasants account for more than 80 per cent of China’s population. It is obviously impossible to raise the living standard of the peasants all at once, especially of those in low-yield communes and brigades, to the level of the workers without a protracted effort to achieve a tremendous growth in industrial and agricultural production. The major differences between the two systems of socialist public ownership, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, naturally give rise to contradictions between them. These include the contradictions between the state and the collectives and those between the working class and the peasantry. The contradictions between state and collective economy are those within the ranks of the people that are based on an identity of fundamental interests. If correct policies are adopted these contradictions can certainly be handled in such a way as to benefit the consolidation and development of the socialist economic system.",t3_a6az1r,communism

"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was a nationalist that literally descended from Ukrainian kulaks who had their familial land collectivized thus stripping them from their position as wealthy land owners. This is one of the main reasons he opposed the Soviet regime. His own wife spoke out about the gulag archipelago being fiction. Even wikipedia which strongly pushes western capitalist propaganda points this out in their page about it under criticisms. The gulag archipelago was written by him on the premise of it being a historical fiction describing life in a gulag. Its authenticity is solely based on the fact that he was imprisoned in one. He was placed there for spreading an anticommunnist and anti-Soviet ideal. Also the gulag system existed before the Soviets they did not design the gulags they were simply the exist prison systems in the Russian empire and the new Soviet republic could not afford to eliminate them initially, I do agree that they did send people there unnecessarily for minor offenses but that does not make them evil masterminds devising some sadistic prison system, also the gulag system was eliminated in the 1950's.

"I wrote something about this a while ago: >Even sadism can be brought to good use. For instance, I'm aware of my own impulses of sadism when confronted by Trotskyist views on imperialism and use those impulses to viciously attack their ideology, which they have earned through decades of destroying anti-imperialist momentum. I have, I admit, a phantasy of wanting to tear their ideology off as if it's flesh until only a skeleton remains to be seen as the grotesque reality of their support for imperialist murder. I did, after all, use 'For the destruction of liberalism' as the subtitle for this blog. I think Marxist-Leninists become aware that this kind of viciousness is simply appropriate in some circumstances, and anyway it's a natural impulse. Couching such impulses in only a life drive through *protection* seems to disavow something important. Sadistic phantasy sparked from confrontation with enemies can, I think, be ultimately positive if objectivity and humanity remains attended to. Our enemies, it must be kept in mind, are the enemies of humanity. Disavowing sadistic impulses while objectively evincing them seems more dangerous than an open appropriation. >This is where things admittedly get a bit murky, but it's always easy to present psychoanalytic interpretations of others and pretend that you're not subject to the same processes – lines must be drawn or the above presentation can be interpreted as merely a projection of projection. Many more words would be necessary for an attempt to situate these modes of psychological functioning in Marxist-Leninist praxis, but hopefully this speaks to how some aspects of regression can be dealt with. If read closely with an attention to the life and death drives, it's apparent that leaders like Mao were very much aware of how these forces existed and had ambivalent tendencies that could, if taken individually, lead to their own kinds of idealism. Remember Mao's reply to attempts to uncritically align Marxism-Leninism with the life drive: 'Communism is not love.

"I think it's inappropriate for Marxists to be focusing on the identity aspect of the trans experience. That's idealism and subjectivism. It's more appropriate to be focusing on the dysphoria aspect of it, whether it be dysphoria about your biology or about your social categorization. The failure to make this clarification is, in part, why some Marxist organizations become TERFs. On the other hand, some trans friendly Marxists take that famous Butler quote, about gender being performative, and say that to behave as the other gender is to be the other gender. This is usefully, but only marginally, as our society expands its definitions of masculinity and femininity, such that one's social category is not necessarily questioned by someone's interests and all. You're allowed to not fit the gender roles without having your social categorization questioned.",t3_a75fvu,communism

"Exactly, there were so many purges during Stalin's time, but they could not weed out Khrushchev. It can't simply be one man. There were so many people like Khrushchev, if it was not him, someone body else would have done it. There must be an underlying generating process that makes people look at things in this way. I bet if the USSR had overtaken the US and Western Europe, there would have been no revisionism. This is part of Stalin's approach to class struggle. He declared it pretty much over, and thus the rise of anti-Soviets to be purged did not have a class character, but they were simply traitors. We can learn from that. Perhaps you are right, but Deng was no Lenin. Lenin was more honest saying we are taking a step backwards while instituting the NEP, Deng looks more opportunistic in comparison, there is no talk of a retreat or anything similar. I see it just as a difference of perspective. Lenin is looking at the ideal, saying the NEP is less ideal than without it. The CCP is looking at the immediate demands of the revolution. Personally I tend to think the latter is a more appropriate attitude to take, but that's not something I'd make a big deal out of. Lenin's attitude does seem a little more idealist (instead of materialist), but it's really quite minor, not something work making a fuss over. I think those two reasons seem interesting, but there must be much more. Do you know if Khrushchev and his clique were from the country side? I have read that some collective farms grew extremely rich, millionaires in rubles. Maybe that also contributed. Well Khrushchev was from the countryside in Ukraine. I don't think that's meaningful in itself, though. Mao was from the countryside, and many others. As mentioned, the problem with the Soviet model for collectivization is that it broke the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. Khrushchev being from the countryside is insignificant, because, as we mentioned, revisionism had a material basis. The goal is to understand the material basis, rather than reducing it to people.",t3_a5uuwt,communism

"I think you're being too generous in your reading of Chomsky. In his first political book, the one on the Vietnam War whose name escapes me at the moment, he concludes it by advocating for liberal anti-war protests, condemning violence, etc. Liberalism is his modus operandi. Everybody knows that humanitarianism is not a guiding principle of US foreign policy. If that's all he's saying, he's adding nothing to the conversation. But he's saying more. He's saying that even while US foreign policy is not guided by humanitarianism, sometimes US interests align with the interests of humanitarianism. This is one of those cases, in his view. He is mistrustful of the US' intentions, but will welcome their continued occupation of northern Syria. I remember an interview I saw with him once, don't remember where or when. But he was asked if he could ever support US intervention, and he gave two cases when he would: National defense when diplomacy fails and humanitarian interests, assuming a leading role of the UN, etc. And in his book about 9/11, he argues from the premise that if the US had a legitimate reason to occupy Afghanistan, it would be okay. His argument is that diplomatic channels had not been exhausted. He has a history of liberalism. I don't know why you're being so generous to him.",t3_a8l015,communism

"By employing everyone. Simply because the market does not pay people to do certain work does not mean that there isn't work to be done or money to pay for it. Consider jobs that are notoriously neglected in a lot of the west, like infrastructure maintenance and repair. Roads and bridges are by their very nature in a state of constant decay and need constant maintenance. There are plenty of people capable of work who are none-the-less jobless. We have jobless people and peopleless jobs, the only barrier between them being money. Socialist societies pay people to do jobs that can't really turn a profit, not in spite of the fact that they do not turn a profit but because the labor is necessary for society and can be afforded by it.

">Holy crap, you sound like you could be talking about my father. He believes 'yahoodi' control the world, imperialism is nothing more than a Zionist conspiracy, blah blah blah, and yet has a degree from an Ivy League university. In fact, in my former community several people were highly educated (again, they grew up bourgeois in Pakistan, Egypt, or Lebanon) and yet they too held these beliefs. Haha, actually lots of people in my family also believe in such stuff, its pretty common. I know people who work in multi national banks who still think this way. I think it's just cognitive dissonance, the media says everything is fine, the government says we are on your side, but still everything keeps on getting worse and since 'Islam is true', the only alternatives are such theories. Read the piece I linked. You will enjoy it I think. >Very much so. I'd also add that in this case, you have old cultural relics like the honor/shame obsession whereby you *have* to maintain your honor (and family's honor) at all costs. You are literally not allowed to fail or show any deficiency since your entire family takes the blame for it (which is also linked to property relations and inheritance). That's a good point as well. Of course that all feeds into it, one concrete example that I can give is that if a child is born with a disability its instantly seen as a sign of disgrace, mothers sometimes try to hide such disabilities lest they lose face. I think that's because some flavours of Islam, are kind of like the Christian prosperity gospel ie if good things happen to you, that means you did some good deeds and if you are suffering, its because of your sins, essentially its the 'Just world fallacy'. Such thinking provides a lot of coherence to everyday events. That's why I think its so common. Also think I think all of this is also has something to do with Islamic eschatology ('Qaymat', 'coming of Dajjal'). Islamic eschatology provides a nice way to tie this all up.Perhaps you are familiar with the show 'The End of Times' ( A extremely popular show that seeks to show the signs of the end of times are coming true by analysing world events ). This show is an archetypical example of a desperate attempt to build a coherent world view. It's a perfect blend of conspiracy theories and theology trying to explain the modern capitalist world system. But on the bright.side I think their are inklings of change though. &#x200B;",t3_a6706r,communism

"Still, the commission writing the new constitution, headed by party chief Raul Castro, took the mention of “communism” out of the first draft that it published in July and put to a nationwide, three-month popular consultation. Thousands of citizens at community-level meetings then called for it to be re-inserted, according to Cuba’s state broadcaster, and as a result it was re-inserted into the draft now under debate by the national assembly. This is a confidence vote. Raul 'put it to a test' and the people decided. The inclusion of “communism” is one of 760 changes to the first draft made on the back of the popular consultation. This is all part of a longer process which has been ongoing in Cuba for months. , which highlights how the number of changes have boiled down from a larger list through democratic procedures: The Commission was informed of results from the recently concluded popular consultation, during which133, 681 meetings were held, with 8,945,521 persons attending. In these meetings, 1,706,872 citizens spoke, making 783,174 proposals, (666,995 modifications, 32,149 additions, 45,548 eliminations, and 38,482 requests for clarification). Likewise reported were 2,125 proposals made by Cubans living abroad. On the basis of evaluations and suggestions made by the work groups processing these results, the Commission conducted a detailed analysis and agreed to propose to the National Assembly of People’s Power a number of modifications to the draft Constitution of the Republic.

"I applaud your sense of self-preservation for your family and being wary of the future for us Reds, for us Marxists, but to not allow the persecution to take place then we must allow representation of our population to follow. We must show our country that we are not to be labeled unfairly as unamerican or a danger to society, but rather just another person with differing political views. I say, given a few years considering the increase in leftist views by the youth, that there will be more people that are accustomed and open to our viewpoints; just to the point of acceptance would be perfect for us. And only then shall we see, little by little, more governmental representation for our viewpoints and see more left representatives and more Marxist representatives.

If we allow ourselves to sit quietly and fade out then these events shall never occur and the youth shall not know that our viewpoint is an acceptable option or that there is an alternative to the cruel hand of capitalism.

"As far as I am aware Analytical Marxism, was an attempt to marry Marxian economics with Neo-classical ideas like 'rational choice theory' etc. I think Anwar Shaikh quite convincingly demolishes these cherished axioms of Neo-classical theory. Analytical Marxism was an attempt by western Marxist academics to gain some 'respectability' with their bourgeois peers. I think the following are very important developments in Marxian economics in the last few decades: # General Developments: 1. Anwar Shaikh's demonstration of how the so called 'transformation problem' occurs because of the failure to understand the concept of the 'form of value' in Marx. Essentially there is no 'transformation problem.' (Marx's Theory of Value and the Transformation Problem in The Subtle Anatomy of Capitalism, 1977). and 2. Anwar Shaikh's defence of Marxian economics against the Neo-Ricardians. (Neo-Ricardian Economics: A Wealth of Algebra, A Poverty of Theory, 1982) (The Poverty of Algebra in The Value Controversy, 1981) and (The Transformation from Marx to Sraffa, 1984) 3.

"How should we, as materialist dialecticians, approach this? how about starting by examing the material conditions For 9/11 it’s pretty simple, a few planes collided with buildings, the physical damage and loss of life wasn’t that dramatic compared to other factors that generate damage and loss of life. What produced the most damage was the repetitive drumbeat of the news outlets that distorted reality and poisoned the political discourse. Most populations with the siege mentality tend to be highly reactionary (American and European white supremacists, Israelis/Zionists, Hindutva nationalists, white people in Africa, etc.) in the sense that they already hold a lot of institutional power I would argue that this lacks class analysis. The owning classes are a tiny minority that does operate with siege mentality because they are sort of the ones that are usurping the group or society. And they use race as augmented reality to divert attention from them self’s, to a scape goat. I would say that the owning classes have mixed awareness of this, some might actually think the majority is out to get them, while others might be cynical realists that just adopt this as practically useful out-look on reality. Keep in mind that paranoia can be highly functional. For the people that fall for the 'race reality augmentation', while also having a working class status an as such do not have institutional power, and will end up fighting against their class allies, solidifying class rule. For example black workers and white workers have more common interests strategically then they have with people that have the same ethnic background but a different class background. If you look at the white police officers racially profiling black people, the here you can do a class analysis again. And find that race is again used a reality augmentation to paint over the enforcement of class society. Race is a symbolic order, it should be possible to at least reduce the priority enough so that it doesn't function as enabling factor for the destructive aspects of the siege mentality you describe. the feeling of being under siege has an advantage insofar as that it can motivate pretty drastic action and provides quite a bit of consciousness Well if you think this is true, then maybe there is a new synthesis where painting the society as under siege of the bourgeoisie, produces quite a bit of class consciousness ?

"Apparently I'm out of space... A lot of this is disingenuous. Centralizing the collective farms by combining them together into Trade Union Federations (including representatives from regional control commissions and smaller factory committees and farm cooperatives) and regulating them with plan-agreements by Central Offices (union leaders from central, regional, and local unions) and a Workers' Council (party representatives sent by the government, themselves from more centralized party-connected unions) was obviously the way to go (as it was done in the cities), but what wasn't obvious was how to do that without triggering another major war. Stalin more than likely knew 'what to do,' but Russia has a history of needing blood to change, and Stalin probably wasn't sure if it was time or was trying to find if there was another way. I know I rely too much on Amin for theoretical work, but he writes in an essay for the monthly review, *China 2013*, about how the Soviet agricultural policy made sense at the time concerning collectivization and all, but that we have learned more since then concerning the efficiency of agriculture. The accepted science was that more centralization = more efficiency, which apparently isn't necessarily true in agriculture as it is when comparing petty industry to bigger industry. Not really a criticism of Stalin, but still relevant here. I know it was written by a Bukharinite Nothing wrong with Bukharinites in my book. They're no Trotsky. I hope Mao didn't see this as a meaningful divergence because it makes it seem like him and his followers took a fair criticism (a lack of participatory democracy as an instrument of centralizing class struggle) and have turned it into a secular religion. This seems to be more of a Maoist thing than a Mao thing. The author(s) at Massline said that perhaps Mao liked Stalin before because Mao wasn't allowed to criticize Stalin... or maybe the 70-30 analysis was just correct? If China was purely committed to Maoism nowadays, I think it would be developing steadily (as it was in the 1970s, according to Joshua Eisenman's new book, Red China's Green Revolution), but it would not have the overall successful dynamic it has now (and I think that it has more roots in standard Marxism-Leninism), nor would it be the major force competing against the primary contradiction. Totally. Its reform towards dynamism is what has kept it afloat and even the biggest competitor to imperialism, compared to the USSR. And a small tangent, I'm really fed up with these proponents of the 'social imperialist' theory. Was not true of the Soviet Union, and it's not true of China. And your line isn't just poor, it's dangerous. ",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"Thanks for the thoughtful reply! You bring up very good points, I agree with them all. But why do you say that the EOI of South Korea or China is now impossible? I mean you are right that the Western markets are now beginning to close but can’t those markets be replaced with Eastern markets eg China ( especially once it can get rid of the parasitic value transfers to imperialism)? If that development path is truly closed then I agree with you that we are living in a world that is on the cusp of socialist revolutions, especially in the periphery. As regards to Japan, I just checked out that book right now upon your recommendation it looks super useful, its filled with amazing statistics! I noticed something interesting perhaps you already noticed it, as I was scrolling through the book (haven’t read it yet) I came upon page 19, where it shows the “Idealised operation of the gold standard in adjusting a nation’s trade balance.” It says that increased gold flows lead to price increases quoting Hume, this is Richardo’s incorrect comparative advantage theory of world trade. What’s interesting is that the author says that it never worked like so in practice and he quotes a book from 1987 to support his view, its as if he is not even aware that Marx critiqued that false theory more than 100 years before that book was even published. Further on the author says that the gold standard led to price deflation, that it completely contrary to actual history. As you know, Anwar Shaikh has shown in his famous golden waves, the era of the gold standard was known for its extreme price stability( except for the periods of the two world wars). It’s funny seeing bourgeoise economists/ historians still clueless after 150 years after Marx. Back to Japan, Trump is already pressuring Abe to reduce Japan’s trade surplus with the US. I think Japan is in for a very rough ride.",t3_a9lzuq,communism

">From 1778 to 1871, the United States negotiated treaties with various Indian tribes to support westward expansion. These treaties were agreements whereby Indian nations would exchange their rights to hunt and to live on parcels of land for trade goods, yearly cash payments, and the right to remain on part of their homelands. These treaties, which were almost wholly dishonored by the the U.S. government, helped set the stage for U.S. government actions such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Indian nations who resisted treaty attempts found themselves facing forced removal further westward to 'Indian Territories.'  Hunger was widespread throughout Dakota lands in Minnesota. Since crops had been poor in 1861, the Dakota had little food stored for the “starving winter” of 1861-62. Their reservation supported no game, and increasing settlement off the reservation meant more competition with Euro-Americans hunting for meat. Reports about government agents' corrupt treatment of the Dakota were ignored. Factionalism continued among the Dakota, as those who maintained traditional ways saw that only those who had acculturated were reaping government support. Finally, a delayed treaty payment made traders nervous, and many of them cut off credit to Dakota hunters. Indian Agent Thomas Galbraith refused to distribute food to the Dakota, and though Dakota farmers shared food with their relatives throughout the summer of 1862, it wasn’t enough.

The only problem is that the people here are not courageous enough for a revolution (just yet, I hope) and there's literally no good party in Hungary, baby steps I guess, but only a revolution would bring much change at this point.

"I'm not a professional translator, and parts of my translation may not be perfect. Apologies in advance. **The Yellow Jacket movement: our mirror** E. Vertuis Part 1 To develop a political line, for an organization or a party, is an easy job. You just need to affirm something and hold on to it as absolute truth. To develop a correct political line, on the other hand, is the job of a titan. It requires investigation, reflection, to understand a general situation just like the possible evolutions and the interaction of all the forces which are its motor or which could influence it. To possess a correct line is like walking on a thin line between leftist, adventurist deviations on the one hand which overestimate the difficulty, and in the other hand, rightist, moderate, deviations which prevent the development of the struggle's full potential. Today, the Yellow Jacket movement provides a case of an exemplary school. It is a window onto the economic and political situation of a large part of the popular masses of France–but also of its dominions, like la Réunion. It is, equally, a spotlight onto the ideological and political state of the progressive and revolutionary forces. They both have their importance. The Yellow Jacket movement, the edges at which it runs into its own insufficiencies and mistakes, but also its successes, are a mirror, a mirror on the state of the forces which constitute or which claim to constitute the camp of the people, a mirror on its own insufficiencies, its own shortcomings, of its own mistakes, but equally of its successes. We are watching the Yellow Jacket movement as an explosion of anger faced with a situation that has become unlivable by a large part of the popular classes, at the heart of which is found petty bourgeois elements, terrified by their declassment. This explosion of anger was not declared by the far right or by organized groups, although a certain number of organizations had a scent, some in order to build themselves off of it, even before the mobilization of November 7, and began to infiltrate the apparatus as embryonic leadership. These reactionary forces were on top in the beginning, but did not succeed in imposing their priorities, in particular racist priorities, due to the presence of immigrants and descendants of immigrants among the mobilized. However, their priorities pushed people away more than they attracted people. The infiltration attempts on the part of professional politicians have often been poorly perceived and have led to brutal reactions of rejection. There were isolated and spontaneous reactionary acts: racist, sexist, xenophobic acts, acts of violence were committed and highlighted by the media. On the other hand, fund raising for the unemployed, acts of mutual aid, occurred under silence. The proposed claims by the Yellow Jacket movement were the reflection of a new politics of those who wrote it, more than a plan sustained by an ideology. Reactionary claims, nurtured by far right propaganda, are present. They are the illustration of the influential power of ideologues of the reaction. On the other hand, other claims, even insufficient, denote the truly social aspect of the mobilization: higher salaries, which the rich pay, expanded democratic rights. These priorities are not political synthesized. And it is not done by the flick of the wrist. A large part of those in these mobilizations are doing their first protests, sometimes even at an advanced age. These are the individuals who have never participated in social or political struggles. Some liquidators of the social movements, standing on their arrogance, hold it against them. It can be legitimate, at the individual level, to adopt a view full of bitterness when you see these boards of Yellow Jackets, more numerous and determined than the protesters against the Loi Travail (labor reform of 2015 iirc). Individually, it's logical to think that. But the question isn't also asked from a militant point of view. It doesn't ask where you were. It asks what have we done for them to come. 'What have we done to bring a revolutionary political analysis beyond our militant bubbles? What are our faults,' and now what are theirs. We consider that the Yellow Jacket movement and its failures is, above all else, a mirror into our own failures. And our responsibility is total and complete. We hammer away this fact. We are the first responsible for our victories and our losses. We cannot criticize the bourgeoisie for following its interests, we cannot criticize the fascists for trying to takeover the leadership of the Yellow Jacket movement. We cannot criticize its ideological weakness. We can only see our own responsibility in the fact that the bourgeoisie is hegemonic. We can only see our failure in finding the means to prevent the fascists from being influential in this movement. Our task is not to complain about reality, but to find the strength, the energy, the means, and the path which allow us to pass from insignificant to significant, from inefficient to efficient, from isolated to hegemonic. If we don't have the forces, we have to understand why and remedy the problem. But we cannot wait for the bourgeoisie to dissolve itself or for the fascists to loosen its grip. However, we consider that by acknowledging these strengths and weakness, it is possible to progress, to improve the work we do, to improve our positions, and to fulfill our objectives. Self-criticism and criticism are ceaselessly announced as vital necessities. However, they are almost never applied. Oftentimes, pride, fear of showing errors in ones armor, are enough to make some organizations and individuals prefer to persist all the way to the end in their error rather than doing the work of repentance and admit their error. To hide this mistake, they latch onto grand general principles, full of absolute truths and constants. It's not enough to announce the grand principles borrows from purity to come here. It's not enough to be right 'in principle,' we must equally be right tactically and operationally to win. Engels wrote that 'Our doctrine is not a dogma, but a guide for action.' This conceptions is one of the foundations of Marxist thought, which is above all oriented in the goal of the revolutionary transformation of the world. It's to this transformation that we adhere, at the heart of l'Unité Communiste de Lyon. It's to this strategic objective of the transformation of the world, of putting the levers of power between the hands of the revolutionary proletariat that we subscribe. The tactics to accomplish this objective can be multiple, but must insert themselves and express themselves to continually advance towards its concretization. That requires a short parenthesis. A couple months ago in Lyon, there was a debate with a very well known member of a former far left organization from 80s and 90s, very strong proponent of direct action. We asked him a question, as well as to another panel member, who affirmed that her organization, hers being Italian, had made the Italian state change positions. We asked her what the strategy was to kick the bourgeoisie from power and to put it between the hands of the proletariat. The responses were confused. The question didn't seem to have crossed the minds of either of them. In both cases, they put forward theses on the romanticism of the struggle, on the necessity of being an example towards those who suffer exploitation and oppression. The beauty of the combat was placed above the concrete question of victory. On the libertarian media Rebellyon, we read this: 'we must not sacrifice our dreams or our imposed marginalization on the altar of efficiency. Let us not forget where we come from, even if we don't know where we are going — anywhere but to the renunciation of our values.' We will come back to this article. But already, what comes out initially is that the question of political engagement is around the fantasy, the values, the idea above the practice. In sum, it is a renunciation. We didn't construct the Unité Communiste de Lyon to wait for a revolutionary movement. We are not building it to create a warm and friendly club, but to conquer. The organization is, for us, a tool, not an end. The 'militant circle,' according to us, should serve the people, not itself. This utilitarianism can be shocking, but it is healthy and crucial. That brings us to a bitter conclusion, but nevertheless essential, fundamental, that of hegemony and the transformation of the world. If the marginality of a group needs capitalist society to live, if this way of life cannot become a way of life for humanity in its entirety, then this marginality is the cover for parasitism.

"Firstly, revisionism and market reforms are not synonymous, by any means. Lenin instituted the NEP. Khrushchev was a revisionist. There's an important difference not to be overlooked.

Some people say that its because the wrong person got into power, but to me that seems like a very simplistic explanation. It's not just simplistic, it's anti-Marxist. Individuals don't make history. I don't know if I support Deng though, when I saw the Cultural Revolution film 'How Yukong Moved the Mountains', it made me genuinely feel that a different world is possible, there was a genuine sense of community, not all of this narcism of modern society. It's sad to see all of that gone. I truly think it was the highest stage humanity has reached till now. But clearly there was a lot of backwardness too. The cultural revolution had lofty and far reaching goals. But the CCP learned that you have to stay in step with your material conditions. You can't just make full communism immediately. It takes time, and we shouldn't rush it. Problems happen when we do. Yes, the case of the USSR seems more complicated but over there too I think there were some other factors too.

"I don't think you can begin a post with 'I understand the why's and how's of Communism' and then ask a question like this, so please continue your reading. Communism functions on a planned economy. This means that instead of producing a vast surplus of goods, the labour is moved to another industry that needs it. You're making a big mistake in your logic, innovation and profit are totally separate concepts. The Soviet Union pioneered medical science, as well as launching the first person, animal, or object into orbit so to say innovation suffers is wrong. New businesses in capitalism exist to create profit not to innovate, and this is a LESS effecient system as Capital pools into the hands of the profitable, not the innovators. In a communist society its likely there would be time and labour devoted to innovation through research and development. If a citizen wanted to make something, it's likely there would be some kind of patent council to give them a chance to popularize the design. This is conjecture, but innovation flourishes under Communism. ",t3_a4zx26,communism

And Trotsky’s international stance was far more active as he wanted world socialism unlike Stalin the paranoid demagogue who cared more for his deific status in his own country than the proletariats. Trotsky’s ideological stance was that of the proletariat dictatorship Marx envisioned where the entire proletariat ruled collectively through local workers councils rather than the best few as Lenin envisioned it and the demagogue as Stalin did, he was more of a Marxist Lenin or Stalin and arguing otherwise is buying into Stalin’s propaganda.",t3_9pwrla,communism

It merely points out that revolution in the west before the fall of imperialism is impossible. There's still a lot of work to do and there's a few ML orgs in the west that do good work from that angle. Funding and providing refuge for third world revolutionaries, foreign exchange programs, forcing western countries to spend billions of dollars on police and national guard/gendarmerie to deal with domestic leftist activities, providing safe spaces for persecuted minorities and indigenous people, protecting indigenous land in the US from the US government and so on and so forth. I'm a US citizen, I'm also indigenous so trust me I'd love nothing more than to think I could grab a microphone and a rifle and overthrow the US government but the sad truth is the majority of the white people and a significant minority of the black population (ignoring non-slave groups like Somalis) benefit too much from imperialism to ever develop the material want for revolution and on top of that racism (especially orientalism) keeps those people from even having a moral want to stop their ruthless exploitation of the third world.

"I think he's alluding to the limits of Democratic Socialism. It seems to me that without a proper DotP, socialist leaders often find themselves in a highly precarious position (Salvador Allende, like he cited, but also Lumumba and many others). In fact, you can see this happening now with the South American DemSocs. Maduro's government is facing widespread acts of sabotage and violence by the Venezuelan bourgeoisie, including the burning of food/crops and lynchings of supporters and low-level officials (not to mention the US backed coups that threatened Chavez throughout his term). Counter revolutionary riots against Ortega in Nicaragua, and even the jailing of Lula in Brazil are also examples. It's kind of amazing that Morales has lasted so long TBH, but there are some material reasons for that IMO (his country doesn't have oil, for one...).

His notion of ideology is on par with the contemporary postmodern ideology: On one hand he denounces the liberal ideology of the western nation state (and he‘s right to do so), but on the other he demands a „liberating ideology“ to replace it. We see the same thing in the postmodern queer-theories and the related theories, that have their root in french post-modern Philosophy: Everything is a construct, and can merely be replaced by other constructs (=„deconstructed“), but never destructed i.e. overcome, because they deny the very existence of truth. But the goal of communism is to destruct all the constructs (to use the jargon of postmodernism), not to simply replace them with other constructs. Or, returning to the original point: To critique ideological thinkingi, because it is false thinking, which is necessitated by the false society, ruled by capital.

"They don’t fit at all. Fascism is the end stage of capitalism which only arises when the bourgeois dictatorship is seriously threatened by the working class. Examples of fascism in history always occur in countries where socialism is a major force.

Chilean fascist Pinochet only seized power when socialist president, Salvador Allende, began implementing democratic planning of the economy. Francisco Franco was fought by both Marxist-Leninists and Anarchists in the Spanish civil war. The situation in China is entirely different. Whether you think the CPC is socialist or not, they are extremely popular among the Chinese people for improving the economy and also as a result of their revolutionary heritage. They don’t fit the same conditions as the fascist countries in history. ",t3_a8pmiy,communism

"The Yellow Jacket movement and its implications caused a wave of shock among militant circles, circles which would be perceived from the outside as relatively homogeneous on the question of social movements. Certainly, the question of unions and leadership comes back to several positions at the heart of the far left, but it has to do with debates of order and tactics. In the context of the question of Yellow Jackets, antagonistic positions are expressed faced with a mass movement which is in for the long haul. Certainly, the suburban riots had crystallized the debates, with positions condemning the violence, others welcoming the militant struggle, but the reason for the anger were the object of a consensus. Today, it's more the very foundation of mobilization and the foundation of spontaneous mass movements themselves which are put under scrutiny by these claims. There exists a relatively small group of organizations which took the position to support the movement without any critique and to embrace it in its entirety. ___ I apologize, I'm out of mental juice. The gist of the rest is in the beginning of the article. Here's where I left off, if anyone is interested in continuing. Il existe un groupe relativement restreint d’organisations qui ont pris la position de soutenir sans la moindre critique ce mouvement et de l’embrasser dans son ensemble. Cette poignée d’indécrottables spontanéistes voit dans tout ce qui bouge une révolution prolétarienne qu’il ne faut que diriger sur la voie de l’insurrection. Chemin faisant, ceux-ci et celles-ci agissent en brûlant les étapes, en niant la lutte politique intérieur, niant la nécessité de politiser la mobilisation…en rejetant même cette question de la politisation, qui pourrait nuire à « l’unité du mouvement ». Le POI, l’organisation Trotskiste-Lambertiste, est de ceux-ci. Ils se mettent à la remorque du mouvement spontané, sans jamais défendre autre chose que l’opportunisme. D’un autre côté, une fascination acritique est née, voyant ce mouvement comme une pure émanation d’esprit prolétarien, comme quelque chose de pur, de cristallin. Le chaos sur les Champs-Elysées a réveillé les thèses spontanéistes du mouvement autonome ou de certains s’inscrivant dans une vision difforme et frelatée de la pensée Mao. Dans chacune de nos publications à destination des Gilets Jaunes, nous avons alerté sur la question de la présence d’opportunistes qui veulent transformer la colère en voix électorale. Nous avons averti également de la question de l’extrême-droite et pointé la nécessité que les revendications trouvent une synthèse politique. Cela nous paraissait essentiel, car nous ne pouvons nier ce mouvement, il nous faut donc défendre notre ligne. A l’inverse un certain nombre d’organisations ont choisi d’ignorer le mouvement et de ne défendre aucune ligne. Il s’agit à notre sens de la position la plus inconséquente possible et imaginable, surtout lorsque provenant de communistes ou d’individus se revendiquant communistes. Il s’agit d’une position liquidatrice qui ne fait qu’espérer que les choses se tassent, qu’elles rentrent dans l’ordre, que les individus repartent chez eux. Tout cela pour ensuite reprendre leur ordre du jour routinier et habituel sans en avoir tiré la moindre conclusion. Leur « analyse » a été au mieux incomplète, erronée. Au pire, inexistante, quasiment bergsonienne, faisant triompher l’intuition sur l’intelligence et l’analyse. Pour accompagner cette position, ils et elles ont pioché dans tout ce qui pouvait les arranger, au mépris de la réalité. En fait de travail d’enquête, ils ont agi en réactionnaires. Pour un peu, on pourrait facilement leur adosser les propos de Lorànt Deutsch « si on peut tendre vers le fait scientifique, tant mieux, surtout si ça accrédite ma chapelle, et ce que je pense, mon éclairage de l’histoire. Pour moi, la vérité historique, elle est dans un éclairage. » [Les Affranchis, France Inter, 10 juillet 2012.] « Qui n’a pas mené d’enquête n’a pas droit à la parole » écrivait Mao Zedong. A raison. Ce travail d’enquête est le seul qui peut permettre de déboucher sur le fait d’émettre une ligne juste. Nous considérons que nous avons le devoir d’avoir une ligne, même sous la forme d’une ébauche, par rapport à l’ensemble des débats qui agitent la société. Même si cette ligne est de dire que nous n’avons pas encore les éléments pour juger. C’est le travail d’une organisation communiste de faire cela, de fournir des points de repères et des analyses sur les luttes. On ne peut pas boycotter les luttes. Mais une ligne ne suffit par, il faut également une action affirmative envers ces faits de société. Les soutenir, les condamner, et avoir une pratique envers ce fait, cet événement ce phénomène. Là, une nouvelle fois, parmi ceux et celles qui condamnent en bloc le mouvement des gilets jaunes, qui le mettent à l’index, réside une question. Certains ont pu dire « ce sont les manifestations de l’extrême-droite, nous les chassons de nos cortèges, nous n’allons pas dans les leurs ». Cette position nous a paru le comble du paradoxe. De deux choses l’une, soit ce mouvement est irrémédiablement réactionnaire, tout comme pouvait l’être la Manif pour Tous, et dans quel cas, il devrait être attaqué, ses cortèges dispersés…etc. Soit il ne l’est pas intégralement, mais alors dans ce cas une politique doit être menée pour mener la lutte de ligne et -au minimum- en détacher les éléments les plus avancés et les moins réactionnaires. Dans tout les cas, cela implique une action. Or, nous notons que rien n’a été entrepris parmi les contradicteurs les plus véhéments pour donner un début de concrétisation à leur analyse. Et pour cause, nous pensons qu’ils ont été hypnotisés par l’irruption de quelque chose qui leur était complètement étranger : les masses populaires dans leur variété, dans leur force, mais également dans leurs faiblesses. Et face à cela ces organisations, ces individus, ont capitulé.",t3_a34zcu,communism

"Correlation does not equal causation. Most places where revolutions have occurred are in countries that don't get the benefit of colonialism or imperialism, or were on the receiving end of said wealth extraction. Of course they won't be able to expend much on education, because A. there's hardly any wealth left for those countries to spend on their own development B. to the sold-out politicians there, education would lead to opposition to their treason. It's a side effect. Imperial Russia took part in the First World War's fight over colonial possessions, and continued fighting even when its' soldiers no longer had sufficient clothing, food, or arms. Millions of Russian soldiers, and millions of Russian civilians died. So we had the liberal revolution where the Provisional Government was setup, and despite their complaints to the Tsarists over the war, they changed nothing. They refused to stop fighting and to provide relief to the ailing masses. So the Bolsheviks started their own revolution, put an end to the war, and during and after the civil war began work on rebuilding Russia (and later the Soviet Union). Poor education wasn't to blame for the Bolshevik Revolution - the greed and supreme disconcern of capitalists and their politicians for the workers and farmers was. Cuba, Nicaragua -- both have been victims of US corporate hegemony which had underpaid, brutalized, and murdered the working class and corrupted even more the bourgeois politics there. If you and your family are being beaten by bought-off police forces daily, you are hardly paid enough to feed yourselves, and there's no social programs for the poor - of course you're going to turn to the ideologies that have a solution for that. The 'dictators' you are so critical of are never the ones set up as puppets by Western imperial interests for some reason, but instead the leaders which have to maintain a strong hand to keep out imperial influence. Westerners seem unable to comprehend this for some reason.",t3_a4ipqw,communism

"Yes, I am Yugoslav. Parenti, from what I've seen, looks at the situation too black and white. And the Balkans are never black and white. He doesn't seem to care about the fact that Milošević was supported by the West until the nineties. And he fails to see his nationalism. He paints the Bosniaks to seem like some fascist monsters. I'm trying to find the links to some sources rn, but sadly there aren't many Yugoslav leftists that publish about the war. Milošević, Tuđman, Izetbegović, Karadžić, etc. all were nationalists, some were fascists, some not so much. But Milošević, at best, stood by as fascist Serbs gained power and planned a genocide. Reoublika Srpska was formed on the basis that they would be able to get Serb areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina united and ethnically cleansed of Bosniaks so they could unite with Serbia. Milošević materially supprted them at the start, and still supported them two years into the war. As for before the war, he was the first politician to publicly address a nation's struggle against enemies instead of the working class. Many of things the West claims he did are not true or are exxagerated, but just because he opposed America does not mean he was good. He was at the very least, a nationalist who stood by as genocide by RS was committed, and at worst, he helped the genocide be committed.",t3_a5jnxs,communism

"Really? Yes really. Who was responsible for building everything? Men. Because women were forced into a domestic role (which, incidentally, also included some building tasks for most of history). Apart from the brute force needed to carry raw materials, there's little that makes men better builders. What motivated to do that? The prospect of getting a wife. Hmmm. And here I was, thinking that humans generally want to feel useful and increase their environment and community. If men don't get to have any female partner, do you actually think they will be motivated to do any jobs? Uhm, yeah. I mean, sex is fun and I encourage people to have it, but it's only one motivator among many. You realize your argument also implies that women and gay men can't be motivated to do anything, right? Obviously climate change is a problem, that doesn't mean that nothing else can be a problem. Not what I said and I'm still wondering how third wave feminism is destroying the world. Let me spell them out: women only find a small group of top males attractive. Go look at the okcupid study. Only the top 20% of men were found to be attractive by all women. I can't actually easily find the study, only reactions to it. Which is alright, because reactions to a study like this always point out the flaws. Of which there were many in this study. Things like: 1. Shoddy methodology 2. Lack of alternative interpretations of the data 3. Ignoring that OKCupid isn't the way in which most people find a partner. 4. Ignoring the way people actually use the ratings on OKCupid. So if they had total sexual freedom, what would end up happening is that the majority of males on earth would get 0 female attention. The study was **only** about first-impression facial attractiveness. You can't come to your extreme conclusion based on only that. It was the patriarchy that ensured this catastrophe would not be reached: through mechanisms such as marriage, slut-shaming, and the family unit, patriarchy ensured 1 man for every 1 woman, and so everybody was happy. The women weren't happy. Nor were men that didn't fit in a hetero-normative, toxic masculinity based society. What you want to say is: I think I would be happy in a society that tailored to me. . But now, it is only the top males monopolizing all the women with casual sex. I *really* doubt I'm in the top 20% of men, and I know for a fact multiple women (and men, but that's less relevant) are attracted to me. What we also see in polyamorous spaces is that *everyone* has more sexual and romantic connections, regardless of gender or relative attractiveness. More sexual freedom benefits everyone who doesn't feel entitled to sex because they were born male. So it is no wonder that since 3rd wave feminism became the name of the game and women got more spots in colleges and were more accommodated and given preference for high paying jobs, women in the west no longer need a male partner, so they are free to go on tinder and have casual hook up after hook up with top tier males much above their own level of looks who will never stay with them past a hook up. Oh no, women were no longer required to deal with domestic abuse out of fear of financial ruin! What a terrible development. Have you considered that people actually like sex and romance? This is actually not causing women to be any happier: what they desperately want is an actual long term partner, but because they have sexual freedom, they are not able to control their biology and thus will make the mistake of going with the better looking man every time, and getting pumped and dumped over and over again. **No-one** is happy. Not due to increased sexual liberation, but because capitalism is sucking all the joy and wonder out of our lives. In fact, in the DDR, women had more sexual freedom than women in West Germany at the time, and they were also happier *and* had more orgasms. The problem isn't sexual freedom, the problem is capitalism making it impossible to actually enjoy things. You're also missing an obvious solution here: A woman could look for a guy for a long-term relationship, and keeping that relationship open for hook-ups. Best of both worlds. Women do not have the power to curb their own biology. That is why patriarchy was implemented and did it for them. 1. Neither do men, but you're not forcing them into undesirable behaviors. Maybe the 80% of 'unattractive men' need to suck it up? 2. The patriarchy wasn't implemented like it's a rational policy decision. Men forced it onto women and gender-non-conforming folks because they were worried about property inheritance. They didn't care about any of the things you're talking about. 3. You understand you sound like those people who go: Sure, capitalism isn't perfect, but it brought us here, so it must be working. Now, it is 2018, we have at least some remnants of patriarchy which have so far prevented this from being a catastrophe, but with EVERY PASSING year, there are more and more women who become like this. I genuinely still don't understand what catastrophe you're talking about. In about 10 years or so it will climax and the shit will hit the fan. That is what I mean by Western society will be destroyed. What? And how? At least make a prediction that actually says something.",t3_a2gbet,communism

"I can offer a Marxist-Leninist perspective: Selected highlights from Lenin’s : >“Mastery of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism requires serious and thoughtful study and, consequently, much work and time. What are the fruits of such a study? >Put briefly, the answer is that it gives us an integral world outlook, the most progressive outlook of our time, one in which the cardinal components of the great teaching of Marx and Lenin are blended in a harmonious, integral system. >There are various kinds of world outlook, whether progressive or reactionary. Some of the latter are based on ancient beliefs and superstitions and seek to persuade religious-minded people that they must remain blindly dependent upon some supernatural being and his vicars and anointed regents on earth. Other philosophies, while not openly asserting the existence of a deity and even avowing faith in “science” resort to subtle but false arguments in an effort to destroy man’s conviction of the real existence of the material world. >That is the method used by the exponents of the most fashionable trends in modern idealism. Many of them do not themselves believe in the existence of supernatural forces but, influenced by the traditional conventions and prejudices of bourgeois society, are unwilling to close all doors against belief in the supernatural. New discoveries in science, they say, cast doubt on the materiality of nature. And the theologians and clerics support them, on the assumption that people who can be induced to believe in the non-materiality of nature are capable of believing anything. >Not everything that imitates science is real science, just as not everything that glitters is gold. And particularly in our time many varieties of idealist philosophy eagerly assume a scientific guise in order to conceal their anti-scientific substance. In reality, they fear the weighty evidence of scientific facts and seek to hush up or distort these fact. >Marxism-Leninism has great merits that distinguish it from all other philosophical systems. >It does not recognize the existence of any supernatural forces or creators. It rests squarely on reality, on the real world in which we live. It liberates mankind, once and for all, from superstition and age-old spiritual bondage. It encourages independent, free and consistent thought. >Marxism-Leninism regards the world as it actually is, without adding an invented hell or paradise. It proceeds from the fact that all nature, including man himself, consist of matter with its different properties. >Nature, as well as all its individual phenomena, is in constant process of development. The laws of that development have not been ordained by God and do not depend on man’s will. They are intrinsic in nature itself and are fully knowable. There are no inherently unknowable things in the world; there are only things which are still unknown, but which man will increasingly get to know.” >– Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Manual; Second Edition, Foreign Languages Publishing House Moscow 1963, pages 15-16. Can a Marxist-Leninist be religious? Yup. Is it a contradiction? For a dialectical materialist, a Marxist-Leninist, yes, it's a contradiction.

"I’ll respond to the second part first: I’m not sure if I came off clear in my above comment, but I was trying to say that unregulated capitalism is BAD. I agree. THAT was the problem with the Guilded Age. It was essentially corporatism where powerful corporations were pulling the strings and making governments work to their advantages. The corporations were doing the oppression and they used the government as a means to do that. You are totally right that authoritarian oppression can occur without a “government”. If a corporation takes over and starts telling us what to do...it’s not any different than an authoritarian government. At that point they might as well be the same thing, and I would classify that system as corporatism...not a libertarian / anarchist society. When I say that there is not a threat of force in an anarchist system, I’m saying that no one has enough influence to really enforce that you do anything with consistency. At any point if there becomes a single person or entity that can exercise power of you with consistency...then it’s not really anarchism anymore in my opinion. It’s scary when anyone can exercise power over you, but it’s probably necessary. As citizens we just have to keep the authority in check. That’s what it as all about. Whether that be keeping corporations in check or actual governments in check. We should be skeptical of all authority of any type whether that be government or a non government entity. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t grant them some authority, but we have to make sure as a democracy we in the end still have the ultimate authority.

"It's hard to say with Nazism and Fascism, since although these ideologies are far-right, they aren't necessarily always conservative. Many Nazis, for example, are very anti-religion, despite religion being very traditional and conservative. To these ideologies, what stands above all is loyalty to the nation (or in the case of Nazis, the Aryan race), and by extension, the party in question which (in their eyes) represents the interests of the nation. This being considered, a very common idea among the far-right supporters is that we should return to the way things were, since that's when, as they believe, everything was right. And since Fascist groups (and especially Nazi groups) tend to be very populist, it's not abnormal for them to adopt this idea. This being said, don't think that just because a Fascist is against something we should be in favor of it. Most of what they say is simply reactionary, yes, but we should always be sure to analyze it ourselves before forming an opinion on the matter. It may very well be that something that we they say is degenerate is truly a symptom of the decadence of Capitalism. For example, many Fascists would consider the excessive consumerism and commercialization of their culture to be degenerate, something that I'm pretty sure most of us can agree on, just that our reasoning is much different from theirs.",t3_a5scwf,communism

"If by the siege mentality you mean, conspiracy theories (eg the Jews control the world etc, 'yahoodi sazish' etc), as someone from that geographical area, I can attest that those POVs are much too common. Interestingly enough, to me it seems that they are held more commonly by more 'educated' people (teachers, professors, bureaucrats, white collar workers), I heard someone say once that such conspiracy theories are a poor form of a proper materialist analysis. I think there is a lot of truth in that. People know in their guts that something is fundamentally wrong with society, especially in the areas that you mentioned, constant war and carnage, widespread poverty, the legacy of 300 years of colonialism, constant coups, assassinations of leaders, imperialist meddling etc. But what they learn in school is the complete opposite, (ie superiority of 'Islamic Civilisation', Communism was bad etc). Thus the only way they can reconcile the present state of affairs with the lofty ideals is by thinking of a grand conspiracy. Consequently most people think that there is a vile conspiracy afoot, and to be honest they are right in a way. I think J Sakai describes this way of thinking perfectly: >'Life in capitalist society makes a belief in conspiracies only rational, since we know that there are multiple layers of secret and illicit decision-making all around us reaching high up to the thrones of power. From the drug dealers paying off the police to the mafia garbage removal contracts to the Enronization of natural gas prices by the Bush clubhouse to those never-solved assassinations of so many trade unionists and journalists in the Southern Hemisphere to… It runs on without end, since by its basic soiled nature capitalism=conspiracy. >But there are several big problems with being obsessed with these political fantasies. Or believing that conspiracy theories are politics.'  It's the lack of an alternative theoretical framework, and to be honest where will people get one anyway? Most people are illiterate and anything of substance is in English anyway. Also I think it's a function of the petty bourgeoise class instinct, since these are the people who are the most invested in the ruling ideas of the ruling classes and thus are the most reactionary. To go against these ideas would be to commit class suicide.",t3_a6706r,communism

"I agree with you, although taken to an extreme every country has had an incomplete bourgeois national revolution except France. Spain is underdeveloped for the reasons you point out but Italy is equally divided between North and South. Even Britain, once the leader of world imperialism, is falling apart into national divisions and America will soon go the same way as its multi-national empire falls apart. For Lenin's purpose, the comparison is good enough, since these states which are still the first world despite being junior partners to imperialism are leagues different than the Russian empire, where the right of nations to self-determination was far more immediately connected to the proletarian revolution. I welcome your correction though since you're right about Spain. It's so backwards that Portugal exists rather than being part of a union like the UK or absorbed into the nation as in the various French kingdoms, which led to similarly backwards empires and eventually backwards semi-fascist compromises among the ruling class which were closer to Argentina or South Korea than Western European social democratic imperialism.

"The collapse of the Spanish nation is a modern phenomenon. In Lenin's time Spain was still an imperialist power and still retained the legacy of absolutist national unification under Philip V. By the time Lenin was an adult Spain had lost or was about to lose its last colonies, and in any case it was already an extremely weak imperialist state. Regardless of that I think it's wrong to call its earlier imperial phase a 'national unification', it was only an imperial unification. Spain has never been an homogeneous nation-state, and what almost completely collapsed was an empire which was multi-national (as all empires are!). The fact that it was an early empire, and a successful one at that, sort of prevented it from becoming a unified nation-state. It's never had a victorious progressive bourgeois revolution (there were at least three honest attempts, the last one being the closest one to succeeding), and the second half of the xx century can be seen at best as a passive bourgeois revolution imposed by genocide and fear. Still, though, the national question remained unsolved by the nature and logic of that political process. XXI century Spain still has not solved its national question, as can be seen in the current political environment.",t3_a9zo4p,communism

So, you can participate in your own, non-commercialist way. Ask yourself, what do your family members value? Is there a non-commercial alternative or duplicate of this value? Do I have any abilities (unskilled or skilled) that can create this value? (That card suggestion is an example). And, these valuable things need not be material -- they can be symbolic things like expressions, interactions, experiences, etc. etc. My grandmother, for example, places more value in sharing experiences and forging memories with me than she does receiving a gift.

"It's just idle speculation not based on any real study of reality. In fact reality is blocked from study by ideology since the conclusion has already been determined by moral concerns. Besides that, the statement cannot be responded to since it is just a series of tautologies. 'Created,' 'socialist economic order,' and 'government' are defined and redefined so that one can never disprove them because of the complexity of reality. It's not a question of politics, just logic, and that kind of statement which defines almost all socialist forms of idealism is what Wittgenstein called 'pseudo-problems.' Marxism-Leninism on the other hand has a very clear set of premises, predictions, scientific method, and correspondence to reality. That is why it is the target of such speculation by those unsatisfied with the contradictions of reality but without a real material interest in solving them. >What is important is not that governments have decided to concede certain rights to the people, but the reason why they had to do this. Of course, if one accepts Lenin's cynical phrase and thinks of freedom merely as a 'bourgeois prejudice', then, to be sure, political rights have no value at all for the workers. But then the countless struggles of the past, all the revolts and revolutions to which we owe these rights, are also without value. To proclaim this bit of wisdom it hardly was necessary to overthrow Tzarism, for even the censorship of Nicholas II would certainly have had no objection to the designation of freedom as a bourgeois prejudice. Notice here that Lenin's original statement: >Freedom is a bourgeois prejudice. We repudiate all morality which proceeds from supernatural ideas or ideas which are outside the class conception. In our opinion, morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of the class war. Everything is moral which is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting order and for the uniting the proletariat. Our morality consists solely in close discipline and conscious warfare against the exploiters Which is simply a statement of fact, is turned into a moral category. But it is still muddled since the initial claim that rights are won through struggle is just a repetition of Lenin's point. It then is turned into a question of 'value' while the two are brought together by a complete non-sequitor since Lenin's quote has nothing to do with the 'value' of Tzarism and is merely a thesis on the origins of moral thought in idealism and secularized religion.. Remember that Nietzsche diagnosed the socialism of his time as primarily moral (what became the SPD) and this has only become more true as western and eastern socialism have increasingly diverged by the material consequences of imperialism.",t3_a49nnd,communism

">Isn't orthodox Marxism inherently unmarxist. By orthodox marxism I meant to say 'classical' marxism, the actual thought of Marx himself, but I agree that it is counterproductive to fight one another over minor dogmatic issues. Marx's analysis is extremely lucid for his time and I belive he's one of the few philosophers that deserve being studied, even if you don't agree with any of his political ideas. Historically anyway the revolutionary movement took an unexpected turn with the October revolution in Russia: Marx expected the revolution to start from an industrialized country like Germany or England, and so did most of the Bolsheviks, so they had to improvise. So should we consider anything that started from here as a deviation from 'pure' marxism (Leninism, Maoism, etc)? In my opinion, it's very hard to foresee a world revolution starting in the next few years and so it was in the 20th century to have a successfull complete proletarian world revolution, so I think Marx **must** have considered the possibility that things may have not turned out to be has he expected.

">The revolutionary struggles for decolonization and women’s liberation will not wait until the struggle for a vulgar “socialism” is declared complete by a so-called “dictatorship of the proletariat” in the first world (really nothing but a dictatorship of white men) This is really just logically silly as sympathetic as I am. It's clear that the author sees socialism as an *ideal* juxtaposed to the existing social conditions, instead of the real movement of the proletariat, i.e. the proletariat becoming conscious of itself. It is precisely the universality of the proletarian subject which makes the idea of subliminally racist socialism absurd. And yet the author uses the term 'vulgar socialism', when the historical usage of the term 'vulgar' implied the mechanistic *distortion* of historical materialism by Bernstein and eventually Kautsky and Plekhanov. What was the meaning of this distortion? It was the ideology of labor lieutenants of the imperialist bourgeoisie, who sought to chain the proletariat to their masters, and to deny the historical necessity of the Russian Revolution. That is to say, to demoralize the proletariat and to overthrow socialism - not construct it. Zak Cope plays with the idea by painting the Nazis as petty-bourgeois socialists. It's an invaluable work for its empirical evidence on the class composition of German fascism, but I think that characterization misses the point. Socialism is an objectively distinctive mode of production, which fascism is *a reaction to*. On an irrelevant side note, I also think people who call the DSA 'strasserists' as opposed to just *opportunists* miss the point here: the Nazis only called themselves 'socialism' because of the diffusion of Marxism amongst the masses. What the author calls 'the dictatorship of white men' *already exists*, and it is in fact the dictatorship of capital. The foundation of this dictatorship isn't its ephemeral cultural manifestations, it's the super-profits wrung by paying Azanian gold miners below the value of their labor-power. >Humanity is on the brink of our own extinction and these men pretending to be “Communists” as they abuse women and ignore violence against us are shamelessly destroying our only real chance for survival. This just shows how utterly unserious this person is. They have totally failed to grasp historical materialism and, consequently, the real role of the individual in history. But this isn't a problem of them simply not understanding Marx; it is the reflection of the inflated ego of a petty-bourgeois. Revolutions are not *made* where the victory of communism is premised upon an irrelevant handful of students possessing the correct slogans. You live in Babylon, not Nepal, so you get the leaders you deserve. But the actual article contains within it no proof that the 'leadership' of the PSL is guilty. I feel as if I'm subject to the eternal occurrence of teenagers using Marxism as a vehicle for self-promotion on social-media, treating parties and 'tendencies' as if they were clothing. And, given that this self-promotion is really a class reproduction strategy under neoliberalism, it's not a new trend. ",t3_aazman,communism

"i've found a few articles related to how the cpc is responding to this issue and highlighted relevant parts for easier reading. Most migrant workers are loosely connected with local branches of the Communist Party of China (CPC) where they grew up, but natives of Gushi in their nation's capital are represented by the Working Committee sent by Gushi County Committee of the CPC to Beijing -- the Party's first such organization for migrant workers in their new cities. **This outpost in Beijing has helped migrant workers from Gushi handle 109 labor disputes and 680 other legal cases, and retrieved 47.6 million yuan (about 7.15 million U.S. Dollars) in unpaid wages.** The pilot project showcases the Party's resolution to ensure China's floating population are not left adrift in their adopted homes. Miao Zhenshui, a retired military officer who has led the working committee since 2008, has been named one of the year's 100 best Party workers and will attend an award ceremony on July 1, the 95th anniversary of the Party's establishment. **'Party building among the transient population is a challenge for the CPC. My team is just exploring what improvements we can make at the local level to better serve the country's 270 million migrant workers,' said Miao.** ... 'All branch leaders understand what it is like to be a migrant worker and this motivates us to help,' said Miao. >... **Migrant workers are usually poor and lack legal knowledge. To remedy the situation, Miao has assigned commissaries to each Party branch to disseminate economic information and offer legal advice.** **Lawyer Wang Junlin, who provides legal assistance to migrant workers at the request of the working committee, has become accustomed to getting late-night calls from Miao or the 32 branch chiefs. These Party workers provide 24/7 services to the Gushi migrants.** [lots of examples and anecdotes that i'm leaving out for brevity, check out the link] *  (2016) **The State Council, China's cabinet, has started overhaul of measures to protect the rights and interests of migrant workers.** **The items under review include employment, entrepreneurship, labor rights, urban public services and permanent urban residence status, according to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.** Six teams have been dispatched to Anhui, Chongqing, Fujian, Gansu,Guangdong and Liaoning. The inspection is divided into two phases -- self-inspection and field supervision. Local governments must rectify problems found during the inspection. *  (2017) **China is encouraging migrant workers to return home and start their own businesses amid efforts to spur rural development and reduce poverty.** >... **This came after the country announced a strategy to make its rural areas more prosperous, as designated in the No. 1 central document of 2018.** Hoping for a better life, millions of young rural laborers have left their hometowns to work in cities, leaving old people and children in the villages. The return of skilled and experienced migrant workers can help promote social and economic development in rural areas and ultimately invigorate rural development, said Zhang Deyong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank. **Last month, the NDRC released a plan ordering local authorities, commercial banks and financing guarantee firms to expand financial support for returned migrant workers who start their own businesses.** >**More than 7 million migrant workers have returned to their hometowns to start their own businesses,** and each new entrepreneur helps boost local employment by providing jobs for about four people on average, according to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security *  (2018) **China will provide more legal assistance for migrant workers and the disabled, according to a statement released by the Ministry of Justice.** Authorities must make more efforts to promote law awareness to prevent and reduce disputes over migrant workers' labor rights and interests, the statement said. **The ministry said that legal assistance must be accessible to all migrant workers, to ensure that by 2020, no migrant workers will have their wage payment delayed, a major dispute between migrant workers and employers at present.** **The statement also requires legal assistance personnel to provide door-to-door services to the disabled and offer convenient communication channels through messaging-app WeChat.** **The ministry said it will advance the legal aid work as a national campaign and had selected 12 cities and districts as demonstration sites for the work.** *  (2018) ",t3_a3s0r1,communism

"How did the person with 50 million earn the 50 million? Did they get it by working as part of a salary? If so what was the nature of the work that the salary provided? Who or what rules governed the actions of that work? Or Did they get it by owning wealth. IE did they get it as stock dividends or rent or profit sharing? Or as a salary that they themselves drew from a company or other organization that they own? The progressive tax system is a compromise that was established in previous crises of capitalism that the capitalist owning class conceded to prevent revolution. The only reason the labor aristocracy and petty bourgeois now see it as 'morally wrong to tax' is because billionaires are shoveling loads of money into propaganda to convince you to give that concession back because they have almost no where on earth left to expand into and the only thing keeping them on top is a system that has had to have mountains of debt dumped on it for decades. The truth is the people who get 50 million a year to be taxed at 50% (which is not actually the case at all in the first place, it's a strawman argument), are getting that much out of the wealth they own, not the work they do. They are already coercing it out of the laborers via the system of private property that they themselves enforce with brutal violence. Taxation isn't theft.

"Marriage is not a 'capitalist institution' you brainwashed thing. Marriage has been there prior to capitalism. You pseudo-communists only think in terms of left and right. That is NOT how it works. The political spectrum is more complex than that. Think of a QUADRANT, divided by a horizontal line and a vertical line, so basically like a large crosshair (that is used in FPS games). On the far LEFT of the horizontal line is communism, and on the far right of the horizontal line is laissez-fare capitalism. The horizontal line represents the ECONOMICAL orientation. Then we have the VERTICAL line, at the far top is authoritarianism, and on the bottom is libertarianism. So I would be in the top left of the quadrant, which means an authoritarian who is economically communist. But you guys think that it is just left and right, and you think being left means you have to be pro-3rd wave feminism and economically capitalist at the same time. No, that is not how it has to be. When we say communist we are only referring to the economic side of things. Unfortunately, most modern communists are libertarian (pro feminist). ",t3_a2gbet,communism

"'It would be easy for ethnic chauvinism to become law policy according to the democratic centralist model.' If you want a practical understanding of how that was struggled against through that model, I recommend the books The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939 (2001) by Terry Martin, and the collection A State of Nations: Empire and Nation-Making in the Age of Lenin and Stalin (2001) that he helped edit. 'It reduces diversity of opinion in the proletariat to just ideas, rather than bringing to attention the material basis for disagreement (race, gender, etc.)' It doesn't necessarily have to. Bringing up additional distinctions of social oppression can be brought into the model (or a variant), though it requires patience and real struggle (as it has in Cuba with LGBT rights). 'Forcing unity among people aren't fundamentally united requires more than just having the minority not talk about it. Unity is fostered, not imposed.' This is presuming real consensus is actually possible, and I know of no history or country where that has ever been achieved. Unity is made by agreeing that while politics are inherently competitive, you have to agree with fundamentals and not fight directly (but socially), and those who can prove the worth of their ideas or policies deserve real but temporary authority, and if reality disproves them, they will either fail or be replaced. After Lenin died, Stalin was not in power for half of a decade, and it took him a full decade to get to power by reworking the entire party (hundreds of thousands of the most ideologically advanced workers and union representatives), including the Central Committee, back to a Leninist line. The book The Great Urals: Regionalism and the Evolution of the Soviet System (1999) by James R. Harris provides the 'fairest' mainstream reading of that early struggle. If Mao saw handling contradictions as 'generally non-antagonistic' as best to achieve 'unity', and thought either was genuinely possible, then I'd like to see how he came to that conclusion, or how he justified the Cultural Revolution at all, given that it was profoundly antagonistic across intra-class and inter-class levels, at least if you compare it to Stalin's rise in the 1920s. 'but to reduce the solution to discipline' I would say party discipline periods are a regulation and mass debate periods are the solution. But even then, I'm talking about Soviet Russia exclusively. I am not against other countries trying other models. 'But the universality of the main principles in the abstract can and should be more of a guide' I think I was presuming a one-to-one correlation, but that makes more sense. 'By eliminating the bourgeoisie, you limit your potential for development (see Dengist reforms), but by granting the bourgeoisie political power, you risk the ultimate reversal of all your gains.' Maybe the Chinese just understood their history, as this is a point that Arrighi generally argues is what lead to the Century of Humiliation. While its production and trade was more advanced compared to its Western competitors, the progressive class of the time (the bourgeois) didn't even attempt to centralize itself as a class into the state while in Europe, this was a process that took centuries and ultimately took place in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to the rise of Colonial Europe and the fall of Imperial China. That historic defeat of the Chinese by a foreign bourgeois, and its horrific result, might have soured the petit-bourgeois class (obviously, with workers and peasant masses in clear agreement) to the idea that their bourgeois should ever be allowed a role in centralizing control over national policy (while their resources, skills, education, and management became clearly necessary to cultivate through the pitfalls of communal 'high wind' and 'exaggeration wind' production, and base equalization of wages and access to goods and services). 'He outlines the necessity for New Democracy.' And makes a convincing case for it in a couple paragraphs. But after skimming through this  a few days back (offered below in another thread), I just don't see where Lenin disagrees with any of that. This wasn't viable in the USSR because there, you had to divide people to achieve extensive and intensive production, and produce the surplus labor, surplus time, and surplus value (or value, as in wealth) to create a stable infrastructure that could give the majority of workers and peasants fair wage scaling and relative social expenditures ('welfare') while preparing them for war with fascism. As you've shown, Amin does sympathize with that perspective, and I just can't see New Democracy working in the USSR (winning over a large amount of proto-fascist Cadets and Whites while not collectivizing early and dividing the peasantry, and not using the resulting agricultural surplus to trade abroad for money that could pay off pre-1917 British debts and gain access to Anglo-American tools, resources, manuals, and advisors necessary for industrialization, but somehow also producing a world-historic agricultural surplus (and later military surplus), training and organizing tens of thousands of officers and millions of soldiers while also transporting millions from western Russia to safety in central and south-central Russia, trying to become effectively centralized and 'fully' industrialized by the time the Nazis invaded in 1941). 'They have always tolerated some local bourgeois presence, as they should.' I agree, and toleration is the right word to use. As I said, I don't feel confident enough to discuss dialectics or Korea in any detail. 'It says that ML is the right ideology for Russia, but not for Korea, because Korea is culturally distinct.' But don't they at least have broad similarities? That's what I was thinking about. I recently saw a Cuba thread where apparently their model of participatory democracy is heavily influenced by North Korea (though I have no sources on that). 'Detractors say that Juche is idealist and should mostly be rejected by serious Marxists.' Regardless if it is or not, I'm not in favor of leaving progressive nations in the Third World out of the anti-imperialist movement. A lot of people disagree with the way a country does things, then that 'radical opposition' slowly degenerates into CIA propaganda.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"The US strategy in downing that plane was simple: Force the Iranians to agree to a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war. The US pushed that war, which had the unforeseen consequence of uniting Iranians to back their theocratic gov't. The fact that both Iran and Iraq were desperate for money meant they both pumped oil like madmen and violated OPEC's oil limits which reduced oil prices for the US. But when the tide started to turn against Iraq, the US was eager for Iran to agree to a ceasefire. But the Iranians did not see the US logic in halting the war once they started winning. So the US backed everything from Iraq's chemical weapons program, to Bush's administration guaranteed $1+ billion in agricultural loans to Saddam Hussein's Iraq to feed the Iraqi people and army, to our re-flagging Iraqi oil tankers to fly the Kuwaiti flag with the US Navy escorting them out of the Persian Gulf.

"Sorry for the late reply ! I don't think it's fair to say that Stalin believed that the class struggle ceases under socialism. Look what he says here: >“Some comrades have grasped the fact of the destruction of the classes, the creation of a classless society, as the argument of the thesis of the weakening of the class struggle theory is a counter. These people can not have anything in common with our Party. They are renegades and hypocrites who must be expelled from the Party. Not achieve the elimination of classes with the weakening of the class struggle, but its amplification to the final annihilation of all other kinds of agony, and organizing to defend the country against capitalist encirclement is not to be annihilated.” Comrade Stalin’s Collected Works, Volume II, page 546.  In fact if you look at the internal politics of the Soviet Union it seems that Stalin was outnumbered by the revisionists. I mean Nikolai Voznesensky who was involved in the Leningrad Affair was the Chairman of GOSPLAN! He was also the Deputy Premier! It wasn't just Khrushchev as we discussed earlier the revisionists were everywhere! &#x200B; >I see it just as a difference of perspective. Lenin is looking at the ideal, saying the NEP is less ideal than without it. The CCP is looking at the immediate demands of the revolution. Personally I tend to think the latter is a more appropriate attitude to take, but that's not something I'd make a big deal out of. Lenin's attitude does seem a little more idealist (instead of materialist), but it's really quite minor, not something work making a fuss over. Why would you say Lenin's view was idealistic? >Well Khrushchev was from the countryside in Ukraine. I don't think that's meaningful in itself, though. Mao was from the countryside, and many others. As mentioned, the problem with the Soviet model for collectivization is that it broke the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. Khrushchev being from the countryside is insignificant, because, as we mentioned, revisionism had a material basis. The goal is to understand the material basis, rather than reducing it to people. Yes indeed, but still I think its interesting that Khrushchev was from the countryside. Perhaps the scars of collectivisation ran deep, but I have not read anything that argues this viewpoint though. &#x200B;",t3_a5uuwt,communism

"Hey, I think that there's a ton of misinformation on Mao and Stalin leftover from Cold War propaganda. Although there are very valid criticisms, I think disingenuous reporting and flat out lies have caused the image that they're evil baby eating dictators. I would say that they were definitely authoritarian so if you're more of a libertarian leftist, then I guess they're not for you. I mean ultimately, by the time Mao died in 1976, the lifespan of Chinese citizens doubled from 35 to 70, and China had been able to stand up for itself against foreign imperialists. China was without a doubt infinitely better off. In 1917, Russia was the most backwards country in Europe, unindustrialized and reliant on peasant labor and having lost WWI. By 1945, in less than 30 years, the Soviet Union had transformed itself into an industrial powerhouse, emerging from WWII, although devastated, as the second most powerful country in the world, able to fully challenge the West on all fronts. Countries like Britain industrialized over ~150 years, but the Soviet Union did it and surpassed the English in a matter of decades. I mean the two countries that experienced the most growth in the 20th century were the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Stalinism isn't really a thing, it's just a term used to make the USSR look bad. Their ideology was Marxism-Leninism, which argued that communist revolutions could take place outside of industrialized countries, but doing so would require a vanguard party that operates like a military and is able to exercise strong authority.  is one on the Russian Revolution.",t3_aav4pf,communism

He is personally perhaps the most capable man in the present C.C., but *he has displayed excessive self-assurance and shown excessive preoccupation with the purely administrative side of the work.*' As for being a 'thug', Stalin was never convicted of a felony during the Russian Empire period, it was only exciled for political crimes, and his political genius exceeded Trotsky's by far as history showed.

"The collapse of the Spanish nation is a modern phenomenon. In Lenin's time Spain was still an imperialist power and still retained the legacy of absolutist national unification under Philip V. Though the wheels had already been set in motion by its defeat by America and the backwardness of its imperialism and capitalist development, these wouldn't fully manifest until the civil war. Remember that nations are imagined communities founded in a concrete historical development and they can be unimagined.

Every nation needs to prioritize their own development such that they can build powerful anti-imperialist economies. 3) A proper materialist method of epistemology, where the sole criterion for truth is social practice.

"There is no ideological doctrine for punishment, we tend to think it isn't a very useful tool for accomplishing our ends, so understand this is some combination of practice and my own suggestions. It depends on how you would answer these questions: When your workplace (current or future) is run democratically, would you take violent action in opposition? When the whole economy is run democratically, would you take violent action in opposition? When the state is run democratically, would you take violent action in opposition? When all people are granted civil rights, would you take violent action in opposition? When the final victory of socialism has been achieved, would you attempt to rebuild or continue systematic oppression or discrimination? If you answered yes to any of these, odds are you would be sent to a re-education camp. Should your actions be particularly damaging/lethal and/or you show every intention of trying to kill more people, you would likely be executed. If you would not respond violently no-matter the social change, but would oppose the working class non-violently, you would probably have to take some mandatory re-education classes in your free time.

What do you mean Anti Material rifle? 5.56 is not an anti-material round. >Plus ARs are light Because they're made out of polymer/aluminum. Doesn't stop bubba from replacing the lost weight with unneeded garbage. >have almost unnoticeable recoil. Compared to 7.62x39, sure. 5.45? nah dude. the newer AKs have outpaced the AR/M-XX rifles by a wide margin. And outside of the US with their god awful import bans they're much more affordable and available. >I won't argue the M16 had lots of issues but the modern day AR-15/AR-18s run absolutely amazingly. The AR/M-XX rifles still have problems today. The problems with the old M16s was that the AKs were better in the jungle conditions in most ways. Which is why GIs would dump their M16s for vietcong AKs. The modern M16s/M4s aren't that much better. They're the same rifle with a few additions. Also the AR18 stopped production in the 80s. I wouldn't call a 50 year old rifle 'modern'. The 74 and AK 100/10X series rifles beat out the AR style rifles anyways in being a single rifle that someone can use daily in most if not all scenarios. The constant pushback is 'Well, I can swap out A,B,C part to make AR do X,Y,Z thing.' Which I'm just like cool, rifle already does that, because I train with it to know how to do things. The current AR user is basically just capitalist gun ideology. Gun doesn't do thing? Throw money at it until it does. On the other hand; AK doesn't do thing? It's because I haven't learned how to do thing with AK. Better go train and shoot rifle. With that said, I can still see the merit of each rifle. I just don't believe the AR is the best choice. People claim rifle is cheaper and better, but AR users end up spending hundreds on their rifle on gadgets and gizmos while I spend hundreds on range fees and ammo shooting rifle.

"That China is interested in Greek ports is well known. That they are creating political alliances with Greek fascists in order to suppress the labor movement is a conspiracy. As is the case with all conspiracies, it vastly overinflates our own importance as well as our enemies. The neoliberal SYRIZA government is perfectly capable of suppressing labor on behalf of international business, there is no need for fascists. Nor does capital need China to spur it to repress labor, it does that regardless. The left as well vastly overestimates its power, China most likely has no opinion at all of the Greek left in relation to its investment in Greek ports and sees this as a purely economic deal that it would make with PASOK, SYRIZA, and yes, probably Golden Dawn if it came to power (it would make similar deals with a KKE socialist state if it was still interested). Again, China's policy is straightforward and it has decided that it will no longer involve itself in the internal politics of other countries. That is one of the lessons it 'learned' from the collapse of the USSR. You do not have to agree but the conspiracy theories about China, which scream of small western leftist groups screaming 'notice me!' to the Chinese CCP, show me that it's probably correct. The KKE is more substantial of course but its opinion on China seems way less important to its party line than its position on imperialism today and NATO, that the OP had to dig for some blog reposting a newspaper article compared to the central questions on the KKE's own site shows both the relative value and the extremely warped perspective of western leftists who do not have an independent existence like the KKE and desperately wish to be in a dependent relationship to foreign communist parties as Maoist groups once were. The Philippines is different since China is relatively more influential and the persistence of the CCP is a central question for Maoist theory, but even then the amount of discussion about China through the CPI(M) in the west compared to the discussion of anything else (like for example the actual structure of the Filipino economy and regional uneven development) shows this is far closer to conspiracy thinking given the facade of a foreign voice than real concern for actual political possibilities.

There are religious communist movements such as liberation theology, but generally speaking religious institutions have shown the greatest disdain for human rights and rational governance. That anyone would promote theology disgusts me. Additionally, while the right of people to chose and follow their own faiths is important, there is not even the weakest rational or evidenced based reason to believe in deities and other such nonsense. It is all well and good to let people live as they please, but having a state act as though some kind of god or spirit exists to govern it is a fantastic way to oppress its citizens and drive the state to eternal conflict with the rest of the planet, as history has actually shown, unlike the fairy-tale you seem to live in.

"Sounds very similar to Maoist protracted peoples war.

Further we would want to create some sort of network between these communities to organize intercommunally, plan production, support each other (eg correct localized food shortages), etc. The communists would use methods such as democratic centralism and the mass line as tools to ensure the will of the people is followed and beaurocracy/abuse of authority is kept under control as much as possible Would that qualify as a justified hierarchy?

"Revolutions grow out of material conditions. Venezuela attempted to unite the nationalist bourgeois interests and the workers against the multinational corporations. However, the nationalist bourgeois turned its back on the workers and sided with the multinationals once the working class power became a threat to the power of the nationalists and attempted coups on Chavez and then Maduro. This forced them to move more towards their political support in the working class. While Venezuela certainly has a long path to follow, and the workers have not met the last challenge to their newfound dominance, communism doesn't just appear because we want it to. We first must have a revolutionary situation, then conscious leaders to push and organize the workers, who must decide for themselves what is good. Much like the existence of social welfare in the US doesn't make the US dominated by socialists, the existence of capital in Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, China, and the USSR (at any given point in its existence) doesn't make those countries dominated by capitalists. Therefore, forget what Maduro says he wants. It's a little like Obama saying he wants a public option. What's important is from what class he actually derives his power. If the workers can maintain their power, the contradiction between private property and workers will necessarily sort itself out in due course. If he derives his power from the bourgeois classes, then again, forget what he says he wants.",t3_a66ci9,communism

"Did Mao not read Stalin's  and reducing them to logistics. Presupposing the success of every potential revolution by appealing to a single success in China obscures the potential for disaster (Poland in the early 1920s, Afghanistan in the late 1970s) and greater geopolitical defeat. That critique seems less like Maoism and more like Trotskyism. I know it was written by a Bukharinite, but the book Soviet Fates and Lost Alternatives (2011) makes a fair case arguing it was mostly a contingency of factors that caused the Soviet dissolution. Deng preserving China was as much of a contingency as Gorbachev dissolving the Soviet Union. I hope Mao didn't see this as a meaningful divergence because it makes it seem like him and his followers took a fair criticism (a lack of participatory democracy as an instrument of centralizing class struggle) and have turned it into a secular religion. There's a reason modern China has millions participating in trade unions and labor congresses, but there's also a reason these are centralized by large federations connected to major industries and regulated by local leaders sent by the party (who are committed to party ideology rather than local concerns exclusively, and who are centrally appointed, but not locally elected in regulating these local issues). You could read Decentralized Authoritarianism in China (2008) by Pierre F. Landry or Contemporary Class in China (2014) by David S. G. Goodman if you want the closest thing to 'moderate' mainstream perspectives that reveal these relations fairly well. If China was purely committed to Maoism nowadays, I think it would be developing steadily (as it was in the 1970s, according to Joshua Eisenman's new book, Red China's Green Revolution), but it would not have the overall successful dynamic it has now (and I think that it has more roots in standard Marxism-Leninism), nor would it be the major force competing against the primary contradiction.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"There is a direct correlation between the rise of 3rd wave feminism and school shootings. 95%+ of school shooters are upset males because under 3rd wave feminism they have no chance to have their human right to having a partner/sex met. Same thing with terrorism, over 95% of foreign ISIS recruits fell under the same category. So if you put 2 and 2 together it is not easy to conclude that as 3rd wave feminism strengthens its choke-hold on society, these types of events will probably increase in frequency as well. Those are just some problems that 3rd wave feminism cause though. Depression has also positively correlated with 3rd wave feminism. Women are more miserable now, despite having more sexual freedom. They are more lonely: they have more casual sex with partners much better looking than themselves, but at the end of the day they feel lonely. More and more married women are cheating. More and more women are going into jobs that 3rd wave feminism brainwashed them to go into, such as corporate jobs or law, and they are finding that these jobs do not make them happy and that they should have just left these jobs to men. Women are becoming like men. They are no longer feminine. They are going against their own nature. In fact, western countries are dying off because of dangerously low birth rates.

As British workers we have to focus on what is happening in our own country and look for an alternative education to the one we are getting.” Sure Cuba is different.

"   There's a lot of very important work going on right now in materialist feminism. Even if materialist feminism as we understand it ends up being theoretically untenable, it's still incredibly worthwhile that women are analyzing our situation and our oppression through a materialist lens. There is, funnily enough, a lot of really great work unfolding on Twitter right now. A vanguard party does need to be able to navigate these subjects. In the US, we do not have one of those yet. We have a lot of organizations trying really hard (and unfortunately some cadre will dismiss problems because they are hopeful about their particular party becoming a vanguard), but none actually at that stage yet. What's going on in the PSL is pretty well summarized in the article, but I think a great degree of it is their misinterpretation (Trotskyist, Menshevik) of democratic centralism. , what we see is the democracy defined too narrowly and the centralism defined too broadly. As Mao said, 'Communists must listen attentively to the views of people outside the Party and let them have their say. If what they say is right, we ought to welcome it, and we should learn from their strong points; if it is wrong, we should let them finish what they are saying and then patiently explain things to them. A Communist must never be opinionated or domineering, or think that he is good in everything while others are good in nothing; he must never shut himself up in his little room, or brag and boast and lord it over others.'",t3_aazman,communism
"During the 1800s the main defender of the Monroe Doctrine was Britain which found it preferable to use the underdeveloped settler nation of America to keep its European rivals at bay than the danger of America growing into a rival. While Marx and the British working class movement were a major part in Britain's decision to not interfere in the American civil war, ultimately it was British capitalism which chose to allow America to grow into a unified capitalist nation and therefore sow the seeds of its own doom. As late as 1895, Britain and America almost went to war over South American borders, a fight Britain would have won. But eventually, the tables were flipped, and it was the United States which supported the British gold standard when a Britain no longer had the power to do so (and like China today, did so to make its exports relatively cheaper). Colonialism died with Britain and the Sterling based free trade and its replacement by neocolonialism represents an advance towards world socialism even though it seems further away than ever. We're now seeing imperialism outgrow America's ability to contain it, as the very institutions it created in the WTO, UN, and EU are being used against it. Does China represent a more advanced stage of capitalism (a larger, more populous nation with an immense productive base, a far more unitary political class and land reform legacy than the settler legacy of America, and the political legitimacy of third world national liberation and genuine respect for national self-determination) which will truly give the UN and WTO the political power they were supposed to have but immediately undermined by the reality of American cold war reaction and America's colonial legacy? Or does it represent the final collapse of imperialism and the rise of genuine national development for all the world's peoples on a socialist basis? This doesn't mean the end of the labor aristocracy, only socialism can bring that about. As Tony Norfield has correctly pointed out, the problem with analysis of 'Empire' as no longer tied to nation states is that the reality of contemporary financial imperialism is heavily reliant on first world national borders and the advantages of access to dollar markets and monopoly capital. Instead, a new kind of labor aristocracy is forming, one closely tied to finance and less tied to unions in the final manufacture of commodities for export. How large this will be I think can only be determined in the next great class struggle (it was not destined that London would become a center of eurodollar trade after the second world war, it could have easily gone the way of France instead) and what continuity there will be between previous labor aristocracy will be determined by national struggles. But it does point to something very different, as it's hard to imagine China with the wealth and consumption of the United States. The stuff about the Chinese middle class is mostly bluster, Chinese people don't live like Americans and the Earth can't support capitalism much longer, at least in its current form. One thing I've been reading recently is why Argentina, which competed with the United States as the next center of world capitalism, not only failed but was driven back into the third world from the first. Not sure it'll go anywhere but the typical case studies the left uses aren't much use. I also think Japan must be studied more closely, both before and after the war. ",t3_a9lzuq,communism

"'Although it is key to building an understanding of the political situation, analysis alone is insufficient. All mass unrest in the imperialist countries (where the “middle classes” are dominant) contains a similar kernel. Again and again we are made to confront the labor aristocracy and their yellow socialists in situations of unrest. In these moments we must have a set of directives, a plan to face the strategic realities of class struggle in the First World. Therefore the strategic tasks in times like these, as we see them, are as follows: Take stock of the mass grievances and root causes of unrest. Identify the leadership, the history, and the character if the movements in question. While these tasks are general and strategic, the answers to tactical questions of individual groupings in individual countries of the imperialist world will derive from political geographies that only they are prepared to undertake. In the first phase of our propaganda, we must identify the primary enemy—the imperialist state, monopoly capitalists and their lackeys. Explain the crisis in clear, internationalist, class terms, the goal of which should be to build unity among the most advanced elements of the struggle. This is not enough, however, as mass conflagrations are always heterogeneous, especially in the core where they are comprised of a majority of backward elements, a small section of the intermediate, and a kernel of both active and aloof advanced elements. The backward element, headed by the labor aristocracy and reactionary petty bourgeoisie, represent a grave danger for the progressive and revolutionary forces. The secondary phase of our propaganda must be to martialize the advanced and whatever intermediate forces we have accumulated against the backward element. Practically, we must aim to isolate and destroy their actions and organizations, while in our propaganda we must ruthlessly expose and attack the liberals, fence-sitters, and yellow socialists who call the attacks against the backward elements “wreckeristic” or “sectarian”. They are the ones who are sabotaging the movement against the imperialist state, and therefore communists are not dividing, but strengthening the movement by combating them. The goal of our propaganda here should be to consolidate the advanced and intermediate elements under communist leadership, to draw clear lines of demarcation between ourselves, the backward forces led by the middle classes, and the imperialist state. While we have no illusions about the strength of genuine anti-imperialists in the core countries, we do not, and cannot, discount them. Our task is to grow the anti-imperialist and internationalist movement, and to emerge from moments of mass unrest larger and more unified than before. Therefore, to identify and unite the advanced anti-imperialist, internationalist, and anti-capitalist fractions and individuals is urgent and necessary; to locate those leftists already conducting anti-imperialist work, those leftists whose work with refugees and other oppressed groups makes their involvement with the current wave of mass reaction increasingly precarious; to expose in our propaganda the crimes and nature of the imperialist state, the reactionaries, and the limits and betrayal of the squalid parochial demands of the “apolitical” labor aristocracy and the first worldist left, and in their place raise the demand for internationalism, anti-imperialism, and socialism.'",t3_a4jdhk,communism

"Of course it's possible. I can only speak for myself, but I used to think that capitalism is the end of history and communism is just a dead outdated ideology that nobody would ever think again. Communism sounds stupid to the average person because all we know communism is the equal distribution of wealth and the govt just handed money over to the people. Also 'DPRK is bad bruh' makes many people stay away from communism. Having a job was the first step for me to know the true nature of capitalism. And after realizing the unfair treatment of workers by the bosses makes me wonder 'Is there any system better than this?'. I surfed a lot on the internet and bumped into some commie memes that just funny as fuck , it started to makes me wonder what communism is truly about. So I started to do research about communism bit by bit. At first I started watching commie videos on Youtube (I really like FinBol's videos), it helped me a lot. (I already hate capitalism by this point and wanted something better than it) Later only after I think I know a thing or two about communism , I started reading books about communism. Just recently I read the Communist Manifesto and currently reading Lenin's 'Imperialism the Highest stage of Capitalism'. I still don't have the stomach to read Das Capital, holy hell that is one thick book. i guess I'm already radicalized by this point (?) &#x200B; TLDR; Having a job is what 'woke me' and memes is what introduced me to communism. It sounds dumb, but for apolitical people that never wanted to research anything about politics whatsoever, memes is one of the way to 'force' people to know something about politics. &#x200B; Sorry for bad english, I'm not native speaker.",t3_a3wp6f,communism

"Well, there's an aspect of this that Kalinin points out in the following excerpt from  that's important not to overlook: “Many people are under the false impression that the development, the shaping of the human being consists in young people occupying themselves with their Komsomol duties...[that] these Komsomol duties consist mainly of mastering the ABC of politics, studying Marxism, in a word, social problems. It seems to me that such a narrow view of problems concerning the formation of human beings is a wrong one. I recall the way we developed as Marxists in days gone by. We not only studied specifically Marxist books...while we studied the basic principles of Marxism we also covered a course of general education, beginning with the Russian classics – fiction writers, historians, critics – in a word, the whole range of knowledge to be found in books. While working in a plant, we at the same time got an all around education in literature, science, etc. I think that if, let us say, the fulfillment of Komsomol duties in our schools were to hinder the study of mathematics...if the study of mathematics or the natural sciences were to be replaced by that of the rudiments of political knowledge, then we should be doing the wrong thing. In that case, the education of a Komsomol member who has read a few books on the rudiments of political knowledge would only be superficial. In conversation he would have something to say on every subject, superficially he would appear to be educated, he would have an outward gloss, but you would not call him a developed and educated person. When you meet such a comrade he makes a very good impression at first. But just spend a few hours in conversation with him and you will see that his political knowledge has no basis, that he lacks the knowledge of the natural sciences possessed by any secondary school graduate. That is why, I think, the Komsomol organization should help not only to give the younger generation the rudiments of political knowledge but also see to it that their political knowledge is based on those branches of general education and knowledge that are considered the necessary attributes of every more or less developed person. This development, this knowledge, should not be ignored. I once made the statement at the Lobachevsky Military Academy that to study Marxism does not mean to read through Marx, Engels and Lenin; you may be able to repeat their ideas word for word, but that will not necessarily signify that you have really learned Marxism. To learn Marxism means to know after mastering the Marxist method how to approach all the other problems connected with your work. If, let us say, the sphere of your future work is agriculture, will it be of advantage to be able to employ the Marxist method? Of course it will. But to employ the Marxist method, you have to study agriculture, too, you have to be an agricultural expert. Otherwise nothing will come of your attempt to apply Marxism in agriculture. This should not be forgotten if you wish to apply Marxism in practice, if you wish to be men of action, and not text-mongers of Marxism...[T]o be able to adopt the correct, Marxist line, you also need to be a first-rate expert in your particular sphere of activity.” - M.I.

Yes they are workers of a core capitalism country, but most of us here are (ok, Russia is semi-periphery, but whatever) I don't see anything scary about anti immigration claims: we see that coming way before protests began. All we need to do in my opinion it's try to point at the culprits of the current mass immigration into EU: imperialism and bourgeois government. I'm totally agree that any proletarian is more closer to me that any capitalist, but workers right now doesn't have proletarian mindset. If communists in France were stronger we could explain internal contradiction of the anti immigration rhetoric of some pro-capitalistic representatives and need in migration for the bourgeoisie itself. But right now the only thing that Marxists can do it's try to support the protest in exchange for some more ability in the field of propaganda within masses, because anti migrant claims would get only stronger in the future. (IMO) However, at the same time, French Marxists should not lose already small and weak numbers of membership's they have. As an example Ukrainian party 'боротьба', who supported progovernment movements during coup been so far away from average ukrainians minds that nobody wanted to save them when reactionaries who came to power began to liquidate them both by legal methods limiting access to mass media and by means of the armed young bastards.

"Definitely a valid critique of capitalism. Free markets sometimes have externalities. Pollution and global warming should be factored into the cost of goods via a tax in order to discourage these behaviors since they are detrimental to society. Producers should pay for the damage they do. I identify as a centrist, and I think free markets have their use. There’s just obvious examples in which intervention in the markets is necessary. And I think that intervention almost has to come via government since it needs to be backed by a threat of force if stipulations are to be enforced on producers. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m highly skeptical of authority and I don’t naturally want to trust the state...but the state seems like a necessary evil to me since that threat of force seems essential for correcting externalities. I’m not sure that you’re getting that same threat of force in an anarchist system. But pure, unregulated capitalism can lead to some destructive outcomes no doubt.

"I'm going to purchase both of those books! Thanks! I don't know if I had this discussion with you or not, but the Bolshevik analysis of the national question left a lot to be desired. It was metaphysical in a sense, in that it didn't talk about how capitalism essentially created nations, and how national oppression is more than oppressed culture. Furthermore, Stalin himself defined nations as having a common economic life, this common economic life thus needing to be oppressed in order for national oppression to exist. On this basis, the 15 some-odd nations that the Bolsheviks gave independence to and then were reincorporated, these were not really nations. They were just areas with some linguistic and cultural differences. Besides, Ukraine and Russia were hardly even linguistically distinct. Democratic centralism doesn't have to reduce the diversity of opinion among the People to just ideas, but it tended to in the Soviet Union. I'm not opposed to centralism, and of course not opposed to democracy. But the two words combined mean more than just the sum of their components. Perhaps we could call a democratic centralist model that takes an approach more open to diversity of the proletariat a variant of democratic centralism, but I don't care to use the Soviet model as one to be exported. We need one that conforms to each nation's specific diversity. (Of course women and LGBT struggles, basically anything concerning patriarchy, will be universal, but this is not the only form of diversity.) Unity is made by agreeing that while politics are inherently competitive, you have to agree with fundamentals and not fight directly (but socially), and those who can prove the worth of their ideas or policies deserve real but temporary authority, and if reality disproves them, they will either fail or be replaced. I don't think there needs to be a one-size fits all approach to how to foster unity, depending on the situation. But I think it's entirely inappropriate and even liberal and idealist to only engage in the battle of ideas. Women should be encouraged to criticize problematic aspects of the revolution towards women, in order that it better serve their unique needs, rather than being told to pipe down as they often have for the sake of unity. If Mao saw handling contradictions as 'generally non-antagonistic' as best to achieve 'unity', and thought either was genuinely possible, then I'd like to see how he came to that conclusion, or how he justified the Cultural Revolution at all, given that it was profoundly antagonistic across intra-class and inter-class levels, at least if you compare it to Stalin's rise in the 1920s. Well, there's a reason that the CCP after Mao said that in the cultural revolution, Mao deviated from Mao Zedong Thought. It's because it does seem to violate everything else he said. (And my second biggest beef with Maoists is their dogmatism over the cultural revolution.) I would say party discipline periods are a regulation and mass debate periods are the solution. But even then, I'm talking about Soviet Russia exclusively. I am not against other countries trying other models. As I mentioned, it's more than a battle of ideas. The ideas are merely a social extension of a material reality. The crux of my argument isn't that other countries shouldn't do other models, but rather that they should, because the Soviet model is fraught with problems, some of which can actually find their origin in second international opportunism. Here's a word from Lenin about the agrarian question in the Soviet Union. It doesn't speak directly to why you say New Democracy couldn't have worked, but it does recognize some of the limitations Lenin and Stalin faced in collectivization: 'I must emphasize the quite specific nature of the response given to the agrarian question by the Chinese Revolution. The distributed (agricultural) land was not privatized; it remained the property of the nation represented by village communes and only the use was given to rural families. That had not been the case in Russia where Lenin, faced with the fait accompli of the peasant insurrection in 1917, recognized the private property of the beneficiaries of land distribution. Why was the implementation of the principle that agricultural land is not a commodity possible in China (and Vietnam)? It is constantly repeated that peasants around the world long for property and that alone. If such had been the case in China, the decision to nationalize the land would have led to an endless peasant war, as was the case when Stalin began forced collectivization in the Soviet Union.' That being said, it doesn't address the part about a national bourgeoisie, because the bourgeoisie seemed to be entirely comprador. Nevertheless, perhaps some measures could have been taken to encourage the bourgeoisie to shift from comprador to national. Perhaps due to a more orthodox theory, the Bolsheviks didn't consider this analysis, the bourgeoisie being the ultimate enemy instead of imperialism. I don't know, you could be right. Soviet history seems to be filled with no-right choices, where everything is a lose-lose. Either you kill the bourgeois, or they win, no compromise. Either you alienate the large segments of the peasantry and hyper develop heavy industry, or you get overthrown by fascism. Either you remain stagnant, or you make capitalist reforms. But don't they at least have broad similarities? That's what I was thinking about. I recently saw a Cuba thread where apparently their model of participatory democracy is heavily influenced by North Korea (though I have no sources on that). In practice, the DPRK is essentially Marxist Leninist, yes. Regardless if it is or not, I'm not in favor of leaving progressive nations in the Third World out of the anti-imperialist movement. A lot of people disagree with the way a country does things, then that 'radical opposition' slowly degenerates into CIA propaganda.

"*The State and the Revolution* was the book that first turned me away from liberal analysis and anarchist conclusions towards dialectical materialist analysis and revolutionary conclusions. I definitely recommend it for anyone interested in left wing politics. It will break that liberal bubble. It's the best summation of the Marxist view of the state. After that book, I recommend 'On Contradiction' and 'On Practice,' and really the whole first volume of Mao's selected works. I'd also recommend Engels' pamphlet, 'Socialism, Utopian and Scientific' and Stalin's work, 'Dialectical and Historical Materialism.'",t3_aa15bn,communism
" is the best summary I've ever read of Mao on Stalin. I don't think he wrote a critique on the Foundations of Leninism. I'll copy some portions from the end where it goes over a summary, but I recommend reading the whole thing, and I'll add some thoughts to Mao's criticism: While Stalin kept to a materialist stance in philosophy, his understanding and application of dialectics was much more uneven. He failed to recognize the centrality of the concept of contradiction in dialectics, and often failed to recognize the existence of important social and class contradictions. Very real criticism of Stalin's philosophy. But I think it's important not to put too much weight on this as some Comrades have. While it has certainly guided wrong policy, it itself is not the cause for the rise of the right wing in the Soviet Union. Such a suggestion is idealism, as it puts theory above practice. For all his personal philosophical shortcomings, the rise of the right could have been avoided had different policies been implemented. Specifically, Stalin failed to understand that even after the collectivization of agriculture class contradictions still existed in the countryside, and class struggle would continue there. And more generally, Stalin failed to recognize that even after the basic construction of socialism in the USSR, class struggle still continued, and the contradiction between the socialist and capitalist roads still continued—not only in society generally, but also within the Communist Party. Because of this lack of appreciation of the continuation of class struggle in socialist society, Stalin tended to reduce the threat of capitalist restoration within the USSR to just the possibility of armed attack by foreign imperialism (though that was indeed a legitimate and serious worry). Again, very true, but not to be overemphasized, as the rise of the right doesn't come from the failure of ideas alone, but from the material conditions in which those ideas exist. Within the USSR, Stalin had a “paternalistic” approach toward the masses, and sought to change and run society for them, instead of using the mass line method of mobilizing the masses to change and run society for themselves. Stalin did not use the mass line either in politics or in economic work. Specific examples: Stalin failed to rely on the masses in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and enemy agents, instead relying almost entirely on the security agencies to do this. Similarly, Stalin failed to rely on the masses to ward off the danger of a general capitalist restoration. Even in economic work he tended in later years to rely more on cadres and technology than on the masses. Stalin confused contradictions among the people with the contradictions between the people and the enemy. Specifically, he unjustly imprisoned or executed a great many people. Within the Soviet Union, the CPSU and the International Communist Movement, Stalin insisted on complete obedience from everyone, and would brook no criticisms from anyone. He was suspicious and mistrustful of those whose complete obedience and total agreement he questioned. Paternalistic is a great way to say it. Not, we don't want to say that Stalin was a dictator, because that would suggest he was antagonistic to the masses. But there was a lack of democracy in politics, even as worker's assemblies and all existed. So far, this is one of the criticisms of Stalin most closely linked to the rise of revisionism. The masses were alienated from political life, which is one of the hallmarks of bourgeois governance. It is no surprise then that bourgeois ideas would emerge dominant. In his relations with other countries, including China, Stalin often acted as a “great nation chauvinist”, and even at times like an imperialist might act. This, however, I find dangerous language. (Fortunately, imperialist was not Mao's word, but the words of the people summarizing.) But to call his behavior imperialist for acting in the national interest is not a just criticism. Many Comrades take a metaphysical approach to socialist foreign policy, where the utmost of solidarity is demanded, even if the conditions for such solidarity do not exist. It's completely okay and normal for socialist countries to have relations with capitalist countries. It could be no other way. Stalin promoted the construction of an inappropriate and metaphysical personality cult around himself as an individual. [This criticism is unfortunately somewhat ironic, given that Mao later did this as well!] This seems iffy. I've heard/read that the cult of personality was more brought on by the Party than by Stalin himself, although this certainly requires further examination. But the comparison to Mao certainly isn't appropriate, as his was more organic, not to say that it was good. In economics, Stalin seriously neglected agriculture and light industry, and put lopsided emphasis on heavy industry. Similarly, Stalin gave insufficient attention to raising the living standards of the masses (especially the peasants). Stalin seemed to be at a loss as to how to transform cooperative production in agriculture into state production, and how to transform the peasantry into agricultural workers. More generally, after the early transformations of industry and agriculture, Stalin seemed to resign himself to the continuation of the existing relations of production and did not try to further transform them in the direction of communism. Coming back to the standard of living of the peasantry, there's another serious criticism here. Similar to the bourgeois characteristics of governance mentioned above, the prioritizing of urban development over rural development is a characteristic of bourgeois economic and social development as well. Likewise, it should be no surprise in this situation that bourgeois ideas emerged dominant. Stalin did not show sufficient vigilance in the period before the German attack on the Soviet Union, and grossly miscalculated as to when that attack might occur. Nevertheless he did successfully lead the Soviet Union and the world in defeating Hitler. On the other hand, Stalin tended to be too frightened of the imperialist powers, way too cautious, and even attempted to prevent revolutions in other countries because he feared they might lead to the involvement of the USSR in a war. At several key points, he even tried to prevent the Chinese Revolution from proceeding. Eh. It's understandable after a couple dozen countries (!) invaded during the civil war. Caution is normal on Stalin's part. As I mentioned, many Comrades have idealist opinions towards socialist foreign policy. Stalin did not do a good job in training and preparing his successors. (This, alas, also turned out to be true of Mao.) Eh. Would not have been a problem had there been fewer bourgeois elements in the model of development and governance, the question of successors would not hold as much prominence. Plus, Deng was no Khrushchev!!",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"That’s an interesting way to think about it. The first thing that comes to mind is the Nazi campaign to promote motherhood and the role of women as homemakers. Weimer Germany had seen an unprecedented number of women entering the workplace, even in heavy industry. Under the Nazis, Germany saw its unemployment rate shrink dramatically, which gave it a certain cache with chronically unemployed men (many of whom were WWI veterans). This was accomplished by taking women out of the workforce entirely. Nazi anti-Semitism had a similar function. The dispossession and redistribution of Jewish property, first through more or less legal means and later through extra-legal terror, accomplished three tasks: First, German-owned monopolies in retail saw their biggest competitors literally disappear. Second, it placated the more radical urges of the so-called “Nazi Left” that believed in ‘national socialism’ on its face - before the Night of Long Knives, no small feat for Hitler holding onto power. Third, and maybe most important, Jewish property was redistributed to Nazi Party apparatchiks, most of whom came from middle class or lumpen backgrounds. It gave the party a large degree of control and importance in the economy that they leveraged over less cooperative capitalist sectors. Anti-semitism fulfilled the task of creating, through terror and outright theft, a Nazi bourgeoisie within the party. I’m not sure it’s a replication of primitive accumulation and its social conditions, though it bears some commonalities. These trends are always present in capitalism (social conservatism), and within the fascist states of the 20th century, their forms reflected the nature of the crisis in imperialism after WWI.",t3_a5scwf,communism

"Welcome friend thanks for your questions. 1.to be a communist in 2018 means the same as being a communist in 1922 you accept that capitalism is an extremely flawed system that exploits the workers and that the system itself is horrendously inefficient. 2.we believe in a planed economy in witch the major industry is nationalized and put in to the peoples hands. 3.the opinion that would matter most would be the people as you can’t have a revolution without public support. 4. Our values are anti imperialism,anti capitalism, anti fascism, as well as standing against racism and sexism. 5.the establishment of a socialist state could happen two ways. The first is through a revolution and the other is the communist party was voted in to power and then they set up the socialist state. As for economic growth, the new communist government would not be focused on economic growth as much as they would focus on the needs of the people. 6.As far as documentary’s go you won’t really find anything thing that isn’t biased towards capitalism.

"That’s actually not true; I know for a fact Mao and Lenin both wrote about “state capitalism”. You’re right about China’s current method being (loosely) based on the NEP though. In my experience, when you hear “state capitalism” applied to China (or the USSR, Vietnam etc. - even Cuba, apparently), it’s always done by either anarchists, MLMs or Left-Coms. It’s a really simple and lazy analysis, imo, and the term “market socialism” would probably be much more accurate / in line with what the CPC is actually doing. They’re allowing private markets, but only under very strict supervision by the Party - and the private economy makes up a very tiny percentage of the overall economy. In other words, the economy is more-or-less democratically controlled, and most of it is publicly owned too. To call this state of affairs “state capitalism” is, again, lazy, since in order to do so, you have to *really* cherry-pick your evidence and not be very interested in nuance. I think it’s fair to say that, all things considered, China is still on the socialist path - albeit not in the traditional sense. Other countries have had experiments in “market socialism”, such as Yugoslavia. Even the Soviet Union did so for a time. It’s obviously a legitimate path toward building socialism, and China has very specific reasons for taking this path, which are based in material analyses of many conditions exclusive to the Chinese context.

The bourgeoisie also attempt to manipulate proletarians into not only accepting their exploitation but into supporting and furthering it as well.

Look at the Cato Institute. Very influential and effective in spreading this nonsense.

I remember he'd talk to us about banks, capital, money, ecology, that stuff. I remember how he hooked a few guys in was when he taught us how companies want to make us aware of water consumption while they are the ones to be aware. suddenly, a lot of people in the class started to talk about it. then he slowly moved to big corporations and how much money they do, and how little we receive back. he also talked about his lifestyle, how suffered and went through a dictatorship, etc. it worked. and not with forceful opinions, he was so sweet when talking. he just listened, let people talk, and then pointed out to them using topics which we were most close to. in Brazil, the working class won't care too much about being oppressed, they don't get the whole idea too much. but he used that to his advantage, because he knew we were never educated and only listened to what the boss said. he grabbed the idea Bolsa Familia a tiny portion of money it's given back to the poor out of how much the state makes and how much it is given to bigger corporations. of course he didn't make the whole class aware of these topics, but I do remember he could talk to a few conservative ladies and guys about feminism, communism and class-consciousness, without ever mentioning these topics. in the end, out of 20 students, everyone respected and listened to him, and only 1 out of these people I have seen adhering to fascism opinions. with him I learned that, what and how you will speak will depend entirely on the education the person received. and, last but not least, young audiences seems to work more with the idea of revolt, rebel, so he mentioned how he rebelled during the dictatorship. that's how he got me.",t3_a3rhdy,communism

"For another angle to this, in addition to the other replies, we can turn to Stalin's : 'Some people believe that Marxism and anarchism are based on the same principles and that the disagreements between them concern only tactics, so that, in the opinion of these people, it is quite impossible to draw a contrast between these two trends. This is a great mistake. We believe that the Anarchists are real enemies of Marxism. Accordingly, we also hold that a real struggle must be waged against real enemies. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the 'doctrine' of the Anarchists from beginning to end and weigh it up thoroughly from all aspects. The point is that Marxism and anarchism are built up on entirely different principles, in spite of the fact that both come into the arena of the struggle under the flag of socialism. The cornerstone of anarchism is the individual, whose emancipation, according to its tenets, is the principal condition for the emancipation of the masses, the collective body. According to the tenets of anarchism, the emancipation of the masses is impossible until the individual is emancipated. Accordingly, its slogan is: 'Everything for the individual.' The cornerstone of Marxism, however, is the masses, whose emancipation, according to its tenets, is the principal condition for the emancipation of the individual. That is to say, according to the tenets of Marxism, the emancipation of the individual is impossible until the masses are emancipated. Accordingly, its slogan is: 'Everything for the masses.'

"I've read a little of Ian Scoones' work (Zimbabwe’s Land Reform: Myths and Realities, 2010, Debating Zimbabwe’s Land Reform, 2014), and he argues a similar point when he writes that small production was broadly successful in Zimbabwe (among the other larger forms of production). Apparently, it is a big debate among specialists on land reform in Africa, and there are scholars (like Scoones) who argue small producers should become the predominant social form as far as agriculture is concerned. I'm not an imperialist or a colonizer, so I support whatever progressive African movements and governments do over there. I was exclusively arguing for a democratic centralization of unions in Soviet agriculture (as that is what worked in the cities and was probably a historical necessity) being the 'obvious way to go' because I think it helped contextualize the deeper problems of Russian history (perpetual geopolitical threat and inter-clan violence escalating inter-class violence, as M. T. Poe argues in The Russian Moment in World History, 2003, and J. A. Getty argues in Practicing Stalinism, 2013). I was just pointing to the absurdity of being a Bukharinite. It is less absurd than being a Trotskyist though. I honestly don't know where the lines between Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong Thought, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and Third Worldism ever draw themselves and become distinct. It's like I have radically different pictures of who Mao was from these and other perspectives, and don't know where to place him or his contributions in Marxist history. Albert  with the RCP about 'social imperialism,' and I think he exposed their formal appeals to theory (Leninist definition) not helping their lack of understanding of the formal institutional process of Soviet economic and foreign policy (and their social relations). Imperialism itself has changed in many ways, and people are still clinging to Lenin's exact definition. The imperialist center is far less concerned with 'primitive' industrialization (most of the world, including most of the countries of Africa, has had about 20 to 25 percent of its per capita GDP based in manufacturing for decades now, and about two thirds of total manufacturing goods are produced by corporations, subsidiaries, and subcontractors in the Third World, according to UNCTAD) as a competitive possibility for the periphery and semi-periphery to get out of unequal exchange (and other inter-branching structures of monopoly capital). The main goal now is maintaining a permanent monopoly of the most intensive methods and advanced technologies of production and stopping China from reaching and surpassing those monopolies (and sharing those methods and technologies, then building trans-national infrastructure, then refining a trans-national infrastructure for advanced education and scientific and technological revolution). If China and its allies can gradually cut into Western monopoly profits with a combined and advanced system of production, they can take as much wealth back to form a greater share for the Third World and achieve a superior standard of equitable distribution (internal and external). I've seen Giovanni Arrighi and Alan Freeman mention it in passing, and John A. Smith's book Imperialism in the Twenty-First Century (2015) gives great information about it but does not give a coherent explanation or vision (in my opinion). I don't know if there is better work on the question of the modern day 'product cycle' as an intensive and not extensive phenomenon.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

Otherwise I'd suggest trying to sneak in pro-labourer points without ever mentioning the word 'communism'.

Just encourage people when they bitch about their boss, be supportive of worker unions, point out how people are born into wealth instead of earning it, and be eager to talk about the general income inequality and lack of economic mobility.

Capitalism is a driving force behind the quiet desperation of their lives. But they would rather take the blue pill of sustenance for this system, with its illusion of meritocracy, healthy competition and security, rather than the red pill of liberation.

There is no discussion of how many died in the civil war that involved the arrest of the Gang of Four and Deng's seizure of power, which from what I've read was more deadly. The whole first part is him just denouncing everything that was politically correct about the socialist period in China, while trying to claim Mao's legacy. In part 1 Deng resurrects Liu Shiaoqi. In part 2 he takes up his line in accepting capitalist methods to develop China. This is consistent with his condemnation of the Great Leap in part 1. He upholds Stalin, and opposes Kruschev, but seems to just parrot Mao, while basing his own judgments on the pragmatic effects on China of each leader. He goes on to defend other oppressed nations against the interviewers attacks, and has a decent line on international affairs.

The internet in the West was essentially just released to the people by and large, complete anarchy. Not only is it full of problems, such as privacy and capitalist media competition, but the social consequences of the way the West has created access to the internet have been tremendous. Look at the social alienation, the addiction, etc. etc. It has accelerated the isolation of individuals from one another, addicted to video games or social media, always behind a screen and rarely interacting with their fellow human beings. It has been tremendous. For this reason alone, I give *a lot* of credit to socialist governments who have been slowly and carefully implementing the internet.

This 'French nation' can not be free so long as it keeps others in shackles and whines about petrol taxes. At any rate, we should call for the proletarian revolutionaries to liquidate the political power of fascists like OP and the author of this article ",t3_a2d7o6,communism

His revolution came from a military coup, not a popular uprising. While the revolution was backed by the masses, it did not originate from the masses. Thus, there was not much bottom-up organizing among the people. Most were not very politically literate, just sort of going with the flow of Sankaras will. Thus, when he was assassinated and the leadership went reactionary, there was no real popular support to return to his policies. In conclusion; his main problem was not being able to secure the revolution in the people and dying for his idealism. He was the revolution personified and it died with him.

Now we have to have an opinion on something no one even knew existed when it was passed last summer. The far right is also capable of international coordination on these issues while the social democratic left's attempt at the same thing in Greece, Spain, Portugal, and the UK has been a disaster. That's not to say the real left should follow the tactics of the far right, the far right's success has come precisely because of the complete bankrupcy of the social democratic left and the socialist parties who believe they are on the same side as the new social imperialists. DSA and Corbyn's labor aspire to be the social democratic parties that already sold out to neoliberalism and syriza is their best case scenario. The actual left of course has nothing to do with any of them. Its news and what it considers important is very different and has a very different tempo than the immediacy of the corporate media's 24 hour breaking news which people have to have an opinion on at all times and in its nature allows the far right to flourish (Trump got billions of dollars in free advertising, who even knows what that number is for the far right globally).

"Stalin was neither a sinner, nor was he a saint. That's what I like to say about him. He did a lot of good things, such as building and nurturing socialism in the USSR, some bad things, like recriminalising Homosexuality in 1933, and a lot of questionable things, like his actions during the Russian Civil war, where he allegedly ordered entire villages to be razed in order to ensure compliance with the food collection programs. A lot of the things about him are merely propaganda, for example the Great Purge and Terror was mostly because of Nikolai Yehzov and Laventry Beria (the former Stalin had executed in 1940), and Holodomor, which to this day has had no evidence found that indicates Stalin intended to starve a population of the USSR. In fact, the idea that it was an intentional genocide comes from 1933 Nazi Propaganda. (Tottle, Douglas (1987), Fraud, Famine and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard). Stalin did use somewhat questionable methods to ensure compliance with new Communist policies, but it's not like he didn't try to be 'nice'. Collectivisation was voluntary but heavily encouraged in the USSR between 1927 and 1930, when Stalin made it mandatory in order to start building up grain reserves in the event of a famine, which was quite common at the time. The Peasants resisted, then there was a famine and the peasants protested the lack of food in the reserves, which was because there were no grain reserves, because the peasants had resisted.. Stalin was a man of his time. Hard times create strong men, I suppose, and the 1920s and 30s were especially hard times for the USSR, because of the Nazis. Stalin knew a war was coming, and his policies reflect that. Fortunately, it all paid off, and the final layer of defence-the Stalin line-was being put in place when the Nazis invaded. It also reflects the sheer industrial and resource capability of the USSR, with the US producing 43,000 M4 Sherman tanks and the USSR producing 84,000 T-34 tanks. Stalin was a man of the time. He did a lot of good things and some bad things that, in hindsight, can be seen as necessary evils (like the Gulags, which played an important part in building industry for the USSR.) He shouldn't be barred from criticism, but his good deeds shouldn't be overshadowed by the bad.",t3_aa3tjd,communism

"Lenins *Imperialism* goes into depth about some of the contradictons inheritant to Capitalism, and Karl Marx wrote some about it as well in *Das Kapital*. Communism is defined as stateless, classoess and moneyless, and Socialism is the process of eventually getting to Communism. Communism can only be achieved globally, so that's why you'll often here Communist say that there has never been a Communist state, it's a contradiction. Capitalism is an economic system, and in the US it is managed by a 'Republic' (there's more evidence the states is an oilgarchy but that's a different topic) which is supposed to be the federal and state system. In Capitalism the state is inseparable from the economic system, just as Communism cannot have a state. Capitalism requires growth, which is it's primary contradiction as limitless growth is literally impossible and this creates a system of economic 'recessions' that are actually fundamental to the way the economy works. When Capital is no longer growing fast enough domestically the state will employ it's military (or paramilitaries) to allow domestic companies to expand into foriegn markets. This stage is called 'Imperialism' and it is the highest form of Capitalism, we see a form of it in the USA today. Finally as the contradictons of the system come to a close the system starts to break apart as Capitalism creates a larger and larger Proletariat class who are more and more upset with the system. The state must employ it's military and police forces to maintain order and prevent a reduction in profit. This is called *Fascism* and is the natural result of Capitalism in decline, those who have money have power and they will do whatever is nessesary to preserve it. They further divide the population by arbitrary lines to decrease the chance of mass organization. Finally we have the mathematics. This is a little abstract, but Communism uses a planned economy which is based on the Labour Theory of Value. If you'd like to learn more about the labour theory if value let me know but I feel like I've written a lot here already haha.",t3_a6efos,communism

"I am not doing that, in the context of the para you quoted I was just trying to explain what the author was talking about. You seem to be talking about the different rates of turnover of fixed capital. This is how the author describes the matter in another post. I am not sure why you disagree with him. >Assuming there are no barriers to the free flow of capital among the various branches of production—that is, free competition or, as Adam Smith called it, “perfect liberty”—competition among capitals will tend towards a situation where capitals of equal size earn equal profits in equal periods of time. >But this leads to a contradiction. Capitals that employ a larger than average amount of fixed capital have longer turnover periods than those that employ a smaller amount of fixed capital on average. But do not the branches of production that experience longer than average turnover periods for their capitals have to charge—all else remaining equal—higher prices than capitals in those branches of industry that experience shorter than average turnover periods? If they don’t, capitals with different turnover periods cannot realize equal profits in *equal periods of time*. >**The fine wines aged in old oak chests problem** >The example that was often given to illustrate capital with a long turnover period is fine wine aged in old oak chests over many years. As the wine sits in the chests, it appears to be accruing “interest,” much like money in a high-yielding savings account does, even though it is not absorbing any additional human labor. >Modern bourgeois economists argue that this shows that the law of labor value cannot possibly be true. According to them, not only the labor the wine absorbs through the process of production but the “interest” the wine earns while aging in old chests prove that the wine and the chests are also producing value. Indeed, isn’t it true that wines aged over many years are very expensive due to this accrued “interest”? >Since the days of Adam Smith, virtually all schools of economics—the classical school, the Marxist school, and the marginalist school, though the marginalists will say equal rate of interest rather than profit—have accepted this basic economic law. But why is there an apparent contradiction between the values of commodities being determined by the quantity of labor necessary to produce them, on one hand, and the tendency of the rate of profit to equalize, on the other?

I think the revolutionary court ruled it legal when they were caught because there was no law against it. Still the overall population was still very conservative in many respects and so was much, although not all, of it's new leadership.

"The article is further evidence of how disgustingly transphobic the CPGB-ML are, if you ask me. Not only does the author of the article knowingly misgender a trans woman as 'this man', it also calls transgender rights a 'bourgeois ideology'. In my opinion, discussing the struggle of LGBT+ people isn't a distraction from the wider class struggle as the CPGB-ML seem to believe, but rather an element of class struggle that deserves to be discussed, not ignored because the CPGB-ML's Central Committee (Ranjeet Brar in particular) hates trans comrades. Lenin's thoughts on focusing on smaller elements within the wider class struggle were quite clear in 'What Is To Be Done?' >“Is it true that, in general, the economic struggle “is the most widely applicable means” of drawing the masses into the political struggle? It is entirely untrue. Any and every manifestation of police tyranny and autocratic outrage, not only in connection with the economic struggle, is not one whit less “widely applicable” as a means of “drawing in” the masses. The rural superintendents and the flogging of peasants, the corruption of the officials and the police treatment of the “common people” in the cities, the fight against the famine-stricken and the suppression of the popular striving towards enlightenment and knowledge, the extortion of taxes and the persecution of the religious sects, the humiliating treatment of soldiers and the barrack methods in the treatment of the students and liberal intellectuals — do all these and a thousand other similar manifestations of tyranny, though not directly connected with the “economic” struggle, represent, in general, less “widely applicable” means and occasions for political agitation and for drawing the masses into the political struggle? The very opposite is true. Of the sum total of cases in which the workers suffer (either on their own account or on account of those closely connected with them) from tyranny, violence, and the lack of rights, undoubtedly only a small minority represent cases of police tyranny in the trade union struggle as such. Why then should we, beforehand, restrict the scope of political agitation by declaring only one of the means to be “the most widely applicable”, when Social-Democrats must have, in addition, other, generally speaking, no less “widely applicable” means?'

"Gen. Augusto Pinochet's death on Dec. 10 means the Bush Family can breathe a little bit easier, knowing that criminal proceedings against Chile's notorious dictator can no longer implicate his longtime friend and protector, former President George H.W. Bush. Although Chilean investigations against other defendants may continue, the cases against Pinochet end with his death of a heart attack at the age of 91. Pinochet's death from natural causes also marks a victory for world leaders, including George H.W. and George W. Bush, who shielded Pinochet from justice over the past three decades. The Bush Family's role in the Pinochet cover-up began in 1976 when then-CIA Director George H.W. Bush diverted investigators away from Pinochet's guilt in a car bombing in Washington that killed political rival Orlando Letelier and an American, Ronni Moffitt. The cover-up stretched into the presidency of George W. Bush when he sidetracked an FBI recommendation to indict Pinochet in the Letelier-Moffitt murders. ",t3_a23afi,communism

">All of that considered, thanks to the generosity of the people, he got up close and personal with the real situation they were living in. A few different families let him stay in their home and he got first hand experience that was real and tangible. During this time, he saw many of the “dehumanizing effects of poverty and the multiple consequences of economic injustice” (Beadle 180). Orwell opens the second chapter of the first part talking about how “our civilization… is founded on coal” and how the working men of the mines are the “second in importance only to the man who ploughs the soil” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 20). What a profound truth of the matter this is. It’s very rare anyone calls attention to the question of where do all the commodities one owns comes from. Even rarer still is the calling to attention of our energy and food production, and the working class people that do their jobs and allow others to eat and sleep in comfort and have one less thing to worry about. But do these people get their share or fame or worship? Orwell answers that; their reward is “scrambling for the coal” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 101). >Orwell describes when an unemployed miner took him to go see the great daily scramble. How “with a wild yell a hundred men dashed down the slope to catch” a train while it’s moving, and jump onto it (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 101). They would pray their container had coal, otherwise it might have dirt, or shale. These same workers working day in and day out in the mines where one can barely stand making it harder to shovel, where the heat can sometimes be “suffocating”, where the “coal dust” in the air “stuffs up your throat and nostrils and collects along your eyelids” and the awful sound of the conveyor belt that is amplified thanks to the “confined space” and makes it sound like a “rattle of a machine gun” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 23). These people aren’t looked after or cared for, and that’s just the truth of the matter. These are the actual physical, material conditions these people live in. >Orwell isn’t reluctant to criticize the workers, however. Orwell declares that “unemployment is an endless misery” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 96). Which it is, as it increases the chances of death, separation divorces, family violence, suicide rates, cancer, accidents, and the list goes on (Smith 972). But after the conditions Orwell experiences, he describes how some of them are so wasteful of food. Of course, he says the poorest are better at not wasting. “[B]ut those who can afford to waste food often do so” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 98). He chalks this up to the “generous English attitude to life” but the second half of The Road to Wigan Pier gives a much more insightful look into the matter. If part one was about the working class, then part two was about the middle class. Socialists usually talk about two classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the business and factory owners, and the people who work. While this is correct, there are “class distinctions” that are significant and separate the working classes (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 127). The middle class was born, in part, out of the constant contradiction between the workers and the owners over wages and standard of living, causing the owners to pay their workers more. Thus creating a class with more wealth and capital to live their lives and not be constantly fighting to pay for food like the working class. Another distinction between the two is, as Orwell puts it, “the lower classes smell” or that’s at least what the middle class, and certainly Orwell, was taught (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 127-128). And to be honest, Orwell is right. The working class have less time and money to keep themselves in good health, especially being clean. This is why, as stated earlier, being unemployed causes so many health risks (Smith 972). It would be like saying the working class do not eat as well as the upper classes; of course they don’t, they earn no money and must jump onto a train just to keep themselves warm at night. >Orwell goes on to talk about the middle class person who joins the Communist Party, or who occasionally votes them or the Labour Party in elections, but doesn’t change their “bourgeois economic status” and how their vote changes so little (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 135). He doesn’t blame them for trying, or not changing their habits, as it’s naïve to think they should commit themselves to poverty. But he does criticize that they are still playing at what they were taught as children and that they still think the working class is “disgusting” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 136). Orwell continues to be highly critical of the Socialist movement as it has evolved since Marx’ and Engels’ day. He jumps right into explosive detail about the arguments surrounding Socialism. Orwell talks about the “legend of Communism leading to Fascism” and how the Bolshevik Revolution has led to a state capitalist and arguably fascist society (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 187). Orwell then addresses the technology loving Socialists who praise advancement and claim it will be faster under Socialism. But Orwell points at this disingenuous argument, and points out that this is bound to improve for any society, Socialist or not. He recalls that Socialism was supposed to set people free, but it’s lost it’s way. That Socialism is no longer about “revolution and the overthrow of tyrants” but of “machine-worship and the stupid cult of Russia” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 216). He fears that Fascism will win. >Months after writing this, Orwell was in Catalonia, fighting a revolution against a Fascist government and lost. In many ways this was him trying to commit to and understand his fellow working class. Much like his staying with workers in England. However, in The Road to Wigan Pier he was critical and made fun of people using the word “Comrade”. But when he fighting he understands it’s use and origin in the Socialist movement, how no one was above anyone else and they were all equal. Obviously, it’s different material conditions, having a middle class person say ‘Comrade’ when referring to a coworker as they go out to a pub. Compared to a group of people fighting a revolution who have actually changed their physical conditions surrounding themselves. But one key thing sticks out in the opening pages to Homage to Catalonia. He meets a comrade who can’t speak English, so they don’t say much to one another. But Orwell is just overcome with joy and affection for his comrade. “Queer, the affection you can feel for a stranger! It was as though his spirit and mine had momentarily succeeded in bridging the gulf of language” (Orwell, Homage to Catalonia 3). Now, of course some of that is the emotions running high as one is in war. But it’s also such a powerful emotional response to someone you can’t communicate with. It’s a perfect testament to Orwell’s feelings towards Socialism. All the words unsaid between them, the mutual understand that they are in it together. No class distinctions, no capital divide, no theory, just two people physically being there. They do not need to tell each other why they are here, they know they both are fighting for freedom, liberation, and equality. “Socialism as a world system and wholeheartedly applied is a way out” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 171). Orwell means this to every extent. After his time in India, England, Spain, and elsewhere, he believes in Socialism. The global, historical context leading up to 1936 and Orwell’s time in northern England speaks volumes, much more than just the pages he dedicated to the first part. The class distinctions and praise of Marx and workers, but his continued acceptance of Socialism as an economic and political system that would free the people is unfaltering. Using The Road to Wigan Pier one can get a sense of the time Orwell lived in, the physical and emotional stress of poverty and unemployment. The current state of the classes and why there hasn’t been a revolution. Orwell might be critical of his comrades, and rightfully so. But they are the ones he had. Readers today should be wise to read the excellent material research and analysis of the time and learn from it and apply it today. ",t3_a6a695,communism

"I wrote a whole spiel about how DSA sheepdogs socialists into warmongering before deleting it because I felt like I hadn't read the article close enough to say something so definitive, but after rereading I can really see how people dupe themselves into thinking they're not being sheepdogged. &#x200B; The crux of this article is an appeal to a 'non-secterian' anti-imperialist analysis that neither borrows from 'democratic socialism', which is hilarious by itself because democratic socialism, in the sense of European social democracy, has always betrayed internationalism for national chauvinism, or 'marxism-leninism', ie the ideology which has always been the backbone of anti-imperialist movements on the Left abroad. This sounds nice and pretty, but what does it really mean? They implore the reader to listen to the 'people of china' and understand them to form a 'better' anti-imperialist analysis of the situation, but at the end of the day what is an appeal to the people if not a liberal appeal for 'freedom and democracy, the american way.' They assure that they do not support the overthrow of the CPC or war with China, but what is the point of this hand-wringing over increased Chinese aggression if not to create anxiety over the ascendant rival to the US abroad. Frankly, its very arguable that China's rise has been a net positive for peace, ignoring that they are a socialist country, if only because they present a check to the US' unbridled murder machine that has been raging nearly nonstop since the fall of the Soviet Union. At the end of the day, the article fails to answer its own question, 'how do we oppose china without lapsing into western 'paternalism' (which should be read as chauvinism)' because there really isn't an answer.",t3_a3s0r1,communism

And Marx was Objectively wrong on a few things (such as the first socialist state/ground zero for revolution being Germany). This is why there are so many different schools of thought in Marxism, we are mainly influenced by Marx and Hegel, but of course we are influenced by other philosophies, and as such we will disagree and have different lines.

">Can somebody give me a brief overview of why Stalin is so loved by the Communist community? Sure. His organizing efforts helped lay the groundwork for the the 1917 revolutions, he defended the revolution from the white army during the war, he then did years of practical work after the war stabilizing the country and modernizing housing, healthcare, education, and etc (illiteracy, homelessness were virtually eliminated and life expectancy doubled from 30 to 60). He helped create a planned economy that was growing at multiple times the US and brought the Union from a semi-feudal economy to a world industrial powerhouse. He brought the force of the state against fascists that had been terrorizing the countryside since before the revolution. The nazis were defeated under his leadership. The groundwork for space travel was laid under his direction. AFAIK Stalin was a pretty bad dude Check out the debunking link in the sidebar. Our values and history in the first world come from a ruling class that has an interest in promoting values and history that supports and excuses them. Therefore jailing fascists for which some died early (particularly during the war) suddenly become 'he killed millions of his own citizens.' Nevermind the context of the fact that if he didn't the revolution would not have survived 10 years. definitely not someone who should be used as a poster boy for communism. Given how liberals view him I can see that, however liberals are going to accuse every mildly left person of being literally Stalin. Sitting around and ceding the past to the capitalists doesn't help us. Decades of left anticommunism have proven that being sufficiently anti-Stalin isn't going to just make them buy in. Did Stalin make mistakes? Sure. Did he do a lot of really awesome things too? Yea. Therefore we must be analytical. What did he actually do that makes anyone like him? See first paragraph, but ultimately transformed the USSR under his leadership (he wasn't alone) and held the country together through the fascist onslaught.",t3_a7u3y4,communism

This is an indefensible position, the Psl is clearly not the only communist party trying to change things, and arguing with human extinction is an invitation to being dismissed. >Events of the past few months have revealed a pervasive culture of misogyny within the Party for Socialism and Liberation and made abundantly clear to many women, including myself and several comrades with whom I’ve spoken, that no party, as of now, is equipped to protect women I'm puzzled here i was expecting a demand for equality and inclusion.

"For the first part: Workers should have a voice and be considered when making decisions. Industrial democracy is a system that I can get behind...a little bit. But the devil lies in the details. For instance, should every worker have an equal voice? Suppose you have five entry level employee for every experienced manager...would the entry level employee be as good at making decisions as the manager? If not, you could conceivably have a situation to where irrational decisions are made and resources are not used as efficiently as it could have been if decisions were made by the management team. The entry level employees could also attempt to use their majority power to extract MORE than their value of labor. BUT, it is undoubtedly true that if the management team has too much power then they could seek to extract value from the product of labor produced by the entry level employees. However, if we assume mobility of labor and assume that a competitive market exists, it should theoretically be impossible to extract too much product of labor because you could have a competing firm down the street saying “hey, if you work for us, we’ll pay you a little bit more because we can afford to do so” I think giving all employees an ownership stake and a vote in a company is good. But more productive and efficient employees deserve higher wages and more of a vote in my opinion. When you assume a competitive market, I think this works. I think it leads to a balanced society to where we are promoting equality to an extent, but not sacrificing efficiency. Collective ownership where everyone has the same power is probably perilous...because some people are naturally better at using resources more efficiently and they are going to make better decisions. But notice I said that a competitive market HAS to exist! If it does not, you’re back in the Guilded Age and that is awful. And I do want everyone to be paid their product of labor, but keep in mind that profits don’t necessarily represent the failure to pay labor fairly. Labor also uses capital. The labor would not be as productive without that capital. If my job is to push a button, and every time I do so, a car magically poofs into existence, then I should not be entitled to the sticker price of the car. My contribution in the production process was merely pushing a button. The contributions of this amazing machine was much more valuable. Thus, the owner of the machine should be entitled to most of the earnings generated when selling the car...but even better the person that built the amazing machine should have been paid a fortune when it was purchased. So they should have gotten a lot for the contribution of their labor. I am really intrigued by the idea of industrial democracy. I just think it needs to be heavily modified and done in a way to where the level of power and compensation depends somewhat on that person’s ability. But there could still be room for egalitarianism and to distribute more towards the lower skilled workers. Do you think I’m getting anything wrong in my thinking?",t3_a3rhdy,communism

"That's not an accurate characterization. The Trotskyist position is that revolution in predominately feudal societies should be led by the proletariat regardless of its size and prominence, even somewhere like China where the proletariat was just a few hundred thousand urban workers among hundreds of millions of peasants. History has shown this view to be probably incorrect. While proletarian movements ultimately succeeded in both China and the former Russian Empire, the hard-fought battle against the aristocrats and bourgeoisie was won by the blood of peasants, not proletarians. By the end of the Russian and Chinese civil wars, so much had been destroyed that there was little industrial capital left for the proletarian movement to assume. The greatest task of both these new governments was to rapidly industrialize and turn these peasants into proletarians, hoping to do the work of the capitalists while avoiding the miseries of bourgeois rule. In the Soviet Union this was quite effective, however in China some industrialization efforts backfired and the Chinese Communist Party liberalized the economy to develop capital after Chairman Mao's death. Contrast this with the 'stagist' view advanced by Stalin and Karl Radek, which was that proletarian ascension must be preceded by some period of bourgeois dominance. My own assessment is that political leadership of a country (aristocratic versus bourgeois) does not matter much for the success of a revolution, as long as *the economy* is capitalist in nature and a proletariat exists to seize it.",t3_aafrrj,communism

They dismiss the entirety of the struggles of the Soviets, the Chinese, they throw Cuba and Korea under the bus, and yet they do not consider this “sectarianism”. When they are correctly called out for abandoning the world communist movement and pushing the US state line, they turn around and accuse others of sectarianism in excluding their neocon foreign policy. They only seem welcoming because they compromise with capitalists and liberals to the extent where, at this point, there’s little line between them.

Even 70 year old tanks can survive near hits by a typical nuclear weapon. Anyways TL;DR of NUTS is major cities will probably be nuked but other than that most nuclear weapons will be used tactically against armies rather than cities.

Now, I have the opportunity to keep walking because he's not blocking my way but is only threatening to (by killing me). I also notice that the man tries to do this with other people, scares them, disturbs them. Do I debate with him? Do I keep walking? Or do I report to the state that this man should not be given the license to own a gun? Add another dimension that some of the people whom this man scares, have a family history of being injured/killed by such men. Do you expect them to forget their mental trauma and be all rational about it and try to debate with this man? Ideally, maybe yes we should debate. But even then how do you debate with people who do not believe in debate? I am not arguing that we find out all the people who read this content and report them.

Reider claimed the demonstrations could achieve dramatic change because they 'may challenge something even deeper than the occupation.' Hagai Mattar, a veteran anti-occupation activist and widely read journalist, echoed Reider's unbridled enthusiasm. 'For the first time in decades, perhaps, we are witnessing the impossible becoming possible,' Mattar wrote on the popular Hebrew website MySay. 'What appeared to be a mere fantasy half a year ago… has become a vivid reality.' And a similar attitude in the mainstream towards contradictory political positions coexisting: >As during the glory days of early socialist Zionism, Palestinians are isolated and ignored. 'It's a classic secular, Jewish and urban protest,' Tamar Herman, a political scientist at the Israel Democracy Institute, told the Associated Press. 'Arab participation would open the door to the divisive questions here.' While the Palestinian left did not: >Abir Kopty, a Palestinian rights activist from the northern Israeli city of Nazareth, is one the few Palestinians to have insinuated themselves into the main protest area on Rothschild. Kopty played a central role in the establishment of Tent 1948 and she is a major presence at Palestinian tent protests around the country. 'I've been a part of Tent 1948 not because I wanted to be part of J14,' Kopty told us. 'My role there is to challenge J14 and to tell them they can't have social justice without addressing issues like occupation. So I refuse to be a part of J14. I'm only there to challenge and to assert my Palestinian identity.' >Despite her prominent role, Kopty agreed with Youssef Hassan that the movement was exploiting her presence to burnish its social justice image. 'I'm aware that they're using me but it doesn't matter because in the world [the July 14 movement] won't receive any real support unless they address the Palestinian issue and the occupation,' Kopty said. 'Palestinians aren't really a part of J14 anyway because they generally didn't go to Rothschild to set up tents. Instead they are setting up tents in their own neighborhoods just to say, 'Hello, we are here.'' >But could the July 14 protests initiate a process that will eventually lead to the unraveling of the occupation and discrimination against Palestinians, as many on the Israeli left have suggested? 'The injustice will continue,' Kopty declared flatly. 'And I don't believe J14 will create changes that are socio-political. But our struggle is completely political. So when J14 finally explodes because the different internal groups have contradicting interests -- and they can't remain apolitical forever -- our struggle will go on.' We can even use that as a case study into what will happen  >It may not have changed the fact that those who led the government then are still in charge today. It didn’t even change Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s basic way of thinking about the economy and society, and it didn’t change the relative amounts spent on civilian social services as a percentage of GDP. These have all remained as they were. That's expected not only because by ignoring the central issue of apartheid and colonial wealth extraction, the left was doomed before it started, but even in its orientation as a broad left-liberal coalition it could not fathom that neoliberalism is not a choice of greedy capitalists but a necessity to counter the falling rate of profit. Meanwhile the occupation continues. Contrast that with the recent statements by American communist organizations. This is not to condemn them necessarily but rather ask what is the difference? To me the difference is clear: while the facts of apartheid, super-exploitation, and a broadly racist settler aristocracy are clear in Israel they are hidden in France. The French protests are a 'French' issue while the neocolonial status of Libya, Morocco, Algeria, etc is considered separate. This is an epistemological problem and not merely a political one, since we do not even have the tools to think outside of nation states at the same time capitalism is dissolving these borders. There are no newspapers which treat the entire value chain of French commodity production as a single unit nor do we have any political or legal forms which treat export of raw materials from Libya and their final sale in France under the same framework. Libyans cannot vote in French elections nor do they have any legal rights except as refugees for the poor or as citizens for the rich. This is not the world of politics as it appears to our eyes but the essence that lurks behind the form of the commodity and it is changing the nature of our world whether we have the conceptual tools or not. The left, the right, and the center are all built from the previous model of national politics (even though it was already fundamentally flawed as dependency theory showed), now capitalism has finally begun to make real what was already implicit in the 'shift to the East' Lenin and even Kautsky foretold (hence the collapse of even the 'labor aristocratic' Eurocommunist organization if you accept that analysis). But the fact of Israeli social democratic politics being founded on super-exploitation, which is clear to the first world left precisely because Palestine is the last 'national liberation' type struggle left from the previous epoch (and therefore is legible within the post-colonial hegemonic ideology that absorbed that challenge) compared to the protests in France to me are a matter of quantitative difference, not qualitative. As more and more of the world is thrown into systematic chaos as the current configuration of capitalism dies and another takes its place, the differences between the colonial apartheid of Israel and the apartheid of national borders that keep the masses of the third world out of French borders will become less and less clear. e: that is not to say that the French protests are far right. As the article I linked makes clear, neo-colonialism is not a political concept at all since it constitutes the political possibilities for all sides. The far right is still a fraction of the French and Israeli population (though racism is norm among the population as a whole) which happens to be politically influential as all other political possibilities for implementing neoliberalism have become delegitimized. The question is not whether the politics being contested are left or right (clearly both and neither with the social democratic left being the majority) but rather what issues cannot be considered 'political' in the first place.

"I've heard of the allegations of conspiracy. Certainly very interesting! Not really my line of discussion, but interesting to read passively! Regards to Lenin, I find him more honest compared to Deng. He declared outright that the NEP was a conscious step backwards, while Deng put the market reforms as a step forwards. Of course one can also argue that a strategic step backwards in the long run can be seen as a step forwards. But to be honest I think its hard to compare because I think there are other reasons at play. As we discussed the material causes are more important than individual decisions. But what is a 'step forward' or a 'step backward'? A step forward helps us build socialism. A step backward prevents us from building socialism. In 1921, doing the NEP helped build socialism, and not doing it would have stunted the development of socialism. It seems counterintuitive, but in reality the debate is not between do we want an NEP or full socialism, but rather do we want to survive with an alliance with the peasantry, or do we want to do civil war between the proletariat and the peasantry (the peasantry having the numbers and the guns) and lose all we have fought for? One is a step forward in the long run, the other is a step backward, even though ultras will ultra.",t3_a5uuwt,communism

"It's looking more and more like Syria will eventually go to war with Turkey, which is concerning. The US removing all troops from Northern Syria will allow Turkey to invade and occupy the territory currently held by the Kurds. Ergodan has already declared that Turkey will begin to push their army east of the Euphrates in a matter of days, and they also have moved troops to the southern border of jihadist-held territory as a show of force and have exchanged shelling with the Syrian Arab Army west of the Euphrates over the past week or so. The Kurds have been left to be destroyed after they were used to further US imperialism, which was to be expected. Overall this doesn't look good for Syria, as the US will undoubtedly support Turkey in the inevitable conflict. I hope I'm wrong though. Also, Trump's justification that ISIS has been defeated within Syria isn't true. ISIS is on its last leg, yes, but they still hold a small amount of territory and a few villages in Syria, so I believe that his justification is just a smokescreen for abandoning their Kurdish proxy force because Turkey's annexation of Northern Syria will be stronger militarily than that of the Kurds. As a 'bonus,' the US has already built bases in Northern Syria, so they don't have to spend any money building them for Turkey- the Turkish forces will just take them over!",t3_a7mrge,communism

"A lot of interesting material here, much of with I am in total agreement with. As I outlined above, I don't really agree with most of the criticisms outlined above (outlined by a Maoist/by Maoists, not by Mao or the CCP), especially the stuff on the 'cult of personality' or shortcomings in Stalin's philosophy, as both of these criticisms are rooted in idealism. Before proceeding, I'll recopy my two points from above that I believe are the most serious and genuine criticisms of the Stalin era: paternalism in political life; the dissolution of the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. The masses were alienated from political life, which is one of the hallmarks of bourgeois governance. It is no surprise then that bourgeois ideas would emerge dominant. And Coming back to the standard of living of the peasantry, there's another serious criticism here. Similar to the bourgeois characteristics of governance mentioned above, the prioritizing of urban development over rural development is a characteristic of bourgeois economic and social development as well. Likewise, it should be no surprise in this situation that bourgeois ideas emerged dominant. Just wanted to make sure we're on the same page about what I argue vs what the authors at massline argue. You could argue he didn't set up a broad enough infrastructure or a policy of contingency that was necessary for the party and state to prevent 'revisionists' taking over the Central Committee, but unless you have a practical, material explanation for why he couldn't or didn't do so outside of personal ideology, it isn't relevant as a critique. I'm with you so far. Workers' Soviets or mass lines can help, but as a general policy, they often become a catchall not acknowledging that being more directly democratic doesn't resolve every contradiction, primarily with economic efficiency, uneven development (internal and external), party discipline, rational bureaucracy, ideological centralization, scientific advancement, and intensive production. The criticism that there wasn't enough 'democracy' is more Trotskyist and doesn't really reflect the nuances of the criticisms I myself am proposing. Democracy is more than institutions. Real proletarian democracy must exist dialectically with other parts of society. To have elected leadership in workplaces or governance is one thing. To have a culture that interacts with the economic and political institutions to foster further empowerment to keep the struggle going is necessary. This comes back to the paternalistic role of the Party. It tended to make decisions for the masses, rather than teach the masses how to make the right decisions themselves. And this criticism is certainly exaggerated and more generalized than real political life under Stalin really was, because it was not a uniform monolith. There were forces at play, etc. etc. Communities are inherently competitive with others and reactionary in outlook, and they have to be given suggestions and eventually clear guidance, obviously by taking into account their perspectives, but not by expecting some 'hidden wisdom' of the common people. Getting that balance is harder than just 'listening to the people' and 'relying on their pressure.' Of course, and the mass line is not tailism. We don't rely on hidden wisdom of the masses when we follow the mass line. It's about having that relationship. I read a book once, *La construction du socialisme en Chine*. The focus is not on the comparison between the Soviet Union and the PRC, but there was a brief part dedicated to the cadre structure. If I remember correctly (really should have taken some notes), the authors found that concerning state planning, in the USSR, cadres would go conduct their analysis and bring it back to the Party, whereas in China there was a preliminary step where the masses would essentially conduct their own analysis and bring their requests to the Party, talk about what was needed where, when, etc., concerning capital investment, infrastructure, you name it. It's a small thing, and I'm not suggesting this minor difference in their state planning caused China to survive revisionism, but it is indicative of a difference between what a mass line looks like vs the paternalism of the CPSU. To repeat my first point, the Maoist argument can easily be reversed: the fixation on participatory democracy doesn't acknowledge the necessities of rational bureaucracy and technological gaps with the West, nor their complex relations. If the primary contradiction is imperialism, relying on the masses can help, but over-relying on poor and overworked people who are just becoming educated and ideological, and expecting their popular pressure to always dissuade 'revisionists' (as if 'revisionists' winning over the army and police doesn't basically guarantee their victory, as Lenin would argue) from capitalist restoration is itself a non-dialectical outlook that obscures the class politics of geopolitics. There were leaders in the Central Committee who planned to turn China into 1990s Russia, and there were leaders who planned for its greater independence and ongoing success. The basis of post-Maoist Thought in China is basically catching up with the West in every necessary metric by synthesizing Chinese and European forms of planning, managing, and regulating with Chinese and European forms of entrepreneurship, market competition, and 'self-management.' Contemporary Maoism, mostly by obscuring it, does a disservice to the mass levels of central planning, rational bureaucracy, party regulation, educational investment, and technological development that is done in modern China (and that could not be done without each of those checking and balancing each other). You can't even have a 'mass line' if you don't balance it with everything else that is necessary. Absolutely! State planning is a complex phenomenon. And I'm with you on the idea that the problems of participatory democracy. The issue I take is, as outlined above, that the mass line is not tailism or 'socialism with more direct democracy.' It's not about letting the masses make the decisions. It's about incorporating the masses into the project so that they can make their own decisions. Perhaps my criticism of the USSR is unfounded (or founded in ignorance, in which case, please share, I will listen and correct my line accordingly). Perhaps my criticism is simply exaggerated in importance. But my criticism is not that the USSR should have had more direct democracy. This, again, is rather Trotskyist. My criticism (and it's not just mine, as you know) is that the USSR could have and should have incorporated the masses into the process, whereas their formal decision making was more paternalistic than democratic. It's about a dialogue between the masses and the Party, not one dominating the other. Stalin's geopolitical paternalism was based in the fact that the USSR was the most ideologically advanced socialist state (as a former Yugoslav, it's clear to me that Stalin's line was right in 1948) and his caution was based in trying to achieve the basic survival of the world socialist project, as it was clearly dependent on the USSR (as it is with contemporary China). And as far as I'm concerned, the insane amounts of ungratefulness that the world as a whole has towards the sacrifice of the USSR (including in my native Yugoslavia) counteract that paternalism. And the cautiousness of the present Chinese leadership is primarily why they have my trust. I'm with you. As I mentioned, many Comrades don't know how to do foreign policy. If they were in charge, they'd be bombed into oblivion. The paternalism I mentioned was not with regards to Stalin's foreign policy towards other socialists, but internally towards the masses. The caution he held in his foreign policy was immense and entirely understandable, if we are not dogmatists. Yet Maoists and other ultras and purists will still claim that Stalin wanted the Chinese revolution to fail. If I remember correctly (or according to Albert Szymanski), replacing heavy industry with light industry and nationwide wage equalization (including greater access to public goods and services) was standard policy after Stalin. That near-total equality didn't save the Soviet Union. I don't know if this is in response to me or to the author(s) at Massline. I myself didn't say that wage equalization would save anyone, that sounds like more ultra bs. My line was on the importance of the relationship between the town and city.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"okay i was expecting more economic type stuff but thats fine. I personally dont go too deep into these kind of historic arguments because it just seems fallacious to me to say this bad thing happened in the ussr therefore communism is bad. the other big problem is that its heavily clouded by cold war propaganda, and while historians have come around on many points the general public's opinion hasnt budged. One more thing is that it wasn't entirely homogenious, some soviet states had problems that others didnt, for example its my understanding that albania had some really big problems with, as you put it, freedom of information, and while you can definitely find stories of it from all around it wasn't this totalitarian anything-you-say-means-gulag stuff. The most common thing that liberally-inclined people would take issue with was punishing anti-communist 'propaganda' through the exile system which basically would say 'you aren't allowed to go to the X biggest cities in the ussr'. So if one is really big on freedom of speech obviously they would not like that, but it's hardly a death camp type situation. its important to remember that the situation in the early ussr was pretty fucked, they had come out of civil war and a world war which they lost, as well as sustained domestic counter-revolutionary activity (forgive the commie jargon) from anarchists and reactionaries, including foreign interference and lack of cooperation in the global market. Famine was also sometimes an issue at this point in history (around the world). So when we look at deaths by far the #1 cause was starvation, and that extends to gulags as well. To sum the collectivization up, basically what happened was the government said to kulaks (to oversimply, major farm land owners) 'okay, you produce X grain in a month, we will come in one month and collect Y grain, where Y is the majority of the surplus beyond whats needed to supply yourselves, reproduce this output again next month and maybe grow a little or whatever'. Again, obviously liberals wont like that but thats an ideological point that needs its own whole conversation. to make it simple, there wasn't enough food and a tiny fraction of people had control of most of it which would not be allowed by a communist state. Many kulaks decided to not produce as much grain as they could but only enough for themselves, government took what it said it would anyway. Others decided to, while the rest of the country/union was starving, burn their crops, raze fields and slaughter their livestock (and we're talking like tens of millions of animals) so that the state couldnt take it. this situation lead to significantly worsened famine conditions and many more deaths, but also lead to a swift, state power based collectivization of farm land. This was the bloodiest period of soviet history, its rumored that stalin's wife committed suicide over it. I hope that adds a bit of nuance to it. The extent of what I want to establish is that the ussr can't be reasonably compared to something like nazi germany which commit violence for the sake of violence or racial purity or whatever fascist shit. The history of communism was not like that even though it obviously had some major issues and instances of violence (keep in mind liberal societies did/do as well). and just to add on, in all likelihood if he used numbers in the video they're likely incredibly inaccurate. the big meme number is 100 million dead to communism around the world, which comes from the black book of communism and uses incredibly fallacious methods like saying dead people could have had kids and therefore amount to more than 1 death directly blamed on communism, or counting nazi soldiers killed by soviet soldiers in ww2. if this happens to be incredibly interesting to you there's a good podcast ",t3_a35ymz,communism

"In my opinion it's a basic imperialist proxy war very similar to the ones in the Balkans of the early XX century. I gotta disagree with you there comrade, Putin didn't create the oligarchy, on the contrary the oligarchy, i.e. the bourgeoisie, is the ruling class and it chose Putin as its representative. Russia's policy towards Ukraine is imperialistic as it has 1) annexed Crimea (even tho the population actually supported that move) 2) supported the civil unrest and armed conflict in the East (again, even tho the people actually were against the post-maidan power) and then betrayed the rebels leaving them in the horrible situation like that of Transinistria, and you know there were real communist brigades (as far as I know) and charismatic leaders who, if they organized the upset and armed local people might've been a threat to the local capitalists and Russia's imperialists' interests in the region, so they were mostly cleaned out too. I don't think this can become a full blown war between the two states because that's just unnecessary and also there's the NATO bloc and the EU who have their own imperialistic interests in Ukraine such as cheap labour force and natural resources, they just won't let Russia annex Ukraine even if it wanted to, but I suppose our capitalists are just happy with what they get from this situation: 1) cheap Ukrainian labour force 2) maximum support for the regime in 2014 3) intensified construction of the Blue Stream and Nord-Stream 2 4) higher gas export prices for Ukraine and the EU, if I'm correct. And Russia is still Ukraine's main source of import. So my general view of this is that the RF is acting as a second class imperialist power would, and Ukraine is an object of severe exploitation by the local and world bourgeoisie, and the people are suffering on both sides because of that.

"I'm just gonna add on the last little bit, because I think it was important. 'The one who has not led an investigation does not have the right to speak,' wrote Mao Zedong, correctly. This work of investigation is the only one which can permit us to open our mouths about putting out a correct line. We consider that we have the obligation to hold a correct line, even rudimentary, as it relates to the entirety of the debates which agitate society. Even if this line is to say that we don't yet have the information to judge. This is the work of a communist organization, to provide key points of analysis into struggle. We cannot boycott the struggles. But a line is not enough. It must also be an action towards society, to have a praxis towards the fact, even, or phenomenon. Therein, again, among those who condemn the Yellow Vest movement, who point their finger at it, resides a question. Some could say, 'these protests are far-right, we hunt them from our ranks, we are not going to theirs.' This position appeared to us to be the cornerstone of the paradox. Either, the movement is irredeemably reactionary, just as the 'Protest for All' may have been, and in this case, it should be attacked, it's ranks dispersed, etc., or it is not entirely reactionary, and so in this case, a policy must be lead the struggle for a line, and, at a minimum, break off the most advanced and least reactionary elements from the movement. In any case, it requires action. However, we remark that nothing has been taken up by the most vehement opponents to begin to materialize their analysis. And for that reason, we think they've been hypnotized by the outbreak of something that, to them, seemed completely foreign: the popular masses, in their variety, in their strength as in their weaknesses. And faced with that, these organizations and individuals have capitulated. ___ I just wanted to add this, because it seemed to bring the thesis to a head.",t3_a34zcu,communism

"I didn't say that in my comment, no. I do believe that imperialism is the natural outgrowth of capitalism, if that's what you're asking.

And, since I assume this is your point, I do think countries which identify as socialist are capable of being (social) imperialist, as evidenced by the Soviet Union.

"The apparel industry isn't inherently capitalistic, it just currently exists under capitalism. I also think there is often a misconception that if fashion is not strictly utilitarian it is inherently 'bourgeois' or antisocialist, which is absolutely not the case! Decorative goods certainly can (and have) been produced under socialism before, and by extension art can be used to further a socialist cause. That being said, I'd recommend learning to make your own clothes if you're interested, not because a good leftist 'should' or because you'd be a 'better person' if you did, but I am just suggesting it because for me personally, learning to do so can change your entire outlook on buying clothing! Before I started learning sewing, I used to buy so many more clothes than I needed (mainly because I used shopping as a form of escapism and 'retail therapy', but also because I held an intrisic value in things I could ''never make''. but after learning how to sew, and eventually gaining the ability to make virtually anything I wanted, I just sort of... lost the urge to buy anything at ..all. 'Why buy this when I can just make it?' I said. And of course, I almost never made it because I never wanted it **that** much to bother to, and as a result I stopped buying clothes! Something about having the power of creating things yourself trivializes the value of these commodities as collectable 'art' and renders them... things you could've made yourself anyway, if you wanted to, and yet have been made instead under much worse conditions. I also recommend thrifting if you're on a budget, it may not be a revolutionary act but it keeps money out of the hands of sweatshop owners and helps slow down the wheel of consumption a bit in everyday life. Though of course, the average worker is not *responsible* for the conditions goods are made under, and this rhetoric often shifts blame of the true orchestrators of how goods are produced, the bourgeois class.

(Source: Liberation, 4th of december) &#x200B; So I tell my point again, these are absolutely not 'regular France protests'. These are the stronger protests we've seen since 1968, and that's a year we'll always remember in France for protests. That's the year a government fell apart because of the protests. That's the year they sent the army against the protests. There's a lot more people badly injured. In my city, someone lost an arm, and in the city I was born in, a 16 year old had been shot in the head with a rubber ball. A 80s old woman died in Marseille because of tear gas. That's already more injured people than for the labour laws. We did not have a dead at a protest since Remi Fraisse, and this was 5 years ago and a very big case when this happened. &#x200B; The police had been rewarded with a big bonus by the government (the major police unions answered to that 'before bonuses, please pay our extra hours'.) The biggest (and the most conservative) police union stated that the country was in a 'pre insurrection state', and the protests are still going on. Usually in France, protests go quieter when you're not on a 'protest day', the big side of the protest is usually on the Thursday, but the protests are still going on, with no day of break since last Saturday.

"I don't buy into the theory of 'Soviet state capitalism' and I think calling it 'capitalist ideology' because it lead to restoration is itself reductive. Not speaking from a position of authority, but the reason I call the Khrushchevite (and later) reforms as capitalist ideology, rather than a restoration of capitalism, is because it made state enterprises follow the law of value, etc. etc. Amin called it capitalism without capitalists, and this seems apt, although I may be misunderstanding the nature of the reforms. On the other hand, the Chinese reforms seem to be paradoxically broader and allowing more private economy, yet without sacrificing the dictatorship of the People. The three base paths in 1953 were immediate restoration (Beria), gradual reform (Khruschev), or complete conservatism (Molotov). Thank you for sharing this. I've said before that had the USSR been able to reform to the left, that perhaps its demise would have been avoided. And perhaps even if the reforms of the eighties were leftist instead of rightist, there was still a possibility to be redeemed. But as you mention, there was no left alternative. The farthest left was Molotov, who was certainly better than the alternatives, but not really able to respond to the demands of the revolution. I don't want to be playing 'whataboutism' or sheer speculation, but I imagine that if Molotov had come to power, it would have just kicked the can down the road. You're not a Maoist, but your view does seem always to shift into their skepticism that Soviet democracy was formal, but not dynamic. And Chinese democracy possibly was or is just more dynamic, but I don't think that's why Deng preserved China, unless, through that mass work, he did get insights from debating Mao, studying Chinese history and listening to the peasant masses (I recommend you to try to find the roots of his anti-imperialism and how that was made standard in the Central Committee). The criticisms being leveled (by myself and Amin) are not exclusive to Soviet democracy, but can be applied similarly to Chinese democracy as well to some extent, and much of 20th century socialism. There may be varying degrees of dynamics in each specific country, but the criticism of the Marxist Leninist model is not exclusive to the Soviet Union. I think the argument is rather that the Chinese revolution relied on the masses more, such that they were engaged enough to put pressure on their government and prevent it from restoring capitalism. What does it mean for the Soviet leadership under Stalin to be distinctly proletarian? You mean they were raised in proletarian milieus? Gained legitimacy through making proletarian revolution? That it had proletarian class character and ideology? I don't really know what it refers to when you say it. The CC of the CCP was/is professional. As mentioned, the criticisms of the Soviet model are not exclusive to the Soviet Union. What it means for the party leadership to not be professional is not to say that there isn't advanced leadership capable of leading, but that it should not necessarily be their primary role in society. I recognize that you need someone capable of making immediate decisions, but to the extent possible, it would be preferable for as much of the leadership as possible to also engage in production, in part in order to foster a proletarian/People's mindset and ideology. This has existed in varying degrees in some socialist countries, but it should be a standard, in order to mitigate the inevitable distance between the Party and the People. We may say that the contradiction between the Party and the People should be non-antagonistic. But if the Party and the People were the same, there would be no contradiction at all. Perhaps it is utopian, but measures can be taken to make the contradiction as non-antagonistic as possible. This makes a lot of sense, but I can't explain why. The Trots may essentialize the idea, but it is valuable as a framework. Your primary question of 'what is the origin of revisionism?' is definitively more mature and relevant than what we get from Trots or ultras, but it can fall into that trap. It's the difference between moral condemnation and neutral study. I don't ask the question in order to bash Stalin or anything. I want to learn from Stalin. The former is opportunistic. The latter is Marxist. I do think that you should look into where Deng's anti-imperialism came from. I always thought it was just because he was a communist. I try not to focus on why certain individuals hold certain beliefs, because it is often fraught with trouble, but rather to ask why the ideas exist and gain prominence in certain social conditions. I strongly try to avoid the 'Great Men' narrative of history. Even Stalin favored that compromise (according to Geoffrey Roberts) before it was clear that the Moscow Conference was failing to unify the Germanys and the Marshall Plan was guaranteeing U.S. productive monopoly and intensive dominance in the near future. Yes, which is why I don't think it's appropriate to say that the changes in Soviet policy came about due to the succession of Stalin by the 'wrong' guy. The change in policy started with Stalin, and the end of the War seems to be the dividing moment. It's possible that the war had a greater influence on Soviet ideological leadership than Great Men theorists claim. The question is how to win them over, and to study how it has been done, and whether it can be turned into a method (not universal, but like what appeals work? what frameworks, language, compromises?). And aside from the theoretical basics that they need to be won over, I don't think we can say how, except on a case by case basis. The compromises needed (and I hesitate to even call them compromises, because they benefit both sides a ton – the bourgeoisie and market forces can contribute a ton, in its own right, under proper leadership) will vary from country to country and region to region. If I misrepresent his views or yours, then that is my fault and not his or yours. I haven't yet read his work on Maoism or China, but more so his work on Africa, liberalism, and Eurocentrism. I always read into what people say. It's a tic of mine. I appreciate you taking credit for your mistake, but my framing of discussion has been conducive to the misrepresentation, since I don't represent the whole nuanced character of Amin, but only the part that is relevant to express where I deviate from your views. But definitely read his work, if you can. Unfortunately most of the stuff that I've found most insightful doesn't exist in English, but you could definitely get his 2014 (?) book on Russia, you would really like it, I think. Russia and the Long Transition from Capitalism to Socialism. And the 2013 article I linked about China is a good introduction to his comments on China, with more to be found in other works (French that I know of). His book of reflections on the CPE during Nasser is also fascinating, but I don't believe it exists in English, unfortunately, because it's my favorite book by him to date! Edit: still unable to find *Egypte, nassérisme et communisme : diversité des socialismes* in English, although I did find it in his bibliography for his book *Reawakening of the Arab World*, which I have in my kindle library waiting to be read. I plan to read it, but most of the interesting theoretical stuff does not pertain to Egypt itself, but two main ideas: the role of the bourgeoisie in People's Democracy (I cited this in our second thread), and the dialectical relationship between unity and diversity. For that reason, I doubt the theoretical stuff would be the parts being cited in the book on the Arab world. Edit 2: looking for other Amin quotes I have saved, I stumbled across this interesting nugget concerning the roots of revisionism in the USSR: 'Because of some of its own historical limitations, Leninism had unwittingly prepared the groundwork for this fatal choice. I mean that Leninism had not broken radically with the economism of the Second International (of the Western labor movement, it must be said): its concept of the social neutrality of technology is evidence of this. A society embarking on a long transition faces contradictory demands. On the one hand, it must catch up, in the plain and simple sense of developing the productive forces. On the other hand, in its tendency toward socialism a society in transition offers the alternative of building a society free of economic alienation. The latter characteristically sacrifices the two sources of wealth: the human being reduced to labor power and nature regarded as the inexhaustible object of human exploitation. Can it be done? I always thought the answer was yes, but with great difficulty: a pragmatic compromise to move gradually in the promising direction of the alternative. The economism of Leninism contained the seed of a choice that would gradually make the goal of catching up triumph over the goal of the alternative.' According to this quote, it seems Amin is saying that revisionism came from prioritizing catching up over building an alternative. I don't know if it's true, but it's thought-provoking. I used to agree with this, but I've started to question it, seeing the development of the productive forces as part of the alternative, because the current reality is a non-development of the productive forces. Thus, developing the productive forces can only happen as part of an alternative, and an alternative can only exist if it develops productive forces. Food for thought. Interestingly enough, while I used to accept this possible root of revisionism (as my former utopian self, only caring about the social question), I used to reject the idea that the unity-diversity and proletariat-peasantry contradictions could be supported. I guess I've flipped a bit.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

" 'Whoever expects a “pure” social revolution will never live to see it. Such a person pays lip-service to revolution without understanding what revolution is. ... The socialist revolution in Europe cannot be anything other than an outburst of mass struggle on the part of all and sundry oppressed and discontented elements. Inevitably, sections of the petty bourgeoisie and of the backward workers will participate in it—without such participation, mass struggle is impossible, without it no revolution is possible—and just as inevitably will they bring into the movement their prejudices, their reactionary fantasies, their weaknesses and errors. But objectively they will attack capital, and the class-conscious vanguard of the revolution, the advanced proletariat, expressing this objective truth of a variegated and discordant, motley and outwardly fragmented mass struggle will be able to unite and direct it, capture power, seize the banks, expropriate the trusts which all hate (though for different reasons!), and introduce other dictatorial measures which in their totality will amount to the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the victory of socialism.” - Lenin Their demands will inevitably bring the protesters into conflict with capital and the bourgeois state, as it has already started to. The 'leftists' who are crying about some reactionary demands raised by the movement don't understand revolution. If the left decides not to support the protests, the far-right will, and they will be able to imprint their demands on the movement.

"If you're looking for a material basis for reform in China, you may be on to something. Revisionism was more of a Soviet phenomenon, also for material reasons. 1) Just look at the steel production of China in 1976 it was just 21,000 tons per annum while Poland which had a much much smaller population had an output of 17,000 tons . That gives 0.00049 tons per capita for Poland and 0 .000024 tons for China. Thats a 20 fold difference. How could China compete with that kind of backwardness? Yes, the development of the productive forces was one of the primary reasons for reform. 2) After the Sino/Soviet split, where would China get modern technology to improve its productive capacity? Just look how the US is trying to destroy Huawei and ZTE right now. Even now there is a ban by the US for exporting lithographic technology to China, so that China doesn’t become self sufficient in making computer chips. Would China redevelop or reinvent everything, that’s hardly realistic. The soviets had industrialised by exporting grain and buying technology from the West, they were blessed enough to exploit the largest capitalist economic crises to date ie the Great Depression. Western companies were hungry for orders because the western markets where in the depths of a depression. There was no such crises in the 1970s. Besides in the depths of the Cold War and having just lost in Vietnam would America had allowed history to repeat it self? Also all other countries like the US, Japan and South Korea all industrialised by importing capital from abroad. The Soviets were the exception. There's some truth to this, but it's not just a Chinese phenomenon, it's a strategic problem that all nations of the South must face, socialist or not. The necessity for the development of the productive forces is too often overlooked by first world leftists. 3) The US and its allies, were in a much better position. They had a long time to develop, Britain financed all of its industrialisation by colonial plunder, they were growing even richer each passing day by exploiting all the third world by unequal exchange, imperialist plunder, FDI returns etc. Plus the US mainland was not touched by any of the World Wars unlike China. How could China remotely compete with Imperialism in such a situation? Absolutely. The imperialist countries were able to develop self-centered economies, a precondition for modernization. But the imperialist countries doing such has made it impossible for the rest of the world to modernize according to the same model used by the imperialists. 4) The more China would fall behind, the more the populace would ascribe the failure to develop to socialism rather than on Imperialism. The intelligentsia might see Japanese and South Korean development and would start favouring capitalism. The CCP would have had lost power, a colour revolution financed by the West would have had more chances to succeed (Tiananmen Square).. This is legitimate too. The reforms were ushered in by the Party at the demands of the people, not at the expense of the people. The People knew change had to come. And yes, to maintain legitimacy, the CCP has to serve the people, not just to impose a carbon copy of the communist manifesto or something. 5) After the Volcker Shock, when the rate of profit precipitously declined in the west, Imperialism became even more vicious. This is when Neo-Liberalism starts and also when the US went on an orgy and assassinated many third world socialist leaders ( Sankara, Allende, Bhutto etc). Perhaps Imperliasm might even had directly attack China, or attempted to encircle it? Yep. Making some concessions can help prevent imperialism from completely destroying your country, but it's a dangerous road to go down, because if you concede too much, you're left with nothing. Of course I would prefer for it not to happen. I don't know why. The notion of necessary evils is rather moralistic and idealistic. If it's necessary for the progress of human civilization, then we do it. The question of revisionism in the USSR is just as complex and interesting, full of lessons for today, and is more of a degradation than it was in China. In China reform worked wonders. In the USSR, the reasons are entirely different.",t3_a5uuwt,communism
"The important distinction is that there are two kinds of police: Police the class, and Police the Civic authority. In Western countries like the US these are the same group of people, but it doesn't have to be so. Ultimately the rich are who have money and property worth taking so it greatly benefits them to have a stable, complacent population with a wall of armed soldiers to protect them. In times of unrest (say in a revolution) police will be put against the interests of the working class for the sake of pleasing the Bourgeois which is the theory behind why police as a class need to be abolished. The second reason is the historic violence and oppression by police officers of minorites, as police officers are most often from the majority ethic group of the area. This is bad because it leads to severe cases of racial profiling, and puts minorites in danger. In addition cops are all on the same team, so for you or I to go to then we are going to them as outsiders to their club. Have an issue with a cop? Good fucking luck getting another cop to help. Police or law enforcement in a communist society would be much more regulated, and as there is no class of power for them to bootlick, the idea iitd then possible to have an effective and fair agency.

But they withdrew medical help for at least 12 hours; the whole politburo, Beria among them, arrived at the scene instead of the doctors. He was the one who had said hours earlier, “Nothing has happened. You are panicking. The man is sleeping.” And then turned around and walked away. Richardson, Rosamond. Stalin’s Shadow. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1994, p. 248 “Beria certainly was very happy when my father died; he had always worked towards that. He had removed my father’s whole entourage, starting with Vlasik, who had been there 30 years. The doctor was arrested, the personal secretary was arrested, so something had been brewing there. I hate folklore and making guesses, but something was up.” “One of the guards attended the autopsy, Vlasik’s successor, a man named Krustalyov. They could not permit a post-mortem to go ahead unsupervised because by this time nobody trusted anybody. He sat there, and it made such an impression on him that afterwards he collapsed completely and drank heavily, and of course he was fired. He said that what hit him was when they opened the head, and he saw the brain.

Say a telemarketer calls and starts off with “how are you?” If the recipient of the call even answers the question, they are much more likely to listen to the rest of the call, and much more likely to sign up for or agree to something. Even when you get a free trial of something, most people feel instinctively obligated to give the company something in return.

"Most of the demands seem pretty moderate to me. A couple things to note. First, it says to prohibit taxation above 25%. That's obviously not helpful. Second, it says to break up the banks, whereas it would perhaps be more beneficial to nationalize them. There I'm nitpicking. Later it makes some weird claims about 'freedom,' it's not real sure what it's referring to, very vague, sounds like some bourgeois freedom about how the government is oppressing us all. Lastly, on immigration, it does not read like ending the cause of immigration. Their demand is: 'we can't support migrants, so let's not let them in.' Good to see them ending wars and pillage of Africa, although both of those things are presented in a Eurocentric and reductionist manner. I doubt anything would improve in that area if they got many of their other demands.

You can't expect everyone in an org like the PSL to be 100% on the same page on various side-strains of Marxism. I personally think there are a lot of issues with materialist feminism on a scientific level, and that should be explorable without explosive claims of misogyny. This clearly is a bad way of going about that, but tbh if the people involved were properly informed about 'horizontalism' and followed the guidelines on it this wouldn't be an issue, so it's weird to see that policy especially faulted. What the other person linked to in it went through is also not great but also... It's like, the guy in it is... I'll just say it, a loser. Clearly they need to self-critique but I still don't think it is some kind of horrific misogyny like it's presented.

"I don't disagree with the idea that Soviet political culture wasn't democratic enough, but I would say you have to have a materialist explanation for that. It did have broadly democratic institutions at the base of the government, but 'proletarian democracy' only seeped into the political culture during the civil war of the 1930s. Centralizing an ideology of proletarian hegemony is harder than setting up institutions. It needs a broad and deep social understanding of a particular society. It lasted in China, but not in Russia. It's better to find an explanation (the possibility that the leadership was exhausted by internal and external war, and was effectively coasting in the post-war years, or that these democratic experiments in centralizing proletarian ideology noticeably always lead to bloodshed in Russia and the government was attempting a type of social-political reform that could bring in the spirit of the working class without bringing back real conflict, or other similar observations) than to pretend there was a great divergence between Stalin and Mao. Your point about the cadre structure makes sense and actually contextualizes where broader potential differences could have developed between them. My only question is whether or not that was in the Stalin or post-Stalin period because I think it's likely that similar policies existed during the time the 25 was being sent to reorganize collective farming. I haven't yet read Lynne Viola's book (The Best Sons of the Fatherland, 1987), but I plan to, so I can get a better sense of that question. I already know scholars like Mark Tauger argue that's why collectivization ultimately worked. People adapted to new social realities and their ideology was then reworked (to an extent) by these changing social relations in production. 'It's not about letting the masses make the decisions. It's about incorporating the masses into the project so that they can make their own decisions.' 'It's about a dialogue between the masses and the Party, not one dominating the other.' Those are the kind of subtle distinctions that clears it up for me. You mean it's the social spirit of involvement in democratic institutions as opposed to a more functional involvement. I don't disagree that China has more of that than the Soviet Union did (at least after its prime). All I would say is not to draw hard conclusions for either country on that sense because we can't quantify that dialogue between the state and the masses. Pierre F. Landry cited the quantified direct local participation of China (relative to other countries) and it is among the highest in the world. It is actually higher than many of the cited Western 'democracies.' Finding more about that could give us a deeper sense of that spirit of involvement and dialogue, but I would stay cautious (as the Xi leadership is). The class struggle in China is aggressive and there are more than a few people in varying positions of power that would destroy it with neoliberalism if they ever gained the leverage (military leverage especially). I do agree that Stalin's foreign policy was traditional, as in it was not exactly based in class politics, but in basic self-preservation. I just don't judge the Soviet leadership on that question. And I genuinely recommend the book I mentioned by Marshall T. Poe. It's incredible how Russia has been under threat for literally centuries and basically forged its own political identity through that distinct need of self-defense. I've seen a good amount of these hyper-equalitarian criticisms before, and I guess I was presupposing your position. I just can't understand Trotskyists or Maoists who bring it up as the main issue. I must have misunderstood your point, but I was just saying greater formal equality or even (urban and rural) development would not have strengthened or preserved either the Soviet Union or People's Republic as state experiments. Contemporary China has disparities between city and town (I don't exactly know how the Chinese leadership is fixing that problem, but they have my general trust), but it's broader successes (including closing the wealth gap with the West) are more important, and there are more than a few comrades who argue that a lack of formal equality is the real problem underlying many socialist states and their 'failures.' I see no reason to believe that.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

Just as we've seen with the USSR, the DPRK and PRC, each of the varied culture(s) have had formative impacts on the characteristics of their socialisms, much the same would hold true for anyplace that would aspire to such a state of affairs, and neglecting to do so would likely be quite counterproductive.

"I don't think that any deliberate military actions undertaken by an imperialist power can be considered 'steps toward ending imperialism.' What we're seeing is a change in imperial priorities, as Trump decided that maintaining a presence in Northern Syria is less important than forestalling either a Turkish invasion or unification under the Assad government. Because Turkey is a secondary imperial power that seeks some permanent influence in Syria, they may just pick up where the USA left off and occupy northern Syria. This would most likely require gruesome military force and counter-insurgent suppression, tactics that were not employed in northern Syria because of the close relationship between the US and YPG. Unless Russia lends enormous aid to this situation, I'm not sure if the YPG and SAA together would be strong enough to resist Turkish incursion. The second option, unification, is the best immediate option for the people of Syria but is probably less likely, especially if Turkey occupies currently YPG-held territory. Syria's armed forces are not as well-equipped as Turkey's, and many foreign countries will be conspiring against a complete Syrian government victory.",t3_a86qi3,communism

"In October 1911, a royal railway nationalization proposal caused mass protests of rail workers across China. Several hundred nationalist rebels seized control of military outposts in Wuhan, killing or arresting several hundred Qing soldiers and proclaiming a Republican government that quickly spread east to Nanjing. Worrying that this revolt could spread to Beijing, the Qing court accepted a hasty agreement with nationalist leadership that gave popular general Yuan Shikai extreme power within China and inaugurated a 37-year period of political chaos within China. In March 1917 (February in the Russian traditional calendar) while Tsar Nicholas was away, a crowd of Petrograd factory workers ground down by World War 1 and centuries of Tsarist oppression halted work to demonstrate. Five days later, thousands of women joined the demonstration. Strikes shut down the entire Petrograd industrial economy. Detachments of soldiers turned these strikes into a rebellion, and within five days of the women's march effectively all soldiers in Petrograd had joined the revolt. That day, the royal family and Tsarist cabinet were arrested. Two days later, Nicholas formally abdicated and the 400-year Russian monarchy was abolished. What's the common factor here? Mass riotous activity scaring the shit out of an existing regime, and subsequent containment failures forcing abdication. The Bolshevik Party did not play a major role in the February Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party did not exist at the time of the Xinhai Revolution. Where there determination and tactics of these incredible groups mattered was well after this initial revolutionary push, when the overthrow of the old governments cleared the way for the communists (and other factions) to vie for power. All I'm saying is that this activity in France has some interesting similarities to revolutionary moments in the 20th century.

">To me the difference is clear: while the facts of apartheid, super-exploitation, and a broadly racist settler aristocracy are clear in Israel they are hidden in France. The French protests are a 'French' issue while the neocolonial status of Libya, Morocco, Algeria, etc is considered separate. The same can possibly be said about the United States and its relations with Latin American countries and other countries for that matter. There is disconnect in American politics between domestic and foreign policy as far as the general public goes. Yet, the US is now facing a domestic challenge, migrant caravans, that is the result of their foreign policy, supporting the 2008 Honduran coup. I doubt the general public will make those connections because as you said, there are no newspapers that will want to relate these issues or make them known.

"My * probably insufficient * understanding of their disagreement is that it stemmed from the question of when to end the NEP and begin collectivization. Bukharin and his ilk wanted to continue the NEP, essentially to allow the economy to develop further so as to be more certain that socialism would not fail. Stalin and his ilk thought that they had already reached a level of development that would allow for the building of socialism, and thus that they should begin collectivization. As far as I know, they both agreed that collectivization was the goal and that the NEP would have to end eventually, but Bukharin though that Stalin was putting the revolution at risk by starting too early and was compelled to act illegally. Bukharin would eventually admit that Stalin had been right as collectivization had succeeded and socialism was being built, but as he had been caught conspiring to overthrow the government he was a dead man no matter what.

"An excerpt from *Chapter I: China’s Socialist Revolution and Socialist Construction, part three, The Stages of Socialist Development, pages 13-17*: 3:The Stages of Socialist Development The two phases of communism are defined by Marx in his Critique of the Gotha Programme. In the lower phase, where the means of production are already owned by society as a whole, there is no longer any exploitation of man by man. Nevertheless, labour remains the measure of distribution of the means of subsistence under the principle, “from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.” In other-words, a certain amount of labour is exchanged for products turned out by an equal amount of labour. In the higher phase of communism, the above principle is replaced by that of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.” In 1956 and 1957, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce was basically accomplished in the country. The process remained incomplete in capitalist industry and commerce because capitalists still drew a fixed interest and a considerable number of joint state-private stores were responsible for their own profits or losses and in fact served as private dealers for state commercial departments. From 1967, fixed interest for capitalists was abolished and the above-mentioned state-private stores ceased being responsible for their profits or losses. Thus the bulk of industry came under ownership by the whole people, existing side by side with a predominant collective system of ownership by the working people in agriculture. The means of production in the collectively owned sector are common property of the working people in one particular collective or another but not that of the whole society. The products of a collective are distributed within its framework and not on a national scale. Socialism characterized by the co-existence of these two systems of public ownership is obviously different from what Marx defines as the first phase or lower phase of communism. It can only be regarded as the lower phase of socialism or immature, imperfect socialism At the same time, there should be no doubt about its being socialist because the means of production are publicly owned, either nationally or collectively, and exploitation is basically eliminated. The term “the transition from capitalism to communism” appears in Marx’s Critique of the Gotha Programme, Lenin’s State and Revolution, and other works. Over the years, the term has been misinterpreted as meaning the whole process of development from capitalism to the higher phase of communism – a view which has been widely accepted by Chinese theorists. This is clearly not the original meaning of the concept. The transition from capitalism to communism discussed by Marx and Lenin refers to the transition from capitalism to socialism or the first phase of communism. In The State and Revolution, Lenin clearly divides the process of growth of communist society into three stages: first, the transitions from capitalism to communism; second, the first or lower phase of communist society; and third; the second or higher phase of communist society. If the period of transition from capitalism to communism covers the attainment of the higher phase of communism, how can there be a lower phase of of communism after that? Since socialism is the lower phase of communism, Marx terms the transition from capitalism to socialism a transition to communism. In keeping with Marx’s formulation, Lenin pointed out in The State and Revolution: “What is usually called socialism was termed by Marx the “first” or lower phase of communist society. In so far as the means of production become common property, the word “communism” is also applicable here, providing we do not forget that this is not complete communism.” After the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin often called the transition from capitalism to communism a transition from capitalism to socialism. In his view, the two formulation has the same meaning. Marx points out that communism is divided into two phases and that socialism is the lower phase. Current history poses a new question to us: Should socialism also be divided into several phases? In a country with an extensive small peasant economy, we must first transform such an economy into a collective economy, and, after a considerably long time, transom the latter into an economy under the ownership by the whole people along with the growth of the productive forces. Before all means of production come under ownership by the whole society, there is a period in which two systems of socialist public ownership exist side by side. This is the lower phase of socialism, in which China now finds itself. Recognition of this point is highly important because it helps to prevent a premature application of certain principles applicable only to the first phase of communism defined by Marx. Collective ownership in China needs to be developed for a long time before it phases out. This is just like commodity production in the country, which will not vanish until after a period of considerable growth. The initial realization of agricultural mechanization will not be followed by an immediate, smooth transition to ownership by the whole people because vast differences in income will remain between regions, communes and production brigades and teams. Collective ownership will continue to exhibit its vigour and vitality for quite some time. It will be necessary for the rural areas and, to a certain extent, for the cities as well, to develop collective enterprises responsible for their own profits or losses that compete with enterprises under the ownership by the whole people. We should fully recognize the protractedness of the socialist period and its division into stages and should not be too anxious to cross over from one stage to another. If we try to do that, the growth of productive forces will suffer, much to the detriment of the consolidation of the socialist system and the transition to communism. A fully mature socialist society is distinguished mainly by its relations of production, namely, a unitary ownership by the whole people instead of the co-existence of two systems of socialist public ownership. The change is preconditioned by tremendous growth of the productive forces along with changes in the superstructure and a significant rise in the people’s income and in their cultural level. When socialism reaches full maturity, it will advance towards the second or higher phase of communism. The conclusion of the first phase may well be the beginning of the transition to the second. It may be necessary to complete in the second phase some tasks left from the first one in the same way as agrarian reform, a task left unfinished during the democratic revolution, had to be completed in the period of socialist revolution.",t3_a6az1r,communism

"I didn't say not to find where that vision came from (you could just read about the '' and contextualize the social-political background to their differences and growth), but I don't exactly know where to find it outside of looking at material realities or class backgrounds (which can be reductive if not handled carefully). I don't buy into the theory of 'Soviet state capitalism' and I think calling it 'capitalist ideology' because it lead to restoration is itself reductive. It could have been maintained by a whim as it was in 1953, and would likely have never lead to restoration, but stagnation. It probably could have happened if Molotov came to power, never being questioned or challenged on standard policy but not radically reforming policy either, and staying there until his death. In the late 1980s, then the restorationists could have their chance, but not if Chernenko lived another decade and the conservative Generals decided to take over the Central Committee (no one would have opposed them). The three base paths in 1953 were immediate restoration (Beria), gradual reform (Khruschev), or complete conservatism (Molotov). It was one of three choices, and they fought and then chose to reform gradually, to coast on the social perceptions of 'success,' handling the problems when they came (lack of intensive methods and technologies in production has been seen by many mainstream economists, such as Robert C. Allen, as the primary problem, as it is the primary problem with the U.S. economy, according to Robert Brenner). But what if the professionals spend their lives organizing and representing workers, rising from local chapters of informal unions to federations of centralized and party-regulated trade unions? Doesn't that by nature require mass education, dialogue, debate, election, and participation? You're not a Maoist, but your view does seem always to shift into their skepticism that Soviet democracy was formal, but not dynamic. And Chinese democracy possibly was or is just more dynamic, but I don't think that's why Deng preserved China, unless, through that mass work, he did get insights from debating Mao, studying Chinese history and listening to the peasant masses (I recommend you to try to find the roots of his anti-imperialism and how that was made standard in the Central Committee). The Soviet leadership (and party) was distinctly 'proletarian' for most of the Stalin period (according to T. G. Rigby), but it was replaced by literal professionals and managers following his death. That fundamental replacement could not have happened during Stalin's rule. That is an example of many random-chance changes, and the changing of party structure definitely changed the scale of urban-rural disparities, re-centralized policy to appease if not favor the interests of the peasantry, and had the leaders remain unwilling to address the need to outcompete imperialism at the level of intensive production (as companies from Japan, Germany, and now China have already outcompeted U.S. companies, effectively diminishing its manufacturing rate of profit since the 1970s and collapsing its wage scaling and welfare state in the process). Professionalism to me seems necessary. Was the Central Committee of the party in China 'unprofessional?' Does having more dialogue with workers and peasants not still require one to have an advanced ideology rooted in the basics of Marx and Lenin, so you can monitor and regulate them when necessary before you and others can convince them to change their line with those you've already won over (presuming the line is correct)? If anything, 'elitism' would be the problem, but that denies the party's proletarian class character, and how active and ideological it was in its prime (this is what I initially undermined in my own understanding). 'Back to 1917, a similar argument can be made that the ultimate failure of the Bolshevik Revolution to sustain itself was because its goals were too lofty and its perspective too advanced, looking too far into the future, was too progressive for its material conditions. It's worthy of more research, but it is certainly in line with the modern ML approach to analysis.' This makes a lot of sense, but I can't explain why. The Trots may essentialize the idea, but it is valuable as a framework. Your primary question of 'what is the origin of revisionism?' is definitively more mature and relevant than what we get from Trots or ultras, but it can fall into that trap. It could just be that I don't have a fundamental question I'm trying to answer. I just study and see where I end up. I do think that you should look into where Deng's anti-imperialism came from. 'I definitely agree that the Chinese have maintained a more thorough view of imperialism.' If we could answer the question of why they got it right that imperialism was the primary contradiction to negate and how their exact reforms and compromises could get them to intensive competition with the West, it could go back to answer the nature of Soviet 'revisionism,' which was distinctly non-imperialist, but not anti-imperialist, and by that, I mean always ready to cease the Cold War by making Eastern Europe 'neutral' and allowing a fundamental reform of Eastern Europe. Even Stalin favored that compromise (according to Geoffrey Roberts) before it was clear that the Moscow Conference was failing to unify the Germanys and the Marshall Plan was guaranteeing U.S. productive monopoly and intensive dominance in the near future. China doesn't have those 'client state responsibilities,' so that helps, and it is basically one country, but it has substantial minorities and allies to trade and develop with. China doesn't have to think about allowing Tibet or Xinjiang to reform and would never compromise them to foreign occupiers (as Gorbachev basically said okay to NATO Expansion in 1990). Those are differences to think about. 'And have been willing to work with internal bourgeois forces at times.' This is also important. Venezuela has it as a part of Bolivarianism. Winning over as much of the bourgeois and petit-bourgeois (as possible) to a 'temporary alliance' makes everything easier. The question is how to win them over, and to study how it has been done, and whether it can be turned into a method (not universal, but like what appeals work? what frameworks, language, compromises?). If I misrepresent his views or yours, then that is my fault and not his or yours. I haven't yet read his work on Maoism or China, but more so his work on Africa, liberalism, and Eurocentrism. I always read into what people say. It's a tic of mine. 'The simplification into binaries is a problem on my part, not on his.' I hounded on that point because I think contemporary scholarship implied that it wasn't in the worker or peasant masses where the 'real' conflict was, but in the leadership, and it did lead back to the lacking qualities in the leadership. I maybe take 'roots' not as seriously as I should, but you can either study the roots of post-Stalin foreign policy (maybe in Lenin's frameworks explaining the First World War or in Stalin's compromises in the early Cold War) and why it was what it was (like knowing to not engage in imperialist exchange and wealth concentration, but not knowing to maintain centralization as an instrument of producing surplus that could be used to invest in intensive production). Or just study Deng's writings and Xi's foreign policy (One Belt One Road is major), or study both and compare them, then you might find your answer about Soviet 'revisionism.' 'For example, he offers a more nuanced view of the current Chinese leadership than probably you or I would.'

As I said, I will read his work and possibly change my mind if I see ruptures in my own thinking.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"You will never make everyone happy, but it's essential to remember that left opposition to actually existing socialism is fomented by imperialist powers and that criticisms, even genuine, are elevated by the imperialist platform to create a general vector of left opposition which will distract the left from attacking Western intervention. Which is to say, that even though I might label chavismo as just dressed up peronism that seeks to use oil money only to perform social welfare without building a safe, socialist economy to defend the workers from capitalist exploitation and wrecking, this viewpoint is only going to be amplified in the West as a method to make supporting third world socialists untenable. This is a real crisis for socialists, because the line between self crit and useful idiocy is very difficult to navigate with the internet as a forum for discussion. How does the left actually have internal democracy? When is the left speaking outside itself and therefore using the centralist part of Democratic centralism? Our spaces are messy and imperialists come here to often, which is why the meme of having more open and nuanced discussions about Stalin and the cccp with other known socialists exists: you never know who you're talking to online, and you never know who's reading and why they might want to take your words out of context. Communists on the internet must always perform as agents of a party, following party line, even when having conversations within their own party. To be clear: having varying opinions about the tactics of socialist states from a perspective of effectiveness that considers the material reality of those decisions is not the same as simply attacking socialist states based on Western propaganda. Similarly, having debates on socialist tactics is not the same as allowing hate speech or exclusionary speech, which has no place in the left, regardless of how private the setting.",t3_a6ma8p,communism

"Thanks for detailed reply! Yes. The whole reason that led me to think this way was when I thought why does revisionism (market reforms) keep happening? Even the DPRK seems ready to introduce some market-elements now. Some people say that its because the wrong person got into power, but to me that seems like a very simplistic explanation. I mean in my opinion as Marxists we should be looking for material causes that cause people to become revisionist. I don't know if I support Deng though, when I saw the Cultural Revolution film 'How Yukong Moved the Mountains', it made me genuinely feel that a different world is possible, there was a genuine sense of community, not all of this narcism of modern society. It's sad to see all of that gone. I truly think it was the highest stage humanity has reached till now. But clearly there was a lot of backwardness too. Yes, the case of the USSR seems more complicated but over there too I think there were some other factors too. Marx while talking about how crime statistics have a regularly pattern: >Mr. A. Quételet, in his excellent and learned work, *l’Homme et ses Facultés*, says: >‘There is a *budget* which we pay with frightful regularity — it is that of prisons, dungeons and scaffolds.... We might even predict how many individuals will stain their hands with the blood of their fellow men, how many will be forgers, how many will deal in poison, pretty nearly the same way as we may foretell the annual births and deaths.’ >And Mr. Quételet, in a calculation of the probabilities of crime published in 1829, actually predicted with astonishing certainty, not only the amount but all the different kinds of crimes committed in France in 1830. That it is not so much the particular political institutions of a country as the fundamental conditions of modern *bourgeois*society in general, which produce an average amount of crime in a given national fraction of society, may be seen from the following table, communicated by Quételet, for the years 1822-24. We find in a number of one hundred condemned criminals in America and France: |Age|Philadelphia|France| |:-|:-|:-| |Under twenty-one years |19| 19| |Twenty-one to thirty Thirty to forty|44|35| |Thirty to forty|23| 23| |Above forty|14| 23 | |Total|100|100| &#x200B; >Now, if crimes observed on a great scale thus show, in their amount and their classification, the regularity of physical phenomena — if as Mr. Quételet remarks, ‘it would be difficult to decide in respect to which of the two’ (the physical world and the social system) ‘the acting causes produce their effect with the utmost regularity’ — is there not a necessity for deeply reflecting upon an alteration of the system that breeds these crimes, instead of glorifying the hangman who executes a lot of criminals to make room only for the supply of new ones? Just the same way we should find out why people become revisionist. ",t3_a5uuwt,communism

In this internationalist and communist spirit, we try to follow the developments today in countries like China, Vietnam, Cuba and other countries. ... >Of course, the USA will continue its imperialist political line, as it is the number 1 economic and military power in the world. However, they are worried about China’s elevation into the 2nd position in the international economy and of course they worry about the balance of trade that is negative for the USA and positive for China. Particularly when China is the number 1 creditor country of the USA, which owes China over 1.5 trillion dollars. So the USA sees China as its number 1 enemy today, which has good relations with Russia which is the second strongest military power in the world. >Comrades, >It is our duty as a communist movement to follow all these developments closely, to exchange views, information, to determine a joint stance and activities in relation to the entire international situation and the developments that threaten our peoples. Do you really think that's what's going on in this thread or that the KKE's internal criticism of the CCP is the same as declarations about whether China is socialist/not-socialist and whether it deserves our 'support' as random people on the internet or in tiny groups?

"Close but not quite. Socialism is an economic mode of production (economic system) where people collectively own the means of production (factories, farms, manufactures, basically anything that produces) and distribution (eg. stores) either directly, or through a state. Socialism follows the mantra 'to each according to his ability, to each according to his work'. Basically, you get what you work for. Its a meritocracy in that sense. so for example, instead of one business owner getting the profits from an industry, the business is collectively owned and run by its employees, or by a state controlled by the workers. So for example the USSR was a socialist country Communism is similar, but it is stateless, classless and moneyless, and it follows the mantra 'to each according to his ability, to each according to his need'.

"I think u/Evillati explained it best, but I would like to add a bit more. In June 1991, three months after the referendum that voted to preserve the Soviet Union, albeit a reformed one, Yeltsin was elected president of the Russian SFSR, beating Gorbachev’s preferred candidate by a wide margin. The Baltic nations, which showed the most resistance to Soviet control since it fell under its control since World War II, declared independence around the same time, with Lithuania gaining independence after Soviet troops killed Lithuanian border guards, which weakened the Soviet Union’s position domestically and internationally, and Latvians erected numerous barricades around important government buildings after the events in Lithuania. The days of August 19-21, 1991 seemed to be the climax for these events. On that 20th, the Russian SFSR was supposed to sign a treaty that would’ve made the Soviet Union a loose confederation of independent states in which the Communist Party would’ve still had some control over daily life. An increasing number of reformists within the Russian SFSR kept demanding a full market economy, even if it meant the complete dissolution of the Soviet Union. To counter this, hardliners in the Communist Party, including Gorbachev’s vice president, placed Gorbachev under house arrest while he was on vacation on the 19th, and subsequently issued an emergency decree and banned most newspapers in the country. After hearing the news, thousands gathered into the streets to protest the coup, especially in Moscow, and defended Yeltsin, who publicly denounced the coup. After three days, the coup collapsed. The following days, Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary and, as mentioned before in u/Evillati’s comment, the Party dissolved indefinitely. Within the next few months, 10 republics declared independence, mostly in fear of another coup. Around the same time, the leaders of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia met to form the Commonwealth of Independent States, which still exists today. On December 1, Ukraine voted for independence (90% voted in favor). On December 12, all members of the Council of the Soviets, the lower house of the Supreme Soviet, were recalled and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. Early Christmas morning, Gorbachev announced in a televised address that he was resigning as President of the Soviet Union. Later that night, the flag of the Soviet Union was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time and the Russian tricolour rose in its place. Then, the next day, the upper house of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Republics, voted to dissolve itself and the Soviet Union, thus ending the nation that once brought global capitalism to its knees",t3_ab5tdo,communism

">What felt like bursting out of the 19th century, the 20th century started with a bang. Eric Blair, or who later came to be known as George Orwell, was just one of the many children born in the first decade of the new century. 1903 to be exact, and in British India, to a somewhat “lower-upper middle class” family (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 136). To fully understand the kind of world Orwell was born into, one must look at the events going on around him as he grew up. The defining feature of the second decade of the 1900s that set up the world for an even greater disaster that would change the landscape for Europe, and arguably, the world forever, was the Great War or, World War One. Orwell was growing up during these times, he was merely 11 years old when it started and 15 when the war ended, he even calls himself a “snob” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 136). The sad, gut wrenching truth of the matter is that around 20 million people died and another 21 million were wounded in the span of 4 years of his life (Mougel). This would have a lasting effect on everyone, even Orwell. By the time he worked on the great two-part analysis that is The Road to Wigan Pier, and got it published it was March 8th, 1937. Nearly 20 years had passed since the Bolshevik Revolution that started the USSR, and it’s stumbling start but then rapid industrialization under Stalin’s fist (BBC, Soviet Union Timeline). It had been a little over a decade after Britain’s first and only nine day General Strike (Mitchinson). The Great Depression had hit eight years ago and was hurting working class families globally (University). Nazi Germany was a current and alive political power and Hitler had declared himself Fuhrer about two years and seven months ago (Florida). Orwell was just two months away from fighting in Revolutionary Spain. Dismissing his intent on “writing newspaper articles” to instead fight alongside his Catalonian brothers and sisters against the might and ferocity of the fascists (Orwell, Homage to Catalonia). And lastly, but very much not the least, the invasion of Poland and the start of World War 2 was about two years and six months away (Florida). This is the unimaginable world that Orwell grew up in. But these events happened, and they made the world that Orwell wrote about and lived in. The Road to Wigan Pier and his other works are so incredibly useful to learn about that world, but also the events going on around it. >Remembered by many in the West for his great works like Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty Four (1949), Orwell, contrary to popular belief, was actually very much a Socialist. Animal Farm being a story driven commentary on Stalinism and the specific Anarchist argument against Marxist-Leninist theory and practice about how to transition to a Communist society (Orwell, Catastrophic Gradualism). Obvious to anyone who’s read Animal Farm or some of his other more telling works like Catastrophic Gradualism, Orwell, like many other Socialists before and after him, was highly critical of Stalin and the USSR. In the same vein, Nineteen Eighty Four was more a commentary on the dystopian outlook he had for capitalism and the world and the future he believed the human race was heading towards. As can be seen from his letter to Noel Willmett in May of ’44, on whether totalitarianism is on the rise. While those works are wholly relevant to who Orwell was, and the world they commented one, they happened after the writing of The Road to Wigan Pier. >Orwell’s account of the material conditions the working class had to suffer in northern England is undeniably helpful to understanding this moment in time, much like how Orwell looked to other writers to get a sense of their world (Beadle 190). He wasn’t the first, nor was he the last to write about the human cost of capitalism, but he did it in a way that was simple and understandable. The second part of his work is very different than the first, so much so the first part was distributed without the second part as a propaganda piece (Davison). It contains his class analysis of the state of the working and middle classes and their class consciousness and efforts. It also contains his argument about the well-off Socialists, or better known as ‘Champagne Socialists’ and how they can lose sight of the end goal. Nonetheless, he ends the work with an adamant and somewhat hopeful view of the future. Where he sees a future where the middle and working classes come together and raging a revolution against the “plutocracy” and capitalism (231 Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier). By November ‘39. About 47,079 copies of the various editions of the work were distributed (Davison). >Before writing The Road to Wigan Pier, Orwell spent two months in Lancashire and Yorkshire living with different working class people (Davison). Unemployment had already peaked at 2.5 million people, or 25% of the work force in Britain in ‘33 (BBC). But Orwell states that “this is an enormous under-estimate” as he states it only considers the ones “drawing the dole – that is, in general, the heads of families” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 74). He even recounts a conversation with a “Labour Exchange officer” who told him to get a better estimate, “multiply the official figures by something over three” (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 74). That is to say that in ’36 Britain had an unemployment rate around 70ish% or six million people. He then addresses how the average wage is around 30 shillings a week. He proceeds to budget it out and expressed that an average family must survive on six to seven shillings a week “to be fed, clothed, warmed, and otherwise cared-for” and how “a third of the whole population” lives like this (Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier 78).

"The biggest threat from a recession is an inability to pay bills and buy what you need to live. Realize that most American spending is manufactured BS. The fastest and easiest way to reduce your living expenses is co-habitation, either with family or with friends/roommates, splitting rent and utilities. Once you get your rent down, next are various other ways to live better and more cheaply. I'm going to post some articles from an early retirement blog, you don't have to do any of the retirement stuff, it's mostly to show that eschewing a consumer-based lifestyle can reduce expenses down to a very manageable level. First is that, all debt is an emergency and must be treated as such:  The other side of things is your wages. I tell people whenever I do an interview that I think people are like sharks - you're either moving forward, or you're suffocating. What 'moving forward' means is different based on your goals, but since we spend 1/3 of our lives at the workplace, moving forward in your career is important, I think. This means constantly either developing your current skills or new skills, and not being afraid to make huge life changes to make it happen, like changing careers or moving to a new city. When you are constantly seeking to develop yourself this way it makes you a very desirable employee, which will drive up your wages in a tight labor market and maximize your opportunities when there is slack in the labor market. I can't tell you what to do because I don't know your interests and talents, but things like learning how to code using a website like Treehouse or mastering a trade are invaluable skills that will serve you better than playing Xbox every weekend. Not saying to ditch the leisure time, leisure is very important, but if you're worried about weathering a recession you may want to spend some of your free time developing your career. Basically, through a combination of always developing skills (makes your labor more desirable, so you can always sell your labor and you can sell it at higher wages. Also builds confidence, which is needed to complete interviews successfully) and driving down your living expenses you can weather any recession. ",t3_aam8zt,communism

"Not one single person but I think one big factor that kind of implanted this fear of socialism were us newspapers and journalists in the early years of the ussr. Yellow journalism ran rampant and publishers tried anything to stir up drama and increase sales, the ussr and socialism was an easy target considering their recent rise to power, increasing power of the working class and labor unions in America and the apparent threat they posed to big business. These fears were accentuated and turned into mass fear when newspapers created insane stories about the ussr and how horrid life was there and how if unions were allowed to influence the us further a revolution was imminent and life would collapse. This increased fear turned the public against unions and in turn Union members against socialists. In an attempt to avoid even further government wraith and public hatred unions purged many socialists. Through media and government scare campaigns the us was able to deal the biggest possible blow to American socialism: turning the workers against class conscious peoples and socialists, it worked so well that it continues to this day and is a huge obstacle in the way of anything pro worker here in the us.

">What was the social life of the Communists in the Soviet Union? pretty big question and is pretty hard to answer without filling up the text limit. in short it wasn't a hell hole, people were not falling over dead in the streets. the population was provided for, housing, jobs, etc. of course it varies a bit depending who was leading, but in general it wasn't awful. >Was the Soviet Union on the lifeline its who life or was it thriving? the early years were of course very hard for the USSR, a civil war and then massive reconstruction afterwards was very time consuming. some of the major economical and infrastructural gains were made in the stalin era with collectivization and the introduction of the 5 year plans. after stalin died krushchev and others began introducing liberalizing polices, policies against planned economy, and the reintroduction of the profit motive, this lead to a slow down in soviet economy. after decades these polices took a toll and were never reversed, and the soviet economy was on its knees by the late 80s. >What were some important innovations that happened in the Soviet Union?

"According to a comrade here: >Actually, the Senators of SPA are the ones who really have power, they are not elected by Party but by person, everyone older than 17 can present him/herself without much problem, and if the people vote for them, they are accepted, then the SPA votes for different charges, the only reason that Kim Jong-Un stays as Chairman of the WPK, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army is because the SPA wants so, thats only because of the respect they have to Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, its also very common to see they are a 'hereditary monarchy', while the truth is, as they have similar positions, they dont actually have inherited any charge. At this moment, the Head of State, that has more power than Kim Jong-Un, is the President of the SPA, at this moment Kim Yong-Nam (No, he is not a familiar of the Kim ''Dinasty'', he just has the same surname, normal considering Kim is the most common surname in both Koreas), the position of Kim Jong-Un is that of the already mentioned Chairman of the WPK, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, also he has the title of 'Supreme Leader', but that is mostly honorary, the real person with power in the DPRK right now is Kim Yong-Nam.

"I believe that if we look at Lenin's Imperialism the highest stage of capitalism, then we can infer that perhaps socialism could never resist revisionism/reactionary presence as long as an imperial core exists as the contradictions in its mode of production (capitalism) would be too great too ignore, and eventually will leverage as much military might on foreign nations as it can to not implode- until it does. So perhaps Marx was right. We need to wait for the strongest capitalist/imperialist core to collapse before we can make a global movement. Their failure will free oppressed global south nations which will allow workers to rise up there and beat back the fascists. Without the imperialist core's presence suppressing workers movements in these countries the world would largely be in that cold war era-esque revolutionary state. And then perhaps America (and other large imperialist countries) will begin to transition into revolutionary phases too.",t3_a5uuwt,communism

"American political discourse ignores political economy. What makes you left-wing vs right-wing depends on whether you support gay marriage, abortion, etc. These are important issues of course, but that's where the argument usually ends. The realm of economics and it's relation to sociology and politics is almost always either purposely brushed under the rug or simply looked over due to sheer ignorance. Americans aren't taught 'left-wing economics' nor do they typically even know such a thing exists. The vast majority of Americans aren't even taught about Keynesian economics much less Marxist economics. There is only one acceptable school of economic thought in this country, a far right-wing economics school of thought called orthodox liberal economics/neoliberal economics. This is all that's being taught at American universities these days. This is also called censorship but that's moving onto another issue. The Democrats are a neoliberal party just like the Republicans are. Both adhere to far-right economic policy. This used to not be the case in the interventionalist liberalism period/Keynesian period of the 50s-70s when the Dems supported center-right economic policy but that ended in the 80s. Now both adhere to the cult of free market ideology. Just because one party doesn't care as much who you fuck or what you smoke while the other one does, doesn't mean you can ignore their monetary policies. Give her this example. Raúl Castro once joked, and this is true btw, that the CPP should actually adopt the American two party system. He would lead one wing, a conservative wing, while Fidel would lead the other. They'd both be communist parties just like both parties in the US are liberal parties, but one would more more accepting of gay marriage and etc. Does this suddenly make the right-wing communist party actually right-wing? No of course not. It's still a communist party and far more left-wing than any liberal party. I think a big issue is that Americans don't know what liberalism is. Ask her why liberal parties in Europe and all over the world are all considered right wing.",t3_a5wjdn,communism

"Philosophy, science and mathematics are intertwined in dialectical materialism. Lenin: >The philosophy of Marxism is *materialism*. Throughout the modern history of Europe, and especially at the end of the eighteenth century in France, where a resolute struggle was conducted against every kind of medieval rubbish, against serfdom in institutions and ideas, **materialism has proved to be the only philosophy that is consistent, true to all the teachings of natural science** and hostile to superstition, cant and so forth. The enemies of democracy have, therefore, always exerted all their efforts to “refute”, under mine and defame materialism, and have advocated various forms of philosophical idealism, which always, in one way or another, amounts to the defence or support of religion. ... >But Marx did not stop at eighteenth-century materialism: he developed philosophy to a higher level, he enriched it with the achievements of German classical philosophy, especially of Hegel’s system, which in its turn had led to the materialism of Feuerbach. The main achievement was *dialectics*, i.e., the doctrine of development in its fullest, deepest and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of the human knowledge that provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter. **The latest discoveries of natural science—radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements—have been a remarkable confirmation of Marx’s dialectical materialism** despite the teachings of the bourgeois philosophers with their “new” reversions to old and decadent idealism. Personally I find that the contradictions of relativity and quantum physics of energy and mass, particles and waves, time and space, and so forth to be remarkable confirmations of dialectical materialism.",t3_a995ex,communism
"Yes you are right. I should have made that distinction. Exactly, there were so many purges during Stalin's time, but they could not weed out Khrushchev. It can't simply be one man. There were so many people like Khrushchev, if it was not him, someone body else would have done it. There must be an underlying generating process that makes people look at things in this way. I bet if the USSR had overtaken the US and Western Europe, there would have been no revisionism. Perhaps you are right, but Deng was no Lenin. Lenin was more honest saying we are taking a step backwards while instituting the NEP, Deng looks more opportunistic in comparison, there is no talk of a retreat or anything similar. I think those two reasons seem interesting, but there must be much more. Do you know if Khrushchev and his clique were from the country side?

"Thanks for the compliment =D I have 2 possible answers. The first is that multiple imperialisms represents a stage in capitalist development which is no longer possible. Of course in Lenin's time Britain was world hegemon but smaller imperialisms could still exist. Not only could the backwards Russian imperialism still exist in the same world as advanced monopoly capitalism, but Britain actually financed Japanese imperialism (I'm currently reading a book called *Lever of Empire* on this if you're interested in Japan and the way the gold standard functioned to support the British imperialist world order). Japan could compete with monopoly capitalist imperialism by parasitically attacing itself to Britain, something one cannot imagine today (not only was South Korea's development fundamentally different than Japan's for this reason - new members of the imperialist club are no longer possible - but South Korea's development is not possible as the first world begins to close its markets as the twilight of American imperialist hegemony begins). Of course one shouldn't confuse appearance for essence, the Russo-Japanese war and then Asia-Pacific war showed which type of imperialism was dying and which was growing and the essential correctness of Lenin's thesis which was still coming into being in his lifetime. Germany was unfortunate enough to be too powerful to subordinate itself to Britain but too weak to compete with America, and its attempt to replicate the founding of America through continent wide genocide was too late in history. Regardless, the tendency is towards a singular imperialism not bound to any nation state, the final stage before world socialism in my opinion. The second answer is that competing imperialisms can coexist in moments of transfer from one structure of imperialism to the other. But they must exist in constant warfare until a final war determines the leader of world capitalism. And the first principle is still true, the world will never again have competing imperialisms as it did in the scramble for africa or carving up of China and each conflict will have its own shape (and misunderstanding this is reactionary as can be seen by trying to use the backwards imperialisms of Lenin's day to categorize Russia and China today as imperialist). e: This is from the perspective of capital, from the perspective of labor it is very different. The whole history of communism is the history of forcing capitalism to adapt, and the history of imperialism is as much about the forces of production outgrowing the relations of production geographically as capital having to change its geography to cope with an increasingly global proletarian movement.

"Don't worry, most people feel the same way, it takes courage to acknowledge it rather than flee into the comfort of liberal ideology. The most important thing once you realize that everything you've been taught is a lie is to relearn the structure of history rather than merely different facts (which are necessary but not sufficient). For example, looking to communism as the 'good history' which has been denied to you by the reality of capitalist crimes. Communism is just of course but reality is complicated and will never live up to the fantasy of what was supposed to happen in a perfectly just world. No matter how passionate, you'll burn out and communism will become 'the God that failed' as it did for many petty-bourgeois fellow travelers once they realized third world liberation wasn't for them. The world as it exists was made by immense violence and sustained by it and any attempt to break that world order is both inherently just and inevitably pragmatic. The Cuban communist party made decisions in hindsight that were mistaken (though it's not easy to determine such a thing, decisions can be right in 1940 and wrong in 1941), but this does not mean they were hopelessly revisionist or useless. Instead, learn what they believed the primary contradiction to be, why they believed that, how it guided their actions, and how it could have been interpreted differently (both the guerillas and communist party saw imperialism as the primary contradiction but came to opposite conclusions. Why?) Comintern aligned parties saw defense of the USSR as the primary task during and immediately after the war. Obviously this had an impact on Cuba, but how did this theory develop into eurocommunism in the first world and national liberation in the third?

They are almost an exclusively Brahmin led party (which is shocking since Brahmins make up only three percent of the population) and they enjoy almost no support from the Dalit or Aadivasi communities, just like all other traditional socialist/communist parties. And for good reason too - communist parties in the past have been extremely casteist and have vehemently tried to derail the lower caste movement, the CPI(M) and its predecessors included. And today there are so many indicators to show that the CPI(M) is still very casteist in its approach and operation, albeit not as openly as in the past.

"Bookchin didn't want to get rid of power in the last analysis though. This view was a part of his earlier anarchist period of ideas. Rather Communalism seeks the growth of a dual-power in the political realm (conceived of in an Arendtian sense), rather than a Leninist sort of seizure of power. To quote Urbanization: >A libertarian or confederal municipalist politics advances the best approach against 'seizures' of state power and its retention by an elite, by slowly trying to accrete power for municipalities-initially, by acquiring moral power for municipal assemblies, as I have indicated in the closing chap- ter of this book. Libertarian or confederal municipalism seeks to expand the democratic institutions that still linger on in any modern republican system by opening them to the widest public participation possible at any given time. Hence the slogan that I have advanced: 'Democratize the Republic! Radicalize the Democracy!' It is not that state power is to be 'seized' -and then never relinquished-but that popular power is to be expanded until all power belongs to the institu- tions of a participatory democracy. Bookchin did by and large adopt much of Lenin's views with regards to the dual power however, particularly in as much as Lenin talks about the dual power as 'the same type as the Paris Commune of 1871.'",t3_aa15bn,communism

"Your point about the cadre structure makes sense and actually contextualizes where broader potential differences could have developed between them. My only question is whether or not that was in the Stalin or post-Stalin period because I think it's likely that similar policies existed during the time the 25 was being sent to reorganize collective farming. That's a good question, and I don't have the answer for you. When I had read the book, it seemed to suggest it was in the Stalin era, but perhaps I was reading into it what wasn't actually there. Perhaps the institutional differences between the Stalin and Mao eras in that regard are less different than I made them out to be. Requires more rigorous research, but I only have time for so many books! 'It's not about letting the masses make the decisions. It's about incorporating the masses into the project so that they can make their own decisions.' 'It's about a dialogue between the masses and the Party, not one dominating the other.' Those are the kind of subtle distinctions that clears it up for me. You mean it's the social spirit of involvement in democratic institutions as opposed to a more functional involvement. I don't disagree that China has more of that than the Soviet Union did (at least after its prime). All I would say is not to draw hard conclusions for either country on that sense because we can't quantify that dialogue between the state and the masses. Pierre F. Landry cited the quantified direct local participation of China (relative to other countries) and it is among the highest in the world. It is actually higher than many of the cited Western 'democracies.' Finding more about that could give us a deeper sense of that spirit of involvement and dialogue, but I would stay cautious (as the Xi leadership is). The class struggle in China is aggressive and there are more than a few people in varying positions of power that would destroy it with neoliberalism if they ever gained the leverage (military leverage especially). You're exactly right. It can't really be quantified, yet paradoxically it can be compared. And it is difficult to draw hard conclusions from it, something I'm trying not to do, but to look at in its entirety. Of course, if there was just 'less' 'spirit of involvement' in the Soviet Union, it's a rather weak material basis for degeneration into revisionism. Plus it sounds Trotskyist or ultra. The point I've hoped to make is not that having 'less' 'spirit of involvement' made the USSR fail, but that it was not a priority for the leadership, due in part to the limitations of their theory, being the first successful socialist revolution. You learn a lot in a hundred years, and that this not being a priority contributed to the rise of revisionism. At the same time, though, you have Lenin basically admitting before he died that they didn't really know what they were doing, not having anyone else to learn from. I can only imagine the thoughts going through their heads! I do agree that Stalin's foreign policy was traditional, as in it was not exactly based in class politics, but in basic self-preservation. I just don't judge the Soviet leadership on that question. I don't either. I don't judge them positively or negatively. It's just a fact of life. Foreign policy is not a dinner party. Deng was right when he proposed every nation needs to work on its own development. You can't just export revolution all the time. There are limitations. The Bolsheviks were responsible first and foremost to the Soviet people. And I genuinely recommend the book I mentioned by Marshall T. Poe. It's incredible how Russia has been under threat for literally centuries and basically forged its own political identity through that distinct need of self-defense. I'll check it out. And it's not just Russia, that's any country subject to imperialism. I've seen a good amount of these hyper-equalitarian criticisms before, and I guess I was presupposing your position. I just can't understand Trotskyists or Maoists who bring it up as the main issue. I must have misunderstood your point, but I was just saying greater formal equality or even (urban and rural) development would not have strengthened or preserved either the Soviet Union or People's Republic as state experiments. Contemporary China has disparities between city and town (I don't exactly know how the Chinese leadership is fixing that problem, but they have my general trust), but it's broader successes (including closing the wealth gap with the West) are more important, and there are more than a few comrades who argue that a lack of formal equality is the real problem underlying many socialist states and their 'failures.' I see no reason to believe that. The vague appeal to equality is certainly unscientific. The specific criticism of the town vs country divide is important though, not just because of a vague appeal to equality, as it does not exist in isolation, but describes the veritable alliance (or disunity) between the proletariat and the peasantry. For a socialist state to focus on the development of the proletariat, and see the development of agriculture only as a means to develop the proletariat, this is not unity, this is the proletariat as a/the dominant class and the peasantry as a/the dominated class. This is not the road to a classless society. Beyond that, though, Samir Amin (again, I know, I need to read more authors lmao) makes the observation in his book *L'avenir du maoïsme* (1981) '*The Future of Maoism*' that prioritizing urban development in its own right is indicative of national bourgeois economic development in the peripheries. Following these bourgeois economic models, he argues, is the primary source of revisionism in the USSR. (Plus the Khrushchevite coup was so easy because of limited mass involvement, as discussed.) It's certainly an interesting argument, even if imperfect.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"I think it is likely that there were differences between the Stalin and Mao eras, but they were subtle, not these fundamental divergences. Institutions may have just been not fully balanced from either end of the 'central-decentral poles' of learning, teaching, organizing, and implementing policy. One was 'too central' and the other 'not central enough,' and they struggled for balance in their particular histories. And basically, nothing is revealed by reducing everything to 'Stalin was a bureaucrat' or 'Mao was an ultra.' '...but that it was not a priority for the leadership, due in part to the limitations of their theory, being the first successful socialist revolution. You learn a lot in a hundred years, and that this not being a priority contributed to the rise of revisionism.' Fair enough, but I would just add historical contingency could have changed that. If half of the Central Committee was full of young and new Stalinists, it could have at least kept the ideological conversation going (especially if a healthy Sino-Soviet relationship was sustained, as both could have compared themselves, mutually taught each other, and reformed their particular problems accordingly), but the ideological leadership (and any vision with it) did effectively die with Stalin and Molotov. Did Stalin even attempt to teach a few proteges who could have replaced him? Does it make me sound like an aristocrat for preferring that type of General-Secretary succession of power? 'And it's not just Russia, that's any country subject to imperialism.' I meant in the context of Europe. The three other major empires of Europe don't have their history almost exclusively on their immediate border, perpetually threatened and attacked by the rest of Europe. They became global empires that based themselves and their 'success' in the majority of their foreign colonies. Russia was far more limited in its successes and ambitions, always poor but aggressively self-sufficient, and ambiguous about modernity and its connections and similarities to Asia. Russia became its own distinct social-political-economic force in Europe by not becoming European or Asian, and as modern news tells us, they'll never become European (too much totalitarian blood in these Slavic veins of ours), and they're 'pivoting' now to Asia. That's a great point about checking the signs of proletariat-peasant unity (or lack of) through prioritized development. I would just say not to sell the Lenin and Stalin leaderships short. They, the party, and the state appealed to, accepted in, educated, and organized millions of rural comrades who made their plans of nationalization and collectivization at all possible (Lynne Viola's book is considered definitive, as far as I know). And I would add that Amin and his school need to not underplay how fundamentally industrialization was perceived by the early Soviets as their competitive advantage and key to 'catch up' with the West (remember, Deng was clear about China having to catch up with the West before they can achieve true equity in China itself) and especially the distinct role of violence in Russian (and I am not sure about non-Russian Soviet) clan and class society and how that may have caused the basic satisfaction they had with rural policy (which itself somehow resulted in a generic and apolitical policy of wage equalization and other equalizations of public access to goods and service). Amin's note is a fair point, but it roots itself too much in the 'poverty of theory' and 'revisionist betrayals' and not the urgent material realities that often lead to that poverty of thinking or a lack of political creativity and vision. We have to balance theory with information and pragmatism and avoid quasi-moralism that masks as class politics.

And in the past decade we've seen a global resurgence of left politics, even some attempted revolutions. Now, I don't believe that capitalism will automatically end in communism—it might, but it also might end in some unimaginable kind of eco-fascism, with militarized states responding to climate disaster by controlling scarce natural resources and repressing migrations, or simply general civilizational collapse and new forms of reactionary tribalism. But it *will* end, one way or another. New political opportunities and ruptures are opening every day.

"I am a worker. It is in my economic self-interest to expand my own economic power as much as possible. Therefore industrial democracy is more in line with my economic self interest than the industrial autocracy we find in capitalism. This goes for profit and rent as well. Both are merely different forms of extracting the surplus value from my labour. This means that abolishing this systematic theft of the value I produce is more in line with my economic self-interest than enduring it. You're right about force and authority being something we all need to be sceptical of. But you are just plain wrong when you seem to imply that unregulated capitalism somehow requires less authority. The guilded age of a American capitalism is a prime example. It was extremely unregulated, but also massively violent when it came to things like union busting and cracking down on political dissent. Another example is Leopold's Congo; no government oversight at all. Just a guy murdering and enslaving millions on his private property.

Cuz I'm definitely still in the 'Mao and Stalin committed genocide and we should separate the left from them' mindset You're looking only for the results, not the historic process that constructed their actions. Both Mao and Stalin rose to power amidst VERY complicated times. For Stalin, the russian revolution was over, but the power struggle inside the USSR and, more important, the foreign powers that were decided to end the people's government were presente. The Purges were, **in theory**, what the western media was reporting: imprisonment and execution of the Party and government officials, repression of wealthy landlords and the Red Army leadership. But, more than this, they were the only way to Stalin to concretize his power and secure the future of the revolution. You cannot forget that both internal and external powers fought inside Russia during the revolutions, trying to topple the soviets and reinstate the Romanovs to power. Have these parties felt that dissent was present, Stalin would have faced another civil war. For Mao, the process was similar. Post-revolution China was a mess, half a billion people we're living in a Middle Age country that needed URGENT industrialization. The Great Leap Forward was necessary for the survival of the country itself. The famine that ensued (worsened by droughts) was the last in China history. Any human being would prefer a 'clean' revolution, without fights or deahts. But that's not possible today, and was even worse back in that days.

"I'm awful at the natural sciences, so bear with me. But I see them as entirely compatible. We know that Einstein's theory says that things like time are relative to positioning in the universe. The theory of relativity doesn't discount the notion of objective reality, only adds some nuance to it. The opposite, subjective reality, doesn't just say that things are relative, but that things are relative from individual to individual, even though most of us experience pretty much the same reality. There's no conflict. On top of that, dialectical materialism is most useful in analyzing social conditions, which, all existing on Earth, are essentially operating from the same position of relativity. Furthermore, the notion of relatively isn't entirely useless to Marxists. The proletariat experiences a different reality than the bourgeoisie. Marxists are not utopians or liberals. We do not bemoan the bourgeoisie being stupid. We demand revolution precisely because they are not stupid, because they act rationally in their own self-interest. It's about conflicting interests, even conflicting realities, if you prefer. This is not to say that one 'reality' is not more correct than the other one. The Marxist and proletarian analysis of capitalism is much more scientific than bourgeois analysis, lending credence to the Marxist analysis. This is science. ",t3_a995ex,communism

Let's assume 1 hour for both. Now if I take out the wine after 1 year from Vat 1 and after 2 years from Vat 2, the wine from Vat 2 will sell for a higher price. Clearly it took the same amount of labour time to pour and prepare the wine from both vats. Let's say 1 hour each. Then both wines took the same amount of labour time to make ie 2 hours. The mere act of waiting for the second wine, cannot be counted towards the amount of labour time it took to make it.

"Yes it is possible, but I think it's often very difficult to do because of a fundamental difference in framing. I personally used to be a capitalist and fairly liberal, not by any real conscious choice but mostly as a result of being born in America with a right wing family and basically coming out of the womb bathing in pro-capitalist, pro-liberal, anti-communist propaganda. It's been a long and arduous journey to get to this point and shed off a lot of really stupid opinions. I have had a friend for the past 5-6 years who is a politically active Latin American communist, who I met online. I talked to this guy a lot and I used to argue and debate with him vehemently about all sorts of issues relating to communism, like multi hour long debates where I would get incredibly exasperated with what seemed to be completely absurd views and how nothing I said would get through to him. I am now able to admit that I was wrong on every single one of those arguments, but it's been very hard to get to that point and ultimately what convinced me was not any of his arguments themselves but my own observations of the deficiencies of capitalism. The main problem as I see it is the fact that Marxist arguments seem incredibly logical but *only within a Marxist framework*. That's where the fundamental issue lies: if you are coming at the debate from a liberal frame of reference, Marxist arguments sound absurd and seem to completely lack any logical connection to reality (and if you are born in the west and especially in America, it's extremely likely that not only you are but that you don't even recognize it as a liberal framing or that there can even be an alternative because it feels like common sense). The basic assumptions made are so different that even if you both feel like you're talking about the same thing, you're almost certainly talking past each other because your arguments will be received and analyzed through a completely different lens. If you're talking to a liberal (especially a layman who is only liberal by circumstance of birthplace), you have to understand that 1) they have no conception of the labor theory of value, so any arguments of political economy will ultimately fall flat. Value is the price at market, anything else is irrelevant. 2) they analyze society based on the unit of the *individual* first and foremost, while a Marxist primarily cares about *class*. Therefore you get lots of takes like 'But people are just greedy/lazy/selfish' and 'that isn't a problem with the system, it's because people are apathetic. If they cared enough/voted/stopped buying from Amazon it would change.' When you are talking about a class on the whole, they are mentally deconstructing that class into its component individuals acting ostensibly freely rather than part of a greater whole which is largely at the mercy of systemic forces. 3) they have no conception of the distinction between private and personal property, so when you say you want to abolish private property, they think you want to take away their iphones and nice clothes. And 4) they probably have no actual idea what communism or Marxism even entails. The probably have no idea what capitalism entails from an academic standpoint. When they hear communism, they think Stalin's USSR, China, North Korea. They know nothing about what communism looks like beyond the erroneous assertion of 'commies want everyone to be the same. Everyone is not the same, therefore communism is stupid.' To have a productive discussion with a liberal, you really usually have to bring the debate down to the very fundamentals and construct a new frame for them from the ground up, which can only happen in a very particular debate format. In a casual debate without formal rules, they'll usually bring out a ton of higher level claims and expect a response, and then the response will be unsatisfying because it's received without the proper scaffolding to put it into the necessary context. But trying to drill down into the ground level frame gets very abstract and they won't be receptive to it because the higher level issues that seem to them morally egregious or unjustifiable haven't been addressed adequately in their mind. We are operating on a liberal playing field with these debates and as such we are placed in a losing position from the start. What I think might be a productive way to radicalize a liberal is to start not with communism or Marxism, but begin with convincing them of some of the big problems with capitalism, and then just letting it sit for a while. If you can convince them that capitalism is unsustainable, gravity alone will carry them toward Marxism over time, and in the process they'll eventually realize that liberalism itself is problematic even if it's uncomfortable to acknowledge that the values you've been taught your whole life aren't necessarily objectively correct. You illuminate the problem first, then offer a solution. For me, like I said, I debated against communism for years and often, but what ultimately was the turning point for me was in a college economics course by a very neolib professor actually. We were studying about the Japanese economy and the population decline and when I was researching it and found out that global population will likely level off and begin to decline within my life time I started to kind of realize that wow, this seems like it's going to be really bad for capitalism, because if there isn't growth anywhere of new markets and new laborers, there's gonna be a collapse at some point in the not distant future. I came to the realization on my own that capitalism is predicated on an assumption of constant growth that can't continue forever, and that was the thread that started to unravel all of it. And even then it took about 3 more years to finally get to where I am now. It was a slow progression from questioning capitalism to being certain that capitalism was unsustainable but not knowing the alternative (I am still a liberal at that point so Marxism still sounds dumb), and that was helped along a lot by taking a great philosophy course in my last year of uni and learning to think about and evaluate philosophical ideas, and coming out as trans, gaining more personal perspective on what things are like for the less privileged. After reaching that point though, the radicalization from there to shedding most of my remaining liberalism and becoming a full on communist was very very fast, within a year. The hardest step is the first one. TL;DR - the framing is the issue, and that makes arguments very unproductive. First start by convincing them capitalism is unsustainable, then they will naturally be receptive to the solution",t3_a3wp6f,communism

"To make it more explicit Let’s say that each vat is a wooden barrel and costs 2$ and the ingredients cost 1$, and labour cost is $1 for 1 hour, the cheap wine sells for $4 and the expensive one for $8. Lets’s also assume that we sell the barrel along with the wine. Let’s say it takes 1 hour of labour time to produce both types of wines. Now if it takes 1 year to make the cheap wine the cost of production would be: 2+1+1=$4 In the case of the fine wine it would be the same as well 2+1+1=$4 But the market price is $8 for the fine wine! Perhaps if I wait 3 years I can even sell it for $12! So where did the “extra” $4 come from? You are correct it saying that you can make twice the amount of cheap wine in the same amount of time as you would spend making the fine wine.

And regarding a culture-specific democratic centralism that acknowledges 'social diversity' or 'diversity of identity' as a necessary part in debating and discussing ideology, I do think that it is possible and also necessary if it's trying to work in contemporary society, but even if it isn't and I'm wrong, I'm not going to fight Bolivian or Indian revolutionaries over it. If the society in question can avoid non-competitive politics as a result of its cultural norms, then it can rework 'unity' in the way you're looking for. And I am not against that, just like I am not against social sensitivity. But in the United States, competition in everything is the norm. Any radical left, trying to convince left-centric workers about 'anti-imperialism' as having to be the basis of American progressive politics, is going to have to compete with others to prove that and win over large amounts of people. Especially when we think about how unconscious and reflexive that imperialism ('Exceptionalism') is in the hearts and minds of the American majority, across all demographics. 'to only engage in the battle of ideas.' I am in complete agreement. There are social relations outside of ideas. 'as they often have for the sake of unity' This is a great example that better contextualizes what you initially meant. 'perhaps some measures could have been taken' Whether it was possible or not, I would say that there was not enough time. That's what my initial comment was about. 'where everything is a lose-lose.'

"Eh. I don’t spit propaganda. I critically think about the issues. I’m just an independent really. I appreciate the recommendation. I’ll take a look at it. I don’t come here thinking that communism is impossible to pull off. Or that there isn’t a better way than the markets. Without a doubt, what people refer to as “communist”regimes over the course of history were done poorly. As a person with a bachelors in economics I learned a few things during my studies: 1. Free markets can do some seemingly bad things 2. Free markets can do some seemingly good things 3. We can definitely produce a more socially optimal outcome than an unregulated free market 4. But people are such self interested creatures, can we really expect them to contribute to society if they can’t reap enough of their own benefits directly? That is, can we just completely abolish markets and expect things to be okay? I’m skeptical here, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t possible. I guess where I argue from is that the free market is the foundation we should start from. If that foundation is too broken to build anything off of like public goods, then yes the market totally fails and we can do better. If the market has externalities, then we should manipulate the market. But if the market does not have any externalities...we redistribute wealth after the market has reached its initial allocation (the extent of that redistribution is debatable). TL;DR: Markets = kinda good, kinda bad...how good or bad depends on the particular market...but we are never going to optimize social utility by only relying on the market...if people were benevolent enough, we could probably do without them entirely, but I think we are inherently too selfish to pull it off.",t3_a3rhdy,communism

"This is a hard question. I would not be surprised to see the FI playing a role in this. My analysis may not be too deep, but it seems that the FI has a lot of fascistic tendencies. Mélenchon is a demagogue. I heard reports during the election that he stopped talking about immigration in order to attract far-right voters. It's also in the name, la France insoumise. It's rather chauvinistic. As Marxists, we understand that imperialism is part of capitalism, and to defend the status of your imperialist nation-state is very opportunistic, if not fascist. En bref je dis juste que la présence de la FI ne veut pas forcément dire que le mouvement est révolutionnaire ou même gauchiste. En fait, sa présence m'indiquerait la nature chauvine de la chose. Pourtant, je peux pas nier que Mélenchon serait quand même mieux que Macron bon dieu Cela commence à répondre à ta question.

"great comment. I am not Chinese nor do i live there but i follow developments in technological influence and control quite closely, so i would politely add to this, despite the west attacking china for 'dystopian' technology enabled control (usually misrepresented ie the social credit thing was proved to be a total distortion), what we have PROOF of is the five eyes governments - the USA UK Canada Australia New Zealand - conducting mass wire taps on the entire world for reasons of surveillance and control. American companies are automatically susceptible to this and hand over data all the time. We have evidence of the British and American governments secretly using exploits in Cisco infrastructure to spy, that's just one of many examples and from the early 2010s so we can assume their capabilities are more advanced now. the internet itself was spearheaded by a division of the American military and recently it emerged that the intelligence apparatus attempted to introduce twitter like social media to Cuba with the aim of destabilisation. and of course the parent company of cambridge analytica boasted that their techniques could topple governments Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said iirc (im paraphrasing) a country without its own networks is vulnerable. an ideal world would be free from censorship except for the most shameful things but that is not the reality we are living in so I understand why china does this. additionally, the Chinese model has the potential to be exported to other countries that want to limit the amount of NATO influence it is hard not to feel that the scare mongering in the western media about china is projection to a degree",t3_a8y6lc,communism

"... how can you be constructive if you're not contributing to what you're trying to help construct? Just doesn't make sense to me. What you're constructing is a milieu that does something else somewhere else -- what should that milieu be doing, knowing its limitations? What I personally think is most useful in the Western context, by far, is to focus on anti-imperialism. I think that's the only responsible option really, which means that when you engage in a critical mode when discussing China, you can do damage by making it harder to defend the country. Right now is an especially bad time for this imo because the US is ramping up anti-China sentiment to what will likely be terrifying levels, and it's already pretty bad. Most of the Western Marxist milieu is anti-China, except in some ML circles, which is why I think those MLs sometimes take a hard stance on the matter. As for Marxist theory from China, the height of their thought is imo generally far more mature than the West's, who seem like jokes in comparison much of the time. China does have graduate programs in Marxism and whatnot and they have real problems they have real effects on, so that really shouldn't be surprising. One of my favorite journals is called International Critical Thought, which is funded by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and you can see a clear difference between what's considered serious Marxism in China and serious Marxism in the West -- serious Marxism in the West typically talks about the same things over and over without making real progress (eg, endless discussions of Gramsci/Lucaks/Althusser that repeat the same tired points, discussions on 'humanism' that never got past the level of the 1930s USSR, the relationship of Marx to Hegel taking one of the same, like, three standard stances), and has frankly never gotten a solid handle on honest dialectical materialism. The Chinese contributions to the journal basically feel like adults stepping into the room, even though I'd say the Western contributions to the journal are on the same level as something like Science Society. One big eye-opening book on China for me was China's Socialist Economy: An Outline History, which was fantastic. There's a small publishing house called Canut that puts out (bad, admittedly) translations of Chinese theory that's kind of a hidden gem. Science Society and Monthly Review also sometimes put out really good Chinese work. With regard to the DPRK, we only have limited access unfortunately, but works by Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il are easy to find and have great contributions on a wealth of topics. Even stuff like film directing in the case of Kim Jong-Il, strangely enough. As far as educated Marxists already having the proper context -- I really don't see this very often. Most people that comment on China are obviously not aware of what the state of Marxist theory in China is or what its historical conditions are. For instance, the Sino-Soviet split and its effects are not properly understood, Western Maoist-influenced ideas about the cultural revolution have little basis in Chinese experience or contemporary reflections on the period, the nature of the economy and the movement in economic theory that led to it are not really studied honestly, and people have a tendency to start moralizing without taking into account a realistic view on the historical constraints (eg, China's historical extreme poverty).",t3_a6ma8p,communism

"A person in my class complained that 'my main problem with socialists is that they argue primarily from a moral perspective.' He calls it a moral perspective, as though communism and capitalism were two competing religions. But let's be scientific about this. What actually happens? How do countries and economies actually evolve? Capitalism concentrates wealth and power at the top. [The best capitalist economists acknowledge this.](  ) Capitalism bills itself as being about competition. In the early days it was. Even now it is when a new market opens up, like during the dotcom boom in Silicon Valley 20 years ago. But competitions are won. Winning is the whole point. Somebody wins by being more productive, and the prize of victory is greater market share, taken by buying competitors or putting them out of business. So competition gives way to monopoly, and local/regional monopolies to national monopolies. (Cartels, or collusive oligopolies that join together in the same lobbying groups or conspire to keep salaries low, such as the modern tech giants, pretty much act as monopolies.) What happens once a company has monopolized its national market? Well, the monopolies of the most powerful nations spill over into their countries' client states and monopolize their markets too. This creates a major economic incentive to capture more client states and to control them more thoroughly. This is capitalist imperialism. [Lenin identified escalating imperialism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the cause of WWI,](  ) and after his death, we had a second capitalist imperialist war. Now the US is the dominant capitalist empire. But that's it, there is no more Earth to conquer. Capitalism will keep trying to concentrate wealth, but it can only do so by squeezing the rest of us harder. Maybe one empire will decline and others will rise to take its place, but the basic dynamic of wealth concentration will remain. Technology will keep improving. The productive capacity of humanity will keep growing, creating a greater and greater gap between the haves and have-nots. The means of communication will keep improving, allowing more of us to exchange information faster than before. So, the most important question is, is this capitalism stable? If every decade there are more victims of capitalism, who are further behind the rich, and are better-able to communicate with each other about that, is capitalism stable? I don't think it is. This is a factual question, not a matter of preference like a choice of beer or religion. I think capitalism will produce its own gravediggers.",t3_a3wp6f,communism

I don't see the yellow vests as being all that different from being a less overtly pro-capitalist version of the American Tea Party movement over here, tbh - involving a lot of nominally 'working class' people, but overwhelmingly dictacted by the politically backwards and relatively privileged sectors of the white/European strata of workers who aren't making any demands that challenge the capitalist system, but rather are complaining about taxes going to social services and 'illegals' (echoed in the yellow vest movement by their complaints about migrants getting too much social services), complaining about the 'leftist mainstream media and universities' and who generally just simply desire a bigger share of the spoils of imperialism. To support a movement just because there are a lot of people who work for a wage participating in it, regardless of the explicit political content being put forth by the movement, is a dogmatic and metaphysical application of Marxist analysis. We're not dealing with 19th century industrial capitalism anymore; intra-class stratification and contradictions have become sharper and sharper and we can't just consider merely anyone who works for a wage as automatically being an organic and genuine revolutionary subject.",t3_a5aj9v,communism

"'Whoever expects a “pure” social revolution will never live to see it. Such a person pays lip-service to revolution without understanding what revolution is. ... The socialist revolution in Europe cannot be anything other than an outburst of mass struggle on the part of all and sundry oppressed and discontented elements. Inevitably, sections of the petty bourgeoisie and of the backward workers will participate in it—without such participation, mass struggle is impossible, without it no revolution is possible—and just as inevitably will they bring into the movement their prejudices, their reactionary fantasies, their weaknesses and errors. But objectively they will attack capital, and the class-conscious vanguard of the revolution, the advanced proletariat, expressing this objective truth of a variegated and discordant, motley and outwardly fragmented mass struggle will be able to unite and direct it, capture power, seize the banks, expropriate the trusts which all hate (though for different reasons!), and introduce other dictatorial measures which in their totality will amount to the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the victory of socialism.” - Lenin Their demands will inevitably bring the protesters into conflict with capital and the bourgeois state, as it has already started to. The 'leftists' who are crying about some reactionary demands raised by the movement don't understand revolution. If the left decides not to support the protests, the far-right will, as they have been, and they will be able to imprint their demands on the movement. The advanced layers of the workers must join, with our own banners and slogans, and help to direct the mass anger towards capitalism, the state, etc.",t3_a2hru0,communism

"Yuan Yang in Beijing November 27, 2018 Noam Chomsky has joined more than 30 scholars from around the world calling for a boycott of Marxism conferences in China as part of the international backlash against Beijing’s crackdown on students organising pro-workers groups. The academics are mostly from leading US and UK universities and apart from Prof Chomsky, a linguistics scholar at the University of Arizona, include John Roemer, professor of political science and economics at Yale University. In a statement seen by the Financial Times, Prof Chomsky wrote: “To continue to participate in . . . officially sponsored Marxism-related events means we would stay complicit in the Chinese government’s game. Leftist scholars around the world should join the boycott of such conferences and events.” The academics were responding to the detention of students from China’s top universities over the past four months. The students had been supporting workers trying to unionise in a Jasic Technology factory in Shenzhen, the southern manufacturing hub. About 20 students and recent graduates are still in detention, the Jasic Workers’ Solidarity Group said, as well as five factory workers and other supporters. “The fact that the Chinese government is suppressing such students — even kidnapping them — exposes the political leadership as sham Marxists,” wrote Prof Roemer. Recommended Chinese society China students challenge curbs on trade unionists China’s government has grown increasingly intolerant of all forms of grassroots organising under President Xi Jinping’s rule. Although Communist in name, the party is particularly nervous about a nationwide collective of students finding solidarity with workers, an alliance at the root of its own origins as a revolutionary party. Last month, Cornell University suspended two student exchanges with China’s Renmin University. The Ivy League institution was concerned that Renmin was punishing students for supporting workers, which Cornell described as a “a violation of academic freedom”. Renmin denied the accusation. Two weeks ago another wave of students was arrested or kidnapped, including Zhang Shengye. The recent Peking University graduate was bundled into a car on campus by “men in black clothing”, according to student witnesses. Other students have been followed by police and closely watched by teachers. “Based on information we have gathered, more students are still at risk,” wrote a group of academics including Elaine Hui, an assistant professor at Penn State University, who made the initial call to boycott China’s World Congress on Marxism and “similar conferences”. Last month the government announced that Qiu Shuiping, a former state security official, had been appointed party secretary of Peking University. The appointment was interpreted by some as the start of a more authoritarian environment at the university. Peking University’s Communist party unit is also setting up two offices to perform internal “disciplinary inspections” and “control and management”, according to a leaked directive. Peking University did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Leslie Sklair, professor emeritus of sociology at the London School of Economics, wrote that he would urge his colleagues “to scrutinise ties between their universities and leading Chinese universities complicit in this repression”.

"These are answers from my point of view. Others will say other things. >What does it mean to be a communist in 2018? I think the movement is only starting to grow again significantly since the Cold War, so we're in a stage of organizing and educating. A lot of us are young and just coming into our own, so we should read and join organizations mostly. Be prepared for any demonstrations that might pop up near us. What do you believe in? That human society depends on the economic relations of the current society, and by this mechanism, capitalism developed over history. However, capitalism has many contradictions which lead it into crisis and possible collapse. A collapse would mean that economic relations would veer away from capitalistic relations, which might mean a bottom-up, direct democratic, and classless society where the means of production are common property, managed by the community for production for use, rather than exchange. Which opinions matter to you the most? I think the fundamental thing Communists should have is a deep understanding and critique of capitalism, actually. Dreaming about a possible future will get us nowhere if we don't understand the past and present. Specifically, we need to look where the possible collapse might start. >What are your values? That the proletariat must engage in revolution as a class. This means that revolution only occurs when a large portion of the working class decides to start revolution by themselves, and that they manage their revolution by bottom-up, direct democratic means. No designing utopias or power-fantasies for me. How do you establish a communist state with real communism? How do you create economic growth in a communist state? I believe the revolution will likely have to be a global one, so the entire world must witness the collapse of global capitalism. Economic growth wouldn't be measured in the same way as we do now, because the economic mode will be changed. Metrics we should use should be based on building infrastructures and systems, fulfilling societal needs completely first. Which documentaries do you recommend about Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Lenin, the Russian Revolution, Stalin, Trotsky, Castro, Che Guevara and communism in general? I don't watch too many because they're often a little biased against Communism. I saw Geniuses of the Modern World's episode on Marx; it was decent. I heard that the recent biopic *The Young Karl Marx* was decent too, but it's in German I believe?

"The fact is, most criticisms of China and North Korea from the West don't even have a basic understanding of how those countries function and what socialism actually is there. They don't understand the constraints or history, so their criticisms are mostly worthless and ignorant. You need to spend the time to actually study their theoretical base with an honest and open mind. You're also not being a constructive critic... because pretty much no one in China or the DPRK will listen or care about what you have to say. It's really arrogant to think you can have a positive influence in eg China by making a critique of it on Western social media. From an anti-imperialist standpoint, nothing is really gained by generating theory about these countries in a critical mode. You can promote understanding about these countries by mentioning uncomfortable aspects of how they function, but that has to not be from a critical mode but one of open-minded, nonjudgmental education. There is a lot to learn from both of these countries in terms of Marxist theory -- the vast majority of Marxists in the West have absolutely no recognition of that.

DPRK is a state which exists under a constant threat of annihilation, and has managed to achieve self reliance in the face of imperialist adversity. While people will debate back and forth about how socialist it is, everyone agrees they are fighting the good fight against imperialism. Plus they still produce good propaganda and it's just good fun. 2. USSR wasn't the only state in the 20th century to apply communism or even Marxist thought. The Soviet Union was (more or less depending on the time period) a Marxist-Leninist state. Not all communists are MLs and many people look to other ML states like Cuba or Burkina Faso (under Sankara) for inspiration. Most communists agree that the Russian revolution cannot be replicated the form of communism that will emerge will reflect the material conditions under which it merges.

Would you provide a quote by Lenin or Stalin where they say that? Your ideas scream for freedom for the proletatiat, yet you don't see that the way it was implemented in the USSR stepped on the freedoms of many others. You can’t grant someone freedom without restricting it for others. The question is, who do you grant the freedoms to and who do you restrict? Fascism bases the restrictions on race, sex, sexual attraction and other things people can’t change. Liberalism bases the restriction on the wealth of the individual. Socialism bases restrictions on whether or not you own the means of exploitation. So in its essence, socialism steps on the freedom of the bourgeoisie just as capitalism steps on the freedom of the proletariat. The first difference is, the former is a minority while the latter is a majority. The second difference is, you can easily become a member of the proletariat by giving away your means of exploitation and joining a common cause, while it’s incredibly hard to become a member of the bourgeoisie if you’re a member if the proletariat.",t3_a79yve,communism

"I don't have much to add about the peasantry here, I think we're touching on it sufficiently in the other thread, and that will continue. The more I see the whole list of Marxist-Leninist criticisms, the more I can't believe I actually spent multiple years as a fellow traveler with the Trots. At least I have the excuse of having been a teenager at the time. Well, I used to be an anarchist, when I was first getting into leftist politics around age 16! Now I'm 19 and I've moved so much beyond that. I still can't believe I only have three years of leftism under my belt, though, the amount of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao that I've read is rather surprising to me. (Doesn't mean I remember it all, hehe) I have no clear line myself, as I don't belong to a party, union, or organization, but I just stick to Marxism-Leninism because it is both broad and specific enough as a methodology, and I find a lot of post-Leninist and post-Stalinist thought to simply misrepresent their works and contributions to argue there was a great divergence (that I just don't see) from them to Mao and after Mao, and then that thought underwrites historical and always-present complexities to create these source-free histories and hyper-particular essentialist ideologies that appeal to basically no one interested in socialism as a practical issue that could affect the day to day lives and institutions of working people the world over. I'm in a similar boat, except I find even ML to be too restrictive in certain things, but perhaps that's because I fail to dissociate Lenin from Leninism, that to be a Leninist means to agree with everything Lenin (and Stalin) did. Primarily, I'm not a huge fan of democratic centralism, because it seems to impose unity rather create it through recognizing diversity. Democratic centralism seems to say that at the end of the day, you're all proletarians, so the Party votes and you conform. Amin (maybe Aminist is a line??) writes that this is more vestigial from the second international, and not characteristic of Marxism, but the imperialist, chauvinist distortion. In a Maoist manner, Amin mentions that there are tons of contradictions among the people, and that it's important to recognize them and work to overcome them, rather than to ignore them, as democratic centralism would seem to have us do. Secondly, there's the whole question of imperialism that we've gone into, but there's a good case for developing without rejecting Lenin's contributions. On the other hand, 'Marxist' is too vague, and I don't want to be seen as one of those Euro chauvinists like that liberal darling Richard Wolff in the states. My anti-imperialist politics need to be front and center. The way I see it, socialism isn't on the agenda yet. That's a 20th century thought. We can create the conditions for socialism, etc. through radical anti-imperialist nationalism through mass based revolution and creating a DotP+P. Maoism falls into the trap of claiming universal appeal but only having China as a success story (I haven't studied them yet, but I've been told North Korea and North Vietnam were distinctly Marxist-Leninist, but also distinctly themselves as former colonies renewing their national identity). People can appeal to guerillas all they want, but until you have a state, and that state is as basically effective as the USSR was and the DPRK, PRC, and SRV presently are, and it lasts as long as any of those have, you're just guerillas in a preliminary stage of a revolution. As Lincoln said, it's easy to appreciate a man in a struggle. You reveal his real character by giving him power. It's true that things like the mass line and new democracy are not unique to Mao's thought, although those things are developments and universal contributions to Marxism Leninism. The problem is that Maoism is more than just Mao's contributions, it's a whole new tendency developed by people who weren't even Chinese or close to Mao. Mao's contribution, I've mentioned, that is most interesting to me is his reading of the dialectic, formally outlined in On Contradiction. It's not just a summary of Marx and Engels and Lenin, it contributes something new through the rejection of the 'synthesis.' Brilliant stuff, that's unique to Mao, I've seen. As far as the DPRK is concerned, they've never claimed to be Marxist Leninist. The follow Juche, which is not actually a Marxist ideology, yet has a lot of similarities to ML. It doesn't claim to be for export, it's a Korean phenomenon. MIM stands for Maoist International Movement (although it only existed in North America). They've since dissolved, but their thought lives on, notably through its preservation by MIM(Prisons). Arrighi seems interesting.

"You seem to be talking about the different rates of turnover of fixed capital. No, i'm talking about production rate. I'm not considering turn-overtime at all, this is only relevant as delay factor for starting up a production until it outputs product. Picture that the production is staggered , after every grape harvest new vats are added, until the first vat outputs wine and become available for a new batch of grape-juice. After the start up phase, it's just adding grape-juice in and taking vine out of vats, the difference for fine wine is that it will take twice as many vats for a given quantity of grapes transformed into wine. Sine at any given moment the fine wine production produces half the amount of wine, the fine wine production will require twice the amount of vats to produce equal amounts of wine than a cheap wine production. For any given quantity of fine wine it will therefor have twice the amount of embodied labour from vats transferred to them. Fine whine requires more labour, there is no mystery. do not the branches of production that experience longer than average turnover periods for their capitals have to charge—all else remaining equal—higher prices than capitals in those branches of industry that experience shorter than average turnover periods? No you can't directly compare different branches of production, the mode of comparing i used above only applies within a given industry, because realization varies over different industries, and the valued ad of an industries is not necessarily captured by that industry.",t3_a1sexi,communism

Remember, socialism isn't a welfare state, it's a workers state,and in its primary stage, working is paramount to socialists success, particularly in developing countries (ie, every socialist country ever). So, all the jobless welfare people that they moan a out in capitalist countries could be given a job under socialism... but they don't want that, otherwise the wages would increase because of a lack of Labor reserves.

"Damn I did this write up only to have the comment get deleted. I'm posting it anyways: Russia has had nothing to do with Marxism or Communism since 1991. Anything that their government is doing today really has nothing to do with that ideology. China on the other hand, is still ruled by a Communist Party and has been trying for a while now to change some of the conservatism around gender and sexuality that's existed in the country. This is even admitted to by the . It's important to note however, that just because a country is being led by a Communist Party, does not mean that conservatism no longer immediately exists within that society. Old ideas stick around for a reason - as you no doubt are aware of in the west - and are difficult to get rid of without a cultural revolution (these can get violent). China is a developing nation; in the last half century emerging from a previous century of brutal exploitation and backwardness, in this process it is making incredible economic and social progress and while the government has made many mistakes, these mistakes are learned from and have repeatedly resulted in reform or political consequence for those involved. China has managed to bring 800 million people out of poverty, have the largest emerging middle class in the world, the fastest growing economy, almost non-existent unemployment and homelessness and some of the most innovative and advanced public infrastructure of the 21st century. Is their still poverty? Yes. Is there still economic inequality? Yes. Is the party dedicated to solving these problems? Yes. What first world government can make any such claim towards the improvement of their citizens economic status over the past 8 years? Almost all economists agree that things are only getting worse. And before you compare a developing nation, which has existed and emerged from peasantry to a world superpower in just over 60 years. To countries like the US and the UK which had to engage in centuries of global colonialism, mass genocide, mass slavery, racism, sexism and the economic and militarist abstraction of wealth from third world countries forcing them into underdevelopment and stagnation would be just dishonest. To compare these countries primarily on their 'quality of life' (let alone their social developments) without considering these material factors is a great way to start seeing certain countries as 'inferior' and others as 'superior' because of perceived aesthetic and idealistic first world standards.",t3_a46yvn,communism

"You write the author sees the issue as 'a conspiracy of bourgeois nationalist leaders [which had] prevented the revolution from being what it could have been'. I find your usage of the term 'conspiracy' important here, because if the Cuban Communist Party really represented a national bourgeois position, and if development was as easy as the author implies, then why on earth would a Cuban bourgeois not chose to embark upon a path of capitalist development? It's precisely owing to the lack of the extension of industry that surplus profits could be made in what would result in diversification. Of course they'd answer that they're a comprador bourgeoisie, as they say in the article, but that seems logically silly because, in the first place, compradors don't make nationalist revolutions, and in the second place who on Earth could they even be connected to in our world without the USSR? More importantly of course, Cuba *has* experienced development to an extent the author of that piece wants to conceal (the author states Cuba's manufacturing industry produces nothing for the home market, that seems a little impossible given the embargo) which would be structurally impossible if they were subject to imperialist exploitation.

"I think you make a mistake here my man. First of all, leftism is a bad words, or was supposed to be, see:  Also, if you are referring to political action made by the people in a true communist state, the only one verity is the one people choose by themselves, for themselves. All Marxist theorical work is based upon a reality, which is the European one, especially the one from the 18 19th century, in which the bourgeois state and the capitalism exist. It's not supposed to be that way, but it is. Therefore, as a materialist philosophy, Marxism begin his work from this situation, but it doesn't mean that it Alway and every where have to be like this. For instance, China didn't had a bourgeoisie Revolution to put it society in a bourgeois state, therefore they had to adapt Marx theory to make all the conditions for a proletarian revolution to be in place by themselves. And it work. It mean that if suddenly, in a truly communist society, the whole people decide to call the Sun, the moon, then we will call the sun, the moon. I volunteerly took an absurd example, but it's because this stance that you defend truly is antiproletarian and antipeople, as it give the role of defining paradigm to a classes of experts, which is supposed to be formed, therefore is supposed to have privileges. It's deeply anti democratic. The aim is to give the people the Conditions for them to do whatever they want, because we should be living in a classless, stateless society, where all the power are supposed to be in people's hand. And I once again used the words people instead of proletariat, because in a communist society, class doesn't exist. It's only about the people. Therefore, refraining someone to expose his pov on a matter is not good if it's based upon the fact that he has not a Thesis in Political Science. It's the opposite, popular education as precognized in the Revolution Praxis should lead you to let all express their opinions, and correcting them with a well formed theorical explanation after that. And not blindly use a fallacious argument as the authority one, to make the people remain silent. Also you need to have believer in order to make a true revolutionary party, which is where we are back at nowadays, so spending time explaining why the proletariat should stfu and blindly follow you isn't a truly good idea.

In other words, given the curiosity between democracy and capitalism, how does a relationship arise and give itself to an inherently contradictory society?' I argued for socialism, and ultimately communism, as decentralized and democratic compared to capitalism with its comparatively centralizing and authoritarian power structures.",t3_a2vle4,communism

"Yes. What do you mean it's not an example of capitalist production? This is completely untrue. 'capital good' is a bourgeois economic concept, I am using Marx's terminology (constant capital). Besides, selling the barrel along with the wine, does not change the essence of the problem, and in no way makes it not a 'example about capitalist production'. Marx divides capital into constant capital and variable capital. Constant capital in this example would be the barrel and the ingredients, while the labour used in the process would count as part of variable capital. Your assertion that there is 'no capital' does not make any sense. BTW this is same example that stumped Ricardo. Ricardo (Quoted in Whitaker) said 'I cannot get over the difficulty of the wine, which is kept in the cellar for three or four years [i.e., while constantly increasing in exchange value], or that of the oak tree, which perhaps originally had not 2 s. expended on it in the way of labour, and yet comes to be worth £100.' He is simply responding to Ricardo's example.",t3_a1sexi,communism

It had some good parts and some weaker parts. I liked that it sought to analyze why these protests are so ideologically weak, rather than complain about it. But I didn't like how its conclusion was that it was the Left's fault for not organizing well enough. It seems to ignore the class dynamics as it relates to imperialism. The conclusion people like myself come to is that the protests are ideologically weak, not because the people are new to protesting and the Left is bad at organizing, but because the people protesting are of a certain relationship to imperialism that inhibits their willingness to hold onto far-left ideas. As the article claimed, a lot of it was petty bourgeois, and the petty bourgeoisie knows that its interests align with imperialism, even if they want more equal distribution of imperialist superprofits at home.",t3_a34zcu,communism

"Let me debunk you point by point. 1. “Nazism is actually left-wing (restriction of business, higher taxes, state controlled market)” No it isn’t. The Nazis were far-right. They were socially conservative in terms of women’s rights, LGBT rights, support of state religion, etc. They deregulated businesses and privatized most of the public sector of the German economy. Hell, the word “privatization” was coined to describe Nazi economic policy. Communists don’t support higher taxes, communists actually want to lead to the abolition of taxes along with currency and the state being abolished, it’s just that hasn’t happened yet. Also, Hitler stated in many of his speeches that he supports the protection of private property, something no socialist in the history of socialism has ever said. He had support from German industrialists, mainly the Krupps. He allied with conservatives in the Reichstag. . And also, an actual Nazi, Léon Degrelle, favorably compared US President Ronald Reagan, a **CONSERVATIVE**, to Hitler in terms of economic and social policy. Also, actual leftists (mainly members of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party and trade unionists not affiliated with the Nazi Party) were amongst the first to be thrown into the concentration camps. And Hitler purged and executed members of the Strasserite faction, which was the closest thing the Nazi Party had to a left-wing. 2. “If you truly support communism you should not attack Nazism…” Yes we should. Nazism wants communists and other socialists gone. Hitler constantly stated in *Mein Kampf* and his speeches that Marxism was a Jewish conspiracy to degrade the Aryan race, he even created the precursor to the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, Cultural Bolshevism. And also, why would a socialist like Stalin, who opposed private property in all forms, go to war with Hitler, who according to you, was also a socialist?  ",t3_a45e2j,communism

"Judging by your posting history, I think your a joke. And to answer your question, the primary reason most Marxist-Leninist states fell, was due to the massive amounts of sanctions and subversion from Western Capitalist countries combined with Counter-revolutionary traitors at home (i.e. Gorbachev). The five Marxist-Leninists states that survived, managed to do so by either adopting Market Socialism (China, Vietnam, and Laos), or isolating themselves from the global financial system (Cuba and North Korea). However, I wouldn’t get to excited about having us on the ropes yet, because, all it would take for Marxism-Leninism to have a major comeback would be either a major Global Conflict (the west is actively trying to start one with Russia and/or China) and/or a 1929 style Global financial collapse (this almost happened in 2008 if not for bank bailouts and Quantitative easing) to destabilize the Capitalist world, or if neither of these things happen, the slow rise of the PRC as a global superpower would give us a major advantage against the lethargic Capitalist West.",t3_a6d6xh,communism

I just knew he was a lawyer and he 'brought communism to Cuba.' Everyday I realize how very much I'm missing. I hated history in school because I thought it was boring, but I realize now that it was just boring because it was being taught as propaganda. In the US they try to teach history as a series of disconnected events. Memorize dates, names and locations but don't try to understand the context behind everything. As soon as you get the context you realize you're living smack dab in the center of the evil empire. I try not to ask questions directly, it's embarrassing how ill-informed I am, but I'm not very good at finding info about history and politics. I'm trying to bring myself up to speed. It's just hard to do when most of the info is buried in propaganda. When I specifically searched this question on google I got some bs false equivalency between Batista and Castro from someone who considers anti-communism a forgone conclusion. I'm not an intellectual, I'm just a person of middling intelligence feeling like I just woke up from the matrix. As for the significance, with no context, I honestly just thought it must be a lie.

Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration.[80] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War II—though president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain to overthrow its authoritarian regime.[81] It's literally in the wikipedia you said you read.

"My other comment is exclusively about the worker-peasant question, so I agree to keep it over there. I have to admit my 'conversion' was less theoretical. I was just reading basic historical scholarship and saw how fundamentally inaccurate my understanding of the Soviet Union was. I started with Kotz and Weir's Revolution From Above (1997) and then went back through their citations to find other basic histories (the shorter work of E. H. Carr was definitive for me, but I haven't read his major volumes yet). And while I was looking for a critique of Timothy Snyder's insanely reactionary work, I stumbled upon Grover Furr's Blood Lies (2014), and it almost broke my brain with the idea that you could just straight up defend the Soviet Union. And through him, I found Roland Boer and one of his fairly comprehensive articles where he offers like over a dozen or so mainstream counter-histories, and that solidified it. I randomly stumbled upon these subreddits and found an overabundance of counter-histories. Democratic centralism, as I understand it, means you have to respect the party (or local) vote after it has been made, but before the vote is made, there are periods where dialogue and debate is allowed (and even more so in participatory institutions like local unions, where mass debate was standard before a vote on local policy), but after a vote is held and a majority decision is clear, then there is a second vote where everyone votes the majority vote into a consensus vote, then there is a particular period of universal discipline to the majority decision, and after that, a new period opens up for another session of (party and local) dialogue and debate. It may have come about due to the particular pressures of Russian history, and I think it was broadly successful there, but I'm not dogmatic about it. If the Chinese do it differently, and it works as well or better for them, then more power to China. It could also be a difference of (Han-Slavic) values. Between a set period of agreed-upon discipline or constant allowances of diversity in a party or locality, I prefer the former. I think Amin's critique undermines the relation of mass debate periods with party discipline periods. It is ironic because Lenin likely would not have us venerate him (and Roland Boer argues that the sanctifying of Lenin and demonizing of Stalin in the Western left has its roots as the classic tale of Christianity, the betrayal of Jesus by Judas), but only to use his work more as a methodology of thinking up new ideas and frameworks. Between them, I do see Maoists argue for his originality and universality as applicable to every country (from India to Bolivia to Zimbabwe), whereas Leninists often underwrite Marxism-Leninism as a workable framework in many of these places, at least presently. And it seems to me, at least on here, that we Leninists are generally more sympathetic with 'revisionism' like China and Kerala and non-Marxist 'socialism' like Bolivia and Venezuela. I think 'imperialism' is an issue that we have to have caution with. On the Western left, it is becoming vulgar anti-militarism and obscuring class relations (and turning class questions, like 'urban-rural disparities' in China, into vulgar moral questions, and is doing so as a way of justifying 'radical' opposition to China). I offer this article as an  from Monthly Review about the economy (in its apparent prime) to get a better sense.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

The argument is that there in no way a revolution in the first world will be able to overthrow the bourgeoisie if it has to physically defeat the army of its country.

"Ok so, I’ll try and give it the way they taught me feel free to ask if you got any questions about anything in particular. So Breznev was a time of stagnation for the SU, he didn’t change anything but importantly for this story he allowed the reintroduced Russian nationalism into the SU to counteract Western influence. Brezhnev died and in quick succession Andropov and Chernenko died, this allowed for the election of someone who did not remember the great patriotic war or what Russia was before Stalin. The majority of the population where born after Stalin during Khrushchev or after were the match towards socialism ended and everything stagnated. So Gorbachev comes in and he’s a reformist thinking that the Soviet System can just in a day become open, he introduces perestroika and glasnost which lead to freedom of the press. He also thought that if he freed up control of the Soviet Satellites they would be so grateful and stay in the Soviet sphere. This freedom of the press after such long censorship lead to the proliferation of anti Soviet information and people thought it was true but also there was Chernobyl that caused people to lose faith. So now the stage is set Stagnation, no memory of the great patriotic war, Russian Nationalism, suddenly free satellite states and a man in power who had no idea the can of worms he opened up. The 3 most important republics in the SU were Belarus Ukraine and the Russian Federation, we will start with Belarus. Belarus: suffered the most in WW2 and so was most grateful for the SU’s liberation, they were a prosperous republic mostly based on industry. In Belarus the Communist Party were full of the old guard, loyal to the SU, the big hits in Belarus was Chernobyl which had a huge effect on the country and caused doubt, the old guard also feared the revisionism of Gorbachev and did not his policies to influence Belarus. During the Coup the Belarusian SSR supported the coup also the majority of the republic supported the referendum on staying in the Soviet Union. After the failed coup the Belarusian Popular Front (Nationalists) with the backing of protesters passed the legislation on the full sovereignty of Belarus from the Soviet Union. Ukraine: Ukraine has a strong nationalist history that infiltrated the communist party of Ukraine. It caused the faction in CPU called the “national communists” of which there leader Kravchuk was a part of. Glasnost allowed the Ukrainians to communicate with the Ukrainian diaspora which are fervently Nationalistic and the Chernobyl disaster caused Ukrainians to listen more to the Nationalists. So in Ukraine the Students revolt in Kiev and Kravchuk uses the popular support to stage a referendum on the sovereignty of Ukraine, this referendum comes back positive from all parts of Ukraine (some with a close margin in Crimea it was only 54% for) during the coup Ukraine backs Gorbachev and then after the coup declares independence. Russia: in Russia after Ukraine and Belarus made clear that they will succeed Gorbachev resigns and the CPSU suspended activities. The Baltic republics also declared independence and Armenia and Azerbaijan were in full war with each other, Yeltsin (back by the US and running on a campaign of Russian Nationalism) who was the most powerful in Russia at the time decided to dissolve the Soviet Union along wit Belarus and Ukraine. The Soviet Union formally stopped existing on December 8th and announced the creation of CIS (commonwealth of independent nations) which did not go very far because Ukraine wanted no part in it I hope that helps if any questions then feel free to ask!",t3_ab5tdo,communism

"like u/no_more_kulaks already pointed out , cryptos do not necessarily have to be heaters and for the dprk this is a way to bypass embargos, and possibly solve the age old problem of socialist countries how to get foreign currency for trade. ---- if you wanted to look at it from the point of view of system-analysis: * The dollar is primarily based on oil , military and traditional finance transaction system * The cryptos primarily are based on internet-cable-networks, micro-chip-factories and electricity supply the relative strength of these systems can be measured by their volatility, the stronger the lower the volatility. Meaning the cryptos are much weaker, the reasons for this are: * Bit-coin-enthusiasts will use the dollar to denote the exchange-value of a bit-coin, as in *1 bit-coin is worth x amount of dollars*, linguistically making the dollar the fiscal yardstick. (which IMHO is s strategical error on their part, if you want to be a currency you want to be the yardstick), this is about creating social-bias * the electricity companies, micro-chip factories, and electricity supply companies, have not understood that they count as systemic-leverage for cryptos and would have a privileged position comparably to what the US-military-industrial-complex has. To explain this you have look past monetary mystification, and look at it from the point of view of allocating resources and technical-talent. If they exploited the cryptos to increase what is allocated to them, it would likely result in strengthening the cryptos. Meaning the cryptos have unrealized systemic strength. * cryptos have a disadvantage in terms of popular accessibility and entrenchment in industrial supply-chain, and they are too complicated to use : *if you have to explain it it's not money.* I'm not a proponent of cryptos, because you have to pay the speculators, which means you have to redirect surplus or face the threat of divestment, with additional insecurity that is created by investor-irrationality and mistakes. Which are likely because speculation presupposes an irrational gambling mentality to begin with. So what about the dprk, can they benefit from the cryptos ? I would say yes, if they extract technical knowhow from this, and offer a protected hub for cryptos they might be able to increase material economic allocation, in the global context. From a socialist point of view the cryptos are striving towards extreme hardening of the IT-back-end,that back-end would also be usable for running a planed socialist economy. My prediction however is that not much of the potential will be realized, and that merely minor bypasses to the embargo will result from this. The reason for this is that the crypto scene is mostly populated by 'lolberts' that usually only think strategically on a personal level, and rare consider material and structural factors , and the dprk is likely to small to generate the necessary institutional depth to act as structural factor.

"I think he undeservedly gets a lot of flak from many leftists today. For example, some communists hold him up as a sort of Khrushchev or Gorbachev for transitioning China to a market economy. I don't think many MLs would have reservations about supporting the New Economic Period in the USSR. Lenin made a very good case for it as a strategic retreat from centrally planned socialism, particularly necessary for underdeveloped countries without a major period of capitalistic industrialization. The USSR certainly fit into this camp of underdeveloped, semi-feudal countries, as does China. The difference between the reforms introduced by Khrushchev/Gorbachev and Deng is that the former reintroduced elements of capitalist economic policies while weakening the hold of the dictatorship of the proletariat while the latter maintained the dictatorship of the proletariat. After all, Gorbachev was most certainly a liberal and Deng was a committed Marxist who based his reforms off of Lenin's. Deng's argument for opening their markets was essentially the theory of productive forces applied to China. Additionally, many MLs (and MLMs) don't acknowledge just how much power the state has over the economy. While state-owned enterprises don't comprise a majority of the economy or of employment, the ones that do exist often have a ton of control over their respective industry. There are still entire sectors of the economy under control of the Party. The firms that are privately-owned many times are accountable to the government or even partially owned by the state. I think I remember reading that China effectively controls around 70% of the economy, all things considered. And the results are speaking for themselves, China had the fastest growing economy in human history since the reforms. They opened up the door to dire foreign investment and international trade which has come to be instrumental to China's economic success. While it is certainly true that transitioning to a state capitalist economy under the DoTP had some drawbacks, namely the destruction of the Iron Rice Bowl and large increases in inequality, it has really invigorated Chinese industrialization, development, and growth. Overall, I think Deng was pretty solid in his analysis of China although he certainly changed certain parts of Chinese society for the worse. Political decisions, like the crackdown on protests at Tienanmen Square despite the supporters being largely pro-Party, even without regarding the Maoist protesters, come to mind when thinking of some of his mistakes.",t3_a1xp1g,communism

"i think you could better answer this question by asking yourself: what conditions prevail under capitalism which prevent full employment from being attained?  >The specifically capitalist mode of production, the development of the productive power of labour corresponding to it, and the change thence resulting in the organic composition of capital, **do not merely keep pace with the advance of accumulation, or with the growth of social wealth**. They develop at a much quicker rate, because mere accumulation, the absolute increase of the total social capital, is accompanied by the centralisation of the individual capitals of which that total is made up; and because the change in the technological composition of the additional capital goes hand in hand with a similar change in the technological composition of the original capital. **With the advance of accumulation, therefore, the proportion of constant to variable capital changes. If it was originally say 1:1, it now becomes successively 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 7:1, &c.,** so that, as the capital increases, instead of ½ of its total value, only 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, &c., is transformed into labour-power, and, on the other hand, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 7/8 into means of production. **Since the demand for labour is determined not by the amount of capital as a whole, but by its variable constituent alone, that demand falls progressively with the increase of the total capital, instead of, as previously assumed, rising in proportion to it. It falls relatively to the magnitude of the total capital, and at an accelerated rate, as this magnitude increases.** With the growth of the total capital, its variable constituent or the labour incorporated in it, also does increase, but in a constantly diminishing proportion. The intermediate pauses are shortened, in which accumulation works as simple extension of production, on a given technical basis. It is not merely that an accelerated accumulation of total capital, accelerated in a constantly growing progression, is needed to absorb an additional number of labourers, or even, on account of the constant metamorphosis of old capital, to keep employed those already functioning. In its turn, this increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of new changes in the composition of capital, of a more accelerated diminution of its variable, as compared with its constant constituent. ***This accelerated relative diminution of the variable constituent, that goes along with the accelerated increase of the total capital, and moves more rapidly than this increase, takes the inverse form, at the other pole, of an apparently absolute increase of the labouring population, an increase always moving more rapidly than that of the variable capital or the means of employment. But in fact, it is capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant population of labourers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the self-expansion of capital, and therefore a surplus population.*** ... The labouring population therefore produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, **the means by which it itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus population**; and it does this to an always increasing extent. **This is a law of population *peculiar to the capitalist mode of production*; and in fact every special historic mode of production has its own special laws of population, historically valid within its limits and only in so far as man has not interfered with them.** ... But if a surplus labouring population is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, **this surplus population becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalistic accumulation, nay, a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production**. **It forms a disposable industrial reserve army**, that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. **Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates, for the changing needs of the self-expansion of capital, a mass of human material always ready for exploitation.** marx then proceeds to discuss the role of industrial contractions and expansions, and the role of the reserve army of labourers in regulating the market for labour-power: >**Taking them as a whole, the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army, and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle.** >... >The industrial reserve army, during the periods of stagnation and average prosperity, weighs down the active labour-army; during the periods of over-production and paroxysm, it holds its pretensions in check. **Relative surplus population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works. It confines the field of action of this law within the limits absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to the domination of capital.** marx also outlined the same process in ch 16, vol 2, if his explanation above was too obscure: >In general such large-scale undertakings as railways withdraw a definite quantity of labour-power from the labour-market, which can come only from such lines of business as agriculture, etc., where only strong lads are needed. This still continues even after the new enterprises have become established lines of business and the migratory working-class needed for them has already been formed, as for instance in the case of temporary rise above the average in the scale of railway construction. **A portion of the reserve army of labourers, which keep wages down, is absorbed. A general rise in wages ensues, even in the hitherto well employed sections of the labour-market. This lasts until the inevitable crash again releases the reserve army of labour and wages are once more depressed to their minimum, and lower** relate this how a planned, socialist economy operates. >As a result of the replacement of the old bourgeois production-relations by socialist production-relations, the economic laws of capitalism, expressing relations based on the exploitation of man by man, cease to operate. The law of surplus-value, the basic economic law of modern capitalism, disappears from the’ scene. The general law of capitalist accumulation, the law of competition and anarchy of production, together with other laws, also disappear. The categories which express capitalist relations cease to exist: capital, surplus-value, capitalist profit price of production, wage-labour, the value of labour-power, etc. *  The law of planned, proportional development of the national economy is the regulator of socialist industry; distribution of means of production and labour-power among the various branches of socialist economy is effected on the basis of this law. This law requires: planned conduct of the national economy, proportional development of all branches of socialist economy, the fullest and most effective use of the country’s material, labour and financial resources.  do the same structural factors operate here to reproduce a reserve army of the unemployed? what about within the european feudal mode of production, or in the slave-owning mode of production? does unemployment exist in the same way within a capitalist firm? the assumption contained within your question seems to be that unemployment is a phenomenon external to the particularities of the mode of production within which it originates, rather than a structurally-determined phenomenon.",t3_aan8va,communism

"I'm not MLM anymore (was for a few years), but I can address a couple questions. People called themselves Maoist (or even Marxist-Leninist-Maoist) before the RIM 'declared' it, but it meant something different from what it does now. Then, it usually referred to someone who took China's side in the Sino-Soviet split. Now you have the followers of Sison, the Gonzaloites, the Avakianites, and others who proclaim to some sort of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. The one you see most online is probably the Gonzaloites, usually distinguished through adding 'Gonzalo Thought' to MLM or saying 'Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, principally Maoism'. For them, check out the RIM document  and the book *Continuity and Rupture* (by the same author). MLMs see MZT past the 'declaration' of MLM as revisionist, which is a word they really, really like. I, unfortunately, cannot address your concern about MLMs seeming ultra-left. As far as identity politics goes, there is a legitimate Marxist criticism of some sort of liberal identity politics, like the idea that one's identity determines how right you are, etc. For example, if I, as a woman, told someone that their analysis of something about feminism was worthless because they weren't a woman, that would be the type of liberal identity politics we should combat.

It started as a shower thought. My premise was that if liberalism is about treating everyone and everything as individuals, the deconstruction of systems in our analysis, then we can only treat perceptual knowledge. But by gaining a more systemic understanding of things like oppression will force liberals to become dialectical materialists. Unfortunately, most liberals have no need for dialectical materialism as they sit in their petty bourgeois privilege. They won't ever experience oppression as anything more than an individual act, hence why they won't adopt dialectical materialist analysis. I've also written some other brief stuff.

"The Cold War was not a war between good and evil like the Second World War had been. No, it was simply a war of imperialistic rivalry set upon the backdrop of ideology. The old superpower, the British Empire, had effectively collapsed after World War II - as three decades, characterised by two world wars and the great depression, slowly eroded it's economic power and social morale - this left a power vacuum on the world stage. After World War II, no country in Europe was in a fit state to fill his vacuum. Britain, France, Italy, Germany - all had been devastated by WWII and would be reconstructing for decades, some European countries are still suffering from the damage of WWII. At this point in time only two states existed that could project their power globally, the Soviet Union and the United States - and both wanted to do so. The United States had been preparing for the systematic dismantling of the British Empire since WWI, and from it's actions during WWII - these actions being the demand that Britain disband its overseas territories for aid - it was obvious that it was planning to usurp Britain's position as the dominant global power. The Soviet Union, of which was now in a state where it could attempt to exert its power, would not back down against the United States. Sure, ideology played a major role in the conflict, but the underlying source of the conflict was that both the United States and the Soviet Union wanted the position that Britain once held, and neither wanted to share. And despite what many people believe, the Cold War isn't over at all, not by a long shot - because the Cold War wasn't about Communism v Capitalism, it was about Russia v America, and it still is about that.

"I am not an expert, but as far as I know, collective farming was never centralized as industry was in the cities, and it was run like a tightly regulated market of farming cooperatives (meeting state requirements of products and supplies, but having greater self-management farm by farm), similar to the city enterprises after de-centralization (and you can look up the works of Bill Bland and Albert Szymanski if you ever want Hoxhaist and Khrushchevite descriptions of and perspectives on economic de-centralization after Stalin). Again, I recommend Tauger. 'Subjugation' is not exactly accurate. 'Adaption' is Tauger's framing, and I can see I'm unintentionally confusing you now. I think centralization was 'obvious' as in 'it was obviously the most effective in terms of achieving extensive and intensive productivity growth in Russia specifically,' but I did initially say, 'but what wasn't obvious was how to do that without triggering another major war' and that Russia did have a history of 'needing blood to change.' It took a lot of get the divided peasantry to adapt to collective farming. While rural centralization was a possible way of achieving greater economic efficiency, it required new political creativity (to prevent a new period of violence and the peasantry being divided over these issues again), and the Stalin leadership may have lacked that or needed more time to figure it out. I think your question is based in a particular dynamic that I'm not sure was the reality in the Soviet Union. I think there were as many groups in favor of collective farming as they were opposed to it, and that dynamic would have been exacerbated by another 25 being sent to centralize the collectives into unions and then federations of unions. Proletarian hegemony would rely on the allied peasantry favoring rural centralization, which itself was more than likely the same half of peasantry that was favoring, adapting to, and instituting collective farming years earlier. But again, extensive surveying, meaningful responses, creative education, and giving gradual access to participate in newly established democratic institutions would have been better, and taken longer, but the 'revisionists' unambiguously lacked the vision to figure it out (as a true Stalinist might have if he or she was given the time, but history isn't fair to visionaries). The more I see the whole list of Marxist-Leninist criticisms, the more I can't believe I actually spent multiple years as a fellow traveler with the Trots. At least I have the excuse of having been a teenager at the time. I have no clear line myself, as I don't belong to a party, union, or organization, but I just stick to Marxism-Leninism because it is both broad and specific enough as a methodology, and I find a lot of post-Leninist and post-Stalinist thought to simply misrepresent their works and contributions to argue there was a great divergence (that I just don't see) from them to Mao and after Mao, and then that thought underwrites historical and always-present complexities to create these source-free histories and hyper-particular essentialist ideologies that appeal to basically no one interested in socialism as a practical issue that could affect the day to day lives and institutions of working people the world over. Maoism falls into the trap of claiming universal appeal but only having China as a success story (I haven't studied them yet, but I've been told North Korea and North Vietnam were distinctly Marxist-Leninist, but also distinctly themselves as former colonies renewing their national identity). People can appeal to guerillas all they want, but until you have a state, and that state is as basically effective as the USSR was and the DPRK, PRC, and SRV presently are, and it lasts as long as any of those have, you're just guerillas in a preliminary stage of a revolution. As Lincoln said, it's easy to appreciate a man in a struggle. You reveal his real character by giving him power. The anti-China perspective precludes 'failure' as Trotskyists always preclude the Soviet Union as a 'failure.' It's a way to stay relevant, flex your Marxist muscles while never having to defend a revolutionary state, and never having to confront the complex realities of the 'backward' states in the Third World (because it might reveal uncomfortable things like the greater participatory democracy in China relative to the West, for example). It's a way to stay in First World comfort, but you always get a chance to uphold the idea that there was a 'real' revolution generations ago and that's what you defend because there's no real consequence now. It's just an academic exercise. The labor aristocracy is a good social relation to emphasize, as it helps remind young Marxists which conversations on the left are the ones where they need to become the predominant perspective. The Western left can play with 'radical-leftism' on basically any domestic policy, but it is always conservative on war and imperialism. Getting young Marxists to study revolutionary diplomacy (Arno J. Mayer, Gabriel Kolko, Bruce Cumings, Geoffrey Roberts) from sympathetic academics will definitely refine their ability to frame a diplomatically class-conscious Western anti-imperialism that doesn't reduce itself to a vulgar 'drone strikes in Yemen are bad' anti-militarism. I can't comment on MIM, as I don't even know what that stands for. And Unrhue is like a meme from 2011. I absolutely support reading Samir Amin and plan to read most of the books on his Wikipedia page. He's probably one of those early writers I found on Monthly Review that subtly provoked my quasi-Trost debate-guy mentality and made me think outside of my 'American precariat' existence.

Now, what she didn't mention is the 80/20 rule specifically, she only said 'with better looking men' but she should have specified with 'men who look better than themselves' and the only way those men would be with them is via hook ups, because why would a man more attractive than a woman stay with her, he will just use her for easy and quick sex.

"If it was true that the post-Stalin (and post-Mao) Central Committee was exclusively rural-based petit-bourgeois professionals and managers (the cliche characterizing of the Soviet leadership, but I do not actually know the class character of the collective Chinese leadership, from Deng to Xi), but one leadership got it right and one got it wrong, then it is just contingency. You could say that Chinese 'revisionists' have a vision and Soviet 'revisionists' just didn't. The underwriting of imperialism as the primary contradiction leads to the constant stressing of Soviet respect for formal detente, which itself leads the leadership to see unconditional surrender as their only option after internal rupture. Why did they underwrite it? The broad agreement in the post-Stalin leadership was to appease the West (with detente) and the peasantry (with a promise of no worker-peasant or inter-peasant war, and with it, a base equalization which particularly cut into investments of intensive productivity) at the same time while replacing heavy industry with light industry to avoid imperialist concentrations of wealth (from unequal exchange with Eastern Europe), but then promising workers imperialist-standards of mass consumption. GDP and per capita GDP stagnated, they saw their popularity or legitimacy fade, then they reformed, then that failed, and then they surrendered. I have to study their works to see their reasoning. It is a cliche to appeal to their class background to explain the lack of ideology, but there is that. It's just an impression, but Deng and Jintao seemed more open to experimenting with market reform while Xi seems more open to re-centralizing large sectors of the economy (with the pressures of trade unions and labor congresses under these 'new reforms'). Either way, their varying policies can and probably have caused greater or lesser disparities and greater or lesser conflicts of interests with workers and peasants, but all three understood the primary contradiction and pursued either with 'more markets' or 'more centralization' in negating that end. That broad agreement is likely the standard in the Central Committee. Why? You tell me. I think drawing that clear line between worker and peasant doesn't acknowledge the division of the peasantry over the question of collectivization. Marxist-Leninists may over-emphasize the kulaks, but everyone else forgets the reality that at least a third or up to a half of the peasantry had to actively participate (including monitoring and police collaboration) in order for that national policy to work. The belief in a unified and solid peasantry points to a real division while obscuring another and that just opens up more questions. If I remember correctly, Grover Furr argues that Mark Tauger (though I haven't found his statements or the evidence yet), as well as R. W. Davies and S. J. Wheatcroft (in their now definitive seven-volume work on Soviet industrialization, which I do plan to read), agree that a majority of the peasantry was in favor of early collectivization. If that is true, (and I can't say either way at the moment), it closes up that class binary as too artificial, and I see a lot of artificial binaries in the Mao-centric perspective. It is like people appealing to workers protesting Lenin (in the book Workers Again Lenin (1996) by Jonathan Aves) or workers protesting in China months ago and going, 'well, if there are workers protesting state policy, how can it be a workers' state?' You and I know that workers are not absolutely unified and solid as a class, but the majority are, and the majority of the peasantry too, and that primarily is what reveals the class nature of the state and society. I saw that as an article on Monthly Review, but haven't got around to reading it. Well, we're in a geopolitical agreement then, but we disagree elsewhere because we're seeing a different reality. You and Amin are basically appealing to the standard narrative of a broken, resentful, and opposing peasantry, but I'm not as sure about that. If the majority, or even half of the peasantry, was fundamentally fighting for collectivization and its success, and reproducing it daily, adapting creatively in its development and refining it, then there was a 'material basis' of peasants open for more education and dialogue between trade unions and collective farms, inter-peasant debate, and a gradual reform (democratic centralization and intensive modernization of agriculture), and while that 'basis' was in a large part of that lower class, it was not in the party (with early de-Stalinization), and here we go again: Stalin (and Xi soon in the future) acting like an aristocrat might have been the best way forward, personally vetting urban-based skilled workers heavily involved in organizing and representing trade unions and their federations, purging the 'revisionists' (and apparently, he was planning to, according to closed sources though, and I think it was J. A. Getty who suggested that), and basically reproducing the party structures of the 1930s, where (the book Communist Membership in the USSR (1968) by T. G. Rigby shows that) urban-based skilled-worker representatives were the majority of the party (with trade union and federation leaders in the Central Committee), and while just a plurality, the rate of collective farm-based representatives was always increasing in that decade and was always larger as a percent than professionals and managers. It could have been Stalin handpicking the best leaders and the best party, meeting the standards of political-administrative merit, popular legitimacy, creative strategy, coherent ideology, anti-imperialist vision, and having all that while achieving extensive and intensive material development (by building the social base to centralize agriculture with industry and modernize them together into a policy of competitive productive intensity with the West, which China could do in the future), but that required time or a Stalin protege (like a Russian Xi). This is the problem with appealing to one source. Amin is priceless, but he is Maoist in his thinking. He presumes answers to fundamental questions (maybe not knowing of the specialist literature of Tauger, Davies, and Wheatcroft) to make an artificial binary. For example, 'the worker-peasant alliance was broken by a worker-peasant war,' as opposed to the inter-peasant war that collectivization was (as a division within the class struggle of workers and peasants). And it obscures other implications, like with the Great Purges, where an inter-worker and worker-manager war killed and dispossessed a similar amount and percent of workers compared to the inter-peasant and peasant-rural manager war that killed and dispossessed peasants during early collectivization. That apparently didn't sever the worker majority as loyal to the party and state, so why is this worker-peasant conflict seen as essential? Because it's Maoist theory as assumed reality, not engagement with the specialist literature. And I'm not even saying your perspective is wrong (maybe mine is), but there is updated material to prove either perspective correct and appealing to a theory-cliche isn't helping the historical question (which seems to me, an issue of an administrative leadership, placed there by chance and sharing a similar class background with the Chinese leadership, but lacking Chinese ideological creativity or vision, and not an issue of Soviet society lacking a 'material basis' of willingness to engage with reform among a large part of the peasantry). 'Perhaps it can be argued that this is where a radically new understanding of imperialism could come in handy to change the way we interact on the world stage, such that imperialism doesn't threaten the worker-peasant alliance.' And I agree, but only if I find a specialist perspective that actually proves the division was fundamentally worker-peasant, as a plurality class and majority class with distinct disparities and conflicts of interests, and not between the ideological and entrepreneurial class of the leadership (David S.

"I really shouldn't waste time and energy on this, but my alternative is being depressed over climate change, so what the hell. Women's biology is different to mans. This is a fact that is acknowledged by all the experts who study evolutionary science, including female scientists. Women's biology is different. Without wanting to be transphobic, this is generally pretty obvious. And brain scans do support this to some extent. Interestingly, though. The variation between different women (or men) is greater than the variation between sexes, so the biological differences between men and women should have as much impact on society as the differences between tall and small people. Society must account for these differences and be set up in a way for efficiency and fairness to be possible. Okay, fair enough, I guess. I do question what you mean by efficiency and fairness in this context. Pair-bonding isn't generally considered something that must be done efficiently in human societies, and you talk of fairness while also wanting to massively restrict a woman's freedom, but leaving a man's freedom untouched. Weird. It is not as black/white as radical 3rd wave feminist has brainwashed you to believe it is. Cool. What I am saying is based on biological facts and realities, not 'incel,' you are just creating a strawman. It is you who is a brainwashed militant of an illogical, selfish group called 3rd wave feminists who are imploding Western civilization as we speak. If it talks like an incel, and walks like an incel... Look, maybe you've looked in this issue yourself and came to this conclusion, but when your argument is indistinguishable from far-right youtubers, some self-reflection needs to happen. And Western civilization deserves imploding. That shouldn't be controversial on this subreddit. The fact that 10 000 years of patriarchy ALLOWED human civilization to HAPPEN and flourish is proof that it works. I have never seen any evidence that humanity before the agricultural revolution was anything but radically egalitarian. After that, women were treated as second-class citizens until relatively recently those ideas got challenged and equality actually became an important ideal. And patriarchy didn't allow civilization to happen. That's (a) not true, and (b) a non-argument. The fact that 3rd wave feminism is DESTROYING the earth in the short span of only 10 years which it has been in mainstream power is proof that this is a toxic and dangerous ideology. How is third wave feminism destroying the Earth? Last I checked, the oncoming climate catastrophe is the most likely candidate for humanity's destruction, and that process started long before women even had the right to vote. You lack the foresight now, but you will see what I said is true then. Again, a non-argument. Also, I'm not worried. My wife is currently on a date with another man and she still enjoys our relationship on every level. Plus, I can easily date a man, if your scenario ends up true. \* sigh \* You're not even fun to argue with, because you provide no arguments worth talking about. Your argumentation boils down to: 1. The way we have lived before will always be superior. 2. Third wave feminism is evil. Those aren't arguments. Those are statements that you fail to back up.

"You could say that Chinese 'revisionists' have a vision and Soviet 'revisionists' just didn't. I wouldn't say that. This is idealism. I prefer to find the material bases for revisionism. I also don't really care to refer to the Chinese leadership as revisionist, because it was qualitatively different from the Soviet leadership. The Soviet leadership restored capitalist ideology. The Chinese leadership allowed some capitalism, but only under People's Democratic leadership. Ever since I've gotten involved in Marxism Leninism, I've spent the whole time looking for the 'answer' to why revisionism arose in the USSR. I first encountered the personality argument (and associated with it, the class argument), the wrong people came to power. I rejected it outright. I then encountered the argument that there was elitism in the Party, which separated the masses from the Party. I held this line for a while, but I never really believed it. It doesn't provide any plan to action for the future. It's like the appeal to equality arguments from leftcoms, except being used by MLs not to denounce Stalin but to denounce Khrushchev. I ultimately came to some individual conclusions on the matter related to the notion of *professional* revolutionaries, and how it is an inherently petty bourgeois profession, and so it can be expected that petty bourgeois and bourgeois ideas would emerge from it, unless the professional revolutionaries can follow the mass line and institutionalize their dialogue with the masses. I still find that this holds some validity. Then there's the case presented by Amin about proletarian instead of People's democratic leadership, which certainly seems plausible as well, but will require more research on my part before I'm willing to hold onto it as my own line. Ultimately, there's one argument that no one seems to be mentioning that may be the most convincing, and in line with Amin's 'Long View of History.' Lets make an analogy to the French Revolution. It began with lofty goals of equality for all, radical social change, even utopian. It was even led by the then embryonic proletariat at times. But as we know, it degenerated into what could be called revisionism. The Thermidorian reaction. In hindsight, we can see that the conditions to establish communist utopia did not exist at the time. Back to 1917, a similar argument can be made that the ultimate failure of the Bolshevik Revolution to sustain itself was because its goals were too lofty and its perspective too advanced, looking too far into the future, was too progressive for its material conditions. It's worthy of more research, but it is certainly in line with the modern ML approach to analysis. I definitely agree that the Chinese have maintained a more thorough view of imperialism and have been willing to work with internal bourgeois forces at times, which is wholly appropriate. The bourgeoisie isn't all 'bad.' Even if the armchair Maoists who claim to care about what Mao had to say disagree. I don't want to play defendant for Amin, but your criticisms don't really hold up. He's a lot more nuanced on all of these subjects than I present him to be. He had some Maoist influences (and an awful line on social imperialism back when it was relevant), but I currently have many Maoist influences. The simplification into binaries is a problem on my part, not on his. I've read many of his books, and he really offers the nuance that I'm not trained enough to provide. Ultimately, I cite Amin for some of my arguments, but I do diverge from him on points of nuance. For example, he offers a more nuanced view of the current Chinese leadership than probably you or I would. For him, at least five years ago when he wrote the essay, it was very much an open question as to whether China would go comprador or continue down the national road. Perhaps he would have changed his view. I do intend on expanding my reading list, but I've gotten so busy lately. Not enough time to read.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

" If this Polanski person was subject to powerplay then the rape case was just an instrument for that. No justice can be had this way, because justice cannot be had as secondary objective hitched to something else. The reason for that is simple: the rule that would be derived from this is that rape is a crime only if the rapist pissed of powerful people. Creating a very selective legal deterrence against rape, leaving most women unprotected. While creating a false public appearance of functioning justice. In this case arguing for lenience for a rapist amounts to rape apologia, while arguing for prosecution amounts to serving somebodies alternate agenda, and promoting selective justice. Basically it's a trap, if you engage with it and accept the premise that this is a trial about rape, you already lost. If you wish to engage in political struggle to help rape victims, fight for effective measures like safe-houses, legal-funds, ... You know that there is the possibility that the author really despises the 'liberal purge circus' to such an extent that they got baited into rape apologia, which is even worse. ---- All that said WSWS is anti war, and for that stuff they should still be recommended",t3_aaaiiq,communism

"If by the siege mentality you mean, conspiracies theories (eg the Jews control the world etc, 'yahoodi sazish' etc), as someone from that geographical area, I can attest that those POVs are much too common. Interestingly enough, to me it seems that they are held more commonly by more 'educated' people (teachers, professors, bureaucrats, white collar workers), Holy crap, you sound like you could be talking about my father. He believes 'yahoodi' control the world, imperialism is nothing more than a Zionist conspiracy, blah blah blah, and yet has a degree from an Ivy League university. In fact, in my former community several people were highly educated (again, they grew up bourgeois in Pakistan, Egypt, or Lebanon) and yet they too held these beliefs. >But what they learn in school is the complete opposite, (ie superiority of 'Islamic Civilisation', Communism was bad etc). Thus the only way they can reconcile the present state of affairs with the lofty ideals is by thinking of a grand conspiracy. Very much so. I'd also add that in this case, you have old cultural relics like the honor/shame obsession whereby you *have* to maintain your honor (and family's honor) at all costs.

"Well, first of all, it's not my definition of communism, it's *the* definition of communism. Communism is a stateless, moneyless, and classless society. so your idea of communism is just flat-out wrong. Now, I won't hold this against you, since unless you specifically looked into this, you'd be given misinformation all your live. Now, what I will hold against is that you think you can come into a space dedicated to an idea and just assume that you know better than the rest of the people here. That's just supremely arrogant. Anyway, what does communism actually mean: *Stateless* In a communist society, there would be no more states or governments. Now, I'm an anarchist, so this is a big one for me. Decisions would no longer be made by the powerful, but directly by the people who are affected by those decisions. Under capitalism, the state protects the powerful at the expense of the workers. That's why you see the police firing tear gas at workers on strike, but never intervene when a boss shuts down a workplace. **Moneyless** In a communist society, everyone will receive basic necessities (food, shelter...) no matter what, and everything else will be freely shared as much as needed. Different communists disagree on how this would actually work, so I won't go too deep into this, but the idea is that things that are plenty don't need to be hoarded but can be given to everyone that needs it. **Classless** All Marxist tendencies evaluate the world through a lens of class analysis. Under capitalism, there are two important classes: the owning class (also called the bourgeoisie) and the other class are the workers. The Bourgeoisie owns the means of production (basically, everything that is used to make goods), which is a very powerful position to be in, since it allows them to have people work for them. Workers don't have those means of production, generally speaking, so they are forced into employment in order to survive. This gives us the society we have today, where a lot of people are working very hard for relatively little rewards, whereas the people who do nothing but own stuff need to do relatively little in order to massively increase their wealth. In a classless society, the means of productions are communally owned by the workers using them, allowing them to reap the full rewards of their labor. The function of the bourgeoisie is useless for pretty much everyone (except for the bourgeoisie, of course). All they need to do is 'have stuff,' which isn't actually meaningfully contributing to society. Hope that helps.",t3_a4fqcz,communism

"Wasn't this naive perspective fairly universal back in the day though? I mean, the perspective of 'socializing and politicizing science and technology' was apparently controversial across mainstream academic disciplines two decades ago, and probably is now. I believe so, yes. This criticism that Amin makes is really about a failure of the Third International to wholly dissociate from the Second, this 'seed of a choice' being one part of that. I liked that article you shared. I especially like this one sentence I've pulled from it. 'So the issue is not whether reality exists, but whether knowledge of it is 'transparent.' Brilliantly stated! As I mentioned, I don't really agree with this criticism of Amin on this point like I used to, but I still found it interesting. I totally understand that catching up is itself a revolutionary goal, and the contradiction between building an alternative and catching up is not as antagonistic as he claims. Arguably, it's not even a contradiction, as they are in one sense the same! Catching up is an alternative modern capitalism-imperialism. You can't place that lack of vision and inevitable failure on Leninism. I agree. It places too much importance on the potential ideological roots of revisionism instead of the material origins. Ideology can and does change, sometimes drastically. They weren't even holding onto much of Leninism by the Perestroika period. On the material origins, the proletariat-peasantry alliance and the lack of systematic democratization of political and otherwise social life remain the two that I find most convincing.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

"It is widely understood that the U.S. has more formal freedom of speech than any First World country, but is easily the least social democratic of them. I'm not sure how you deduce that formality helping lead to socialism. Nor does that formality prove that U.S. political subcultures (identitarian college students and their white suburban middle-class professional and small business owner families) are less 'authoritarian' than the subcultures in China (the tens of millions of rural and urban workers participating in trade unions and labor congresses). Also, I recommend you read  by Frederick Engels. Authoritarianism is not an invalid concept if you're a liberal or conservative, but it is explicitly a post-Marxist (or even anti-Marxist) concept, as it effectively obscures what you're obscuring in your comments. The fact is that in every country (whether or not they're threatened by external forces), there is a perpetual class struggle where the classes themselves are (in broad sociological terms) socially understood (not formally recognized by laws) as hegemonic political forces competing for economic policies and programs (if not whole systems) benefiting themselves exclusively. Capitalists (and their middle-class subordinates in corporate bureaucracy and Congress) stagnate real wages and lobby to cut real social expenditures because it's necessary to achieve progressive rates of return in profit. 'Authoritarian measures' like strikebreaking and mass arrests happen in extreme cases because they're necessary, not because they're social or institutional lapses from a superior libertarian culture that China doesn't have. And if wage stagnation becomes wage decline and trillions of more dollars in public funds, pensions, goods, and services are sold by way of tax cuts to capitalists and their middle class to privatize more of the global employment and investment structure, working-class insurgency and reactive middle-class 'authoritarianism' will become more necessary, and larger and more common, and universal. Also, you could read the book Decentralized Authoritarianism in China: The Communist Party's Control of Local Elites in the Post-Mao Era (2008) by Pierre F. Landry. Workers in China have far more control in their day to day lives and institutions than American workers, but it is the centralizing (or 'authoritarian') funds, protections, and structures given by the Communist Party that allows those democratic experiments in trade unions and labor congresses to even happen. That is what we call dialectics. And neither the United States or China are going to escape those contradictory dynamics of governing because they have more or less formal rights like freedom of speech. Your position of prizing formal rights like direct voting (which isn't exactly how it works in the United States) over the real goal of achieving proletarian hegemony in the class struggle is exactly why socialism has never happened and probably never will happen in the First World, short of losing most of its wealth through large-scale Second and Third World nationalization programs. You could vote in a Congress full of warehousers, truck drivers, dishwashers, bartenders, janitors, and nurses tomorrow, but they would get about as much done as the lawyers and businessmen already there. Having the ability to directly vote in those particular individuals (I see AOC is becoming a major personality) means little if there is an entire formal system (for example, the over-bureaucratizing of the voting process, which is now done by both parties in the United States to keep half of the country uninvolved, as it would open up chances for European-style coalition politics and more leverage for minority positions, whether progressive or reactionary) designed to make sure they can't achieve and maintain consistent supermajorities in both houses of Congress, and even that situation is presupposing these workers are the most ideologically advanced and committed, politically aware, and personally austere workers we can get in those party positions, as we got them in the Bolshevik and Soviet Industrial Revolutions.",t3_a65rsv,communism

Syria is the last remaining old school Arab nationalist country, controlled by a government that recognizes the role of Western imperialism and strives toward a secular social democracy rater than some type of religious conservatism. The governments seeking the overthrow of this country (US, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, France) have clearly imperialistic ambitions over Syria and have funded some absolutely horrific fundamentalist militias to do so, including ISIS. Anarchists will tell you that the only 'good guys' are the YPG because of their anarchist ideology, but this simplistic worldview neglects the ways that the imperialist US military influences the YPG leadership and even establishment permanent military bases on YPG-held Syrian soil. The YPG has very complicated relationships with the the Syrian government as well as Russia, and is now racing to strengthen these bonds since Trump announced the US withdrawal. There are clearly also ethnonatioanlist elements within the YPG, but these elements seem more prominent among the Syrian government, which after all is explicitly Arab despite the presence of large non-Arab minorities.

"I was exclusively arguing for a democratic centralization of unions in Soviet agriculture (as that is what worked in the cities and was probably a historical necessity) being the 'obvious way to go' because I think it helped contextualize the deeper problems of Russian history (perpetual geopolitical threat and inter-clan violence escalating inter-class violence, as M. T. Poe argues in The Russian Moment in World History, 2003, and J. A. Getty argues in Practicing Stalinism, 2013). What existed in its stead? Were unions decentralized in agriculture? Nonexistent? If we pursue from the premise in the first half of the thread that the dictatorship of the proletariat subjugated the peasantry, rather than ally itself fully with the peasantry in a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, could it be said that democratic centralization of agricultural unions would have solved the problem? Given the peasantry a functional presence that did not exist otherwise? Or would it simply have served as part of the rest of proletarian class hegemony over the peasantry? I was just pointing to the absurdity of being a Bukharinite. It is less absurd than being a Trotskyist though. Well, it's certainly outlandish to be a Bukharinite in the modern era, even if Bukharin had some good ideas. And yet Trotskyists exist, while Trotsky didn't have good ideas, and was just a total opportunist. I honestly don't know where the lines between Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong Thought, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and Third Worldism ever draw themselves and become distinct. It's like I have radically different pictures of who Mao was from these and other perspectives, and don't know where to place him or his contributions in Marxist history. I have a similar issue. I've been struggling to find an appropriate line. I try not to be individualistic and say that I have unique ideas, above the fray, whatever. But all of the relevant tendencies fall short. Marxism Leninism is imperfect, as it was developed a hundred years ago and we've learned a shit ton more since then. (That being said, MLs are often best to organize with because they tend to be less dogmatic than Hoxhaists, Maoists, and others.) MLM has the upside of recognizing Mao's contributions, like mass line, PPW, New Democracy, and my favorite, his further development of dialectical materialism. (It's a tradition, or a science, not theorized by one man but over the course of many years, like any other science.) But then MLM is also super dogmatic and ultra and they have this 'cultural revolution or bust' attitude, which really harms their ability to look at China objectively. 'If it's not perfect it's bourgeois.' Excuse me, no. MLMTW has the benefit of taking Mao's contributions, but also recognizing the alliance between first world white labor and imperialism. It has the same downside as MLM, plus it's never been formally theorized. Recognizing the alliance between FW labor and imperialism seems to be the only thing third worldists agree on. The rest of it is amorphous. And on a side, ML-MZT is not really an independent strand of Marxism, it's just ML applied to Chinese conditions. I've been reading into MIM thought, hoping to find a similar line to MLMTW without the downsides. It's formally theorized, which is a huge plus, and they're not armchair revolutionaries, they organize, even though they recognize that the majority of the first world is labor aristocracy. They know we are a minority, but don't let them do nothing as many third worldists do. (Can't stand Jason Unruhe for example.) It seems to have a good line for U$ conditions, but they do uphold the cultural revolution, reject market reforms unconditionally, etc. So it has the same problems as MLM, I'm finding. What a mess, and I apologize for rambling. I'll definitely check out the debate you cited. On imperialism, you raise some good points. You're gonna kill me for citing Amin again (I can be obsessive, I just cling to one thing and just do it, if I discover Amin, I read all of his books before I move on, and he'll be my go to for a new idea until I discover someone I find more interesting). Anyway, Amin said in passing in something I read, no clue where, that people often equate industrialization/urbanization with development, but this is not the case. Now me talking, look at Brazil for example. IIRC around 90% of its population is urban, but it can hardly be considered developed. It's still very much of the periphery.",t3_a6uhyu,communism

We're just beginning to feel the failures of capitalism here thanks to the way various industries were deregulated under our last conservative government (which the current liberal government hasn't reversed). I suspect, like with most things, we'll be slow to growing more comfortable with socialism as a country but, luckily for us, we are already pretty on-board with the idea of social democracy which could be a handy stepping stone to socialism. We definitely do not have much in the way of anti-socialist propaganda here. All that we tend to have is a small vocal minority who like to shout anti-socialist slogans from the 1960's that don't make much sense in this age or this country (since they are American slogans). Most of their 'arguments' amount to just declarations like 'socialism doesn't work!'

"So obviously fuck US imperialism in the middle east, but we really need to be more careful with casually calling people 'fake leftists' just because they might still hold some wrong opinions that are almost certainly shaped by being submerged in liberal, capitalist, imperialist propaganda literally from birth. Likewise there is a possible nuanced take here that goes something like 'Yes Mattis is bad, but whoever Trump replaces him with will be even worse since that administration is borderline fascist' or 'The US was supporting a leftist group' or whatever that isn't necessarily completely wrong. Yes imperialism is bad. Yes Trump is bad. Yes every neoliberal politician is bad. But there are shades of bad and some of them are preferable to others. There is definitely a world in which someone with genuinely leftist sympathies could make an argument like that. Personally I agree with you and those reasonings are dubious, but I could at least see an argument being made in good faith. It would be better to just make a thread educating people about why they're wrong on that subject, not just sending them to the wall and declaring them counter-revolutionary class traitors or whatever. Most people born in a liberal country, especially the US, take a while to realize the depths of their indoctrination and peel back the layers dumb shit that they never even realized was dumb, and we should help them to do that rather than cast out anyone who isn't a perfect Marxist-Leninist with insane purity tests, as if everyone was born with a copy of the Manifesto in their hand.

America has an extremely powerful culture, a huge portion of the world consumes our culture such as movies, music, clothes, etc. we also have very attractive ideology like freedoms liberty and equality, even though our government barely practices any of it, we’re very good at projecting it in a really powerful way. Meanwhile China doesn’t have the same powerful and attractive culture being imported all over the world, and its government (at least as far as I’ve been told) is pretty cruel corrupt and it’s becoming increasingly capitalist. Their sweatshops they’ve allowed American corporations to establish and use to exploit their workers to their deaths aren’t exactly something the world wants.

These people can not have anything in common with our Party. They are renegades and hypocrites who must be expelled from the Party. Not achieve the elimination of classes with the weakening of the class struggle, but its amplification to the final annihilation of all other kinds of agony, and organizing to defend the country against capitalist encirclement is not to be annihilated.” I had never seen this before. Interesting to hear. Nevertheless, the practice of the USSR at the time acted as if the class struggle had ended, the purges targeting 'traitors,' rather than bourgeois per se. In fact if you look at the internal politics of the Soviet Union it seems that Stalin was outnumbered by the revisionists. I mean Nikolai Voznesensky who was involved in the Leningrad Affair was the Chairman of GOSPLAN! He was also the Deputy Premier! It wasn't just Khrushchev as we discussed earlier the revisionists were everywhere! Again, hadn't heard of this. Certainly the revisionists were growing in number, because there was a material basis for revisionism, as we've been discussing. Why would you say Lenin's view was idealistic? Because it's upholding a vision of a utopia (that of what socialism is supposed to look like) rather than simply doing what the class struggle necessitates in any given moment. It's minor, so I'd like not to harp away on this.",t3_a5uuwt,communism

A dialectical materialist approach to the interpretation of religious texts, in fact, redeems religion from the backwardness of liberalism.

To achieve this goal requires the total liberation of the Proletariat throughout the world, and as more countries begin to change to having Communist leaders, the country moves to Socialism which is a transitionary period before Communism is achieved. There has never been a Communist Nation (it's an oxymoron) but Communist theory have helped shaped the governments of the USSR, Cuba, DPRK, Venezuela, China, Vietnam and many more to varying degrees. Some of these countries like the USSR were very socialist, and lifted millions out of poverty while fighting off the Nazis.

Read Lenin’s “Better Fewer, but Better” and you will get to the root cause of the problem. Had Lenin lived, he might have tried to end his own theory (but thats still a speculation), we have to look forward and devise means that could smash current existing relations of production.

"Im not trying to be rude but you should really refresh your literature if that is your idea. Communism is a dialectical step that will change the way society works in its basis. It is the utter negation of societal structure as we know it. That is only definable in the historical context in which marx and engels brought it up. The contradictions of capitalist mode of production and society will be resolved in a higher state of society, the same way slavedom and feudalism where overcome. The dissolution of the owning class, the burgeoisie and thus this specific conflict is defined as socialism. That doesn't mean eternal happiness, but rather another step towards a free society. This movement will be culminating in communism which is defined as a classless (thus a lack of class conflicts), stateless,moneyless and ownershipless society. Communism is not an ideology, although you could describe marxism as one, but yes most communist support socialist states like the USSR as they bettered the life of their citizens, after the revolution and where on the right track up until the liberalisation of their countries which have left millions in poverty up until today.

This isn't pessimism but let us not equate distaste for work with having a material interest in revolution. There is a lot of work to be done, including a lot of work to be done in the united states. However, the u.s. population is not just inches away from revolution. This is an immature sentiment. And this isn't 'left communism' this is Leninism, as echoed in 'Imperialism and the Split in Socialism': There's a reason the revolutionary activity is not in the imperial core.

These organizations also have a history of infiltration and so we should be suspicious of road-to-Damascus converts or people who conceal their past. **Wrong take** Military and police have no place in Revolutionary politics. ---- This is a divisive topic, and in fact I think it helps to have some historical perspective here: this very issue nearly tore apart the original Russian Communist Party, when the question of using 'military experts' (Tsarist officers brought into the Soviet military) became heated. My own view is that the history speaks for itself. I can't imagine a version of the history of the USSR where the Latvian Rifles were dispensable before the civil war or where credible commanders like Tukachevsky were set aside during it. And at least in a US context, I actually think there's a lot of latent potential in the military for a number of reasons, including familiarity with the concept that equitable government management of the economy (in the US the military is basically a parallel society run by the government -- one could provocatively claim that it basically is a centrally-planned economy having in mind many of the same goals as a civilian version and nestled inside a capitalist country) isn't so bad, after all, along with a sort of cultural disdain for useless warts on the ass of the universe like the Koch heirs or any other billionaire.
