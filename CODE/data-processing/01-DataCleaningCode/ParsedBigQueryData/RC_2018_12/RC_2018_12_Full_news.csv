"Full text of NPR’s correction: Editor's note: An earlier version of this report mischaracterized an answer Donald Trump Jr. gave to Senate investigators in 2017 about the prospective projects his family was negotiating with people in Moscow. The story reported that Trump Jr.'s response — that negotiations on one project concluded by the end of 2014 — contrasted with the version of events as laid out in the guilty plea by Michael Cohen on Thursday. In fact, Trump Jr. and investigators were alluding to a different set of negotiations — not to a deal that Cohen was reportedly pursuing. Trump Jr. did acknowledge in his testimony that Cohen and another man were exploring a possible deal in Moscow in 2015 or 2016. Trump Jr. did not address what Cohen has now admitted — that talks about such a deal continued at least into June 2016, longer than previously known and well into the presidential campaign. I do love how Fox tries to make a big deal out of other news agencies doing their job correctly tho. The concept of honest journalism is so foreign to them. ",t3_a25fd2,Full_news

"**Washington Examiner** The Washington Examiner is an American political journalism website and weekly magazine based in Washington, D.C. that covers politics and policy in the United States and internationally. It is owned by MediaDC, a subsidiary of Clarity Media Group, which is owned by Philip Anschutz.From 2005 to mid-2013, the Examiner published a daily tabloid-sized newspaper, distributed throughout the Washington, D.C. metro area. At the time, the newspaper mostly focused on local news and political commentary. The local newspaper ceased publication on June 14, 2013, and its content began to focus exclusively on national politics, switching its print edition from a daily newspaper to a weekly magazine format.The Examiner is known for its conservative political stance and features many prominent conservative writers. *** **Center for Immigration Studies** The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) is a non-partisan, non-profit organization and think tank 'that favors far lower immigration numbers and produces research to further those views.'Founded in 1985 as a spin-off from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the center's self-described mission is to provide immigration policymakers, the academic community, news media, and concerned citizens with reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States. CIS is one of a number of anti-immigration organizations that John Tanton helped found.Reports published by CIS have been disputed by scholars on immigration, fact-checkers such as PolitiFact, FactCheck.Org, Washington Post, Snopes, CNN and NBC News, and immigration-research organizations. The organization has been cited by President Donald Trump on Twitter, and used by members of his administration.Critics have accused CIS of promoting and having ties to nativists which CIS denies. *** ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",t3_a2p7a6,Full_news

You're trying to make a connection to Nazi camps and our BP agents I'm not having any of it. It's on the parents not the agents. I'm not about to risk our agents lives because some kids might cry for 20 minutes. If it's the safest way to disperse a crowd who is showing aggression and intent to harm then I would support them using tear gas 10/10 times. If this was mostly kids? Sure go with that term.
