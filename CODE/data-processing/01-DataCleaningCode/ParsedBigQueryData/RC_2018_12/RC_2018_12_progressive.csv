"Article excerpt: >Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes, head of the task force that is putting together the legislation, concurred. “H.R. 1 is not being built for Mitch McConnell,” Sarbanes said. “It’s being built for the American people.” Unfortunately, the American people don’t control the Senate floor calendar. Mitch McConnell does. And the subtext of these indirect answers about “the people” is a pretty direct answer: No, obviously Senate Republicans aren’t going to do anything with this, and Democrats will hold that against them in the 2020 campaign. McConnell, in a Wall Street Journal interview Monday night, confirmed that he wants nothing to do with the bill, putting it in the bucket of measures House Democrats would try to pass “knowing full well that I’m not going to take them up.” H.R. 1, he said, is “not going to go anywhere in the Senate.” Pelosi had been anticipating this. “Democrats ran and won a resounding victory in part on our commitment to restore integrity in Washington,” Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, told me. “We are more than happy to make the issue too hot to handle for those who try to obstruct the clear will of the people.” **C-SPAN:** ",t3_a8v7ck,progressive

No one wants to believe that, with the environment and (especially) economy going to shit, that people won't get desperate and side with a dictator who promises to protect them from boogeymen. People don't want to see how the Nazis and Bolsheviks took power by pointing fingers then executing their 'oppressors.' He has all the trappings of a wanna-be dictator, he has instituted a power structure that allows him to effectively destroy necessary parts of a democracy. He's been tanking environmental regulations, DeVos is slowly crippling education, he's destroying the economy, the list goes on. All of this has been a systematic dismantling of American Democracy, and our public has their heads so far up their asses that they think voting will fix this. It'll take decades to even this single term back out. Just this one presidency has done so much damage that it won't be apparent immediately, but it will still take decades to undo. On the other hand, we deserve a dictator who destroys this country. We've voted against our best interests for decades, allowed businesses to seize governmental power, and we've decided to take less interest in how our government works. We deserve every last thing Trump does because of our arrogance, at home and abroad. We stopped questioning whether or not we should fight a war; if it was a just war, or if it was an excuse to promote a military industrial complex as well as expand economic might. We deserve to be subjugated because we *want* to be subjugated. We're not willing to stand up for ourselves, so now we get to be destroyed. There are no patriots.

"Listen to : Most people think of politics as its own unique public institution governed by impartial laws dating back to the founders. Not so. Politics is, in fact, an industry—most of whose key players are private, gain-seeking organizations. The industry competes, just like other industries, to grow and accumulate resources and influence for itself. The key players work to advance their self-interests, not necessarily the public interest. It’s important to recognize that much of what constitutes today’s political system has no basis in the Constitution. As our system evolved, the parties—and a larger political industrial complex that surrounds them—established and optimized a set of rules and practices that enhanced their power and diminished our democracy. These changes—often created behind closed doors and largely invisible to the average citizen—continue to take their toll at both the federal and the state levels. The politics industry is different from virtually all other industries in the economy because the participants, themselves, control the rules of competition. There is no truly independent regulation of politics that protects the public interest. Free from regulation and oversight, the duopoly does exactly what one would fear: The rivals distort the rules of competition in their favor. Examples of this includes controlling access to the general election ballot, partisan gerrymandering, and the Hastert Rule, which puts partisan concerns above legislating for the public interest.",t3_aavm07,progressive

You want to get the pro-Trump news? You go to Fox.” I don't agree. I think having a diverse media is a good thing. It allows people to get information from points of view they otherwise wouldn't. What I think is a tragedy is that so much of the information the right wing news sources put out is misleading and/or outright false. Many are blatantly dishonest and of the rest only the Wall Street Journal maintains journalistic ethics. This statement by Dershowitz, for example. CNBC and CNN are NOT anti-Trump. They are mainstream news sources and make an effort to be nonpartisan. Unlike Fox News, which claims to be fair and balanced, these media do try to portray 'both sides' even when doing so leaves viewers less informed than they otherwise would be.

Leaders or politicians are representations of the 'mood', chosen to express the voice of the majority.** Shifts in the national mentality are initiated when discontent with present conditions over time drives Americans to pursue a new trend that promises to satisfy the interest of the masses.

Even if we take the current contradictory number hovering at around 65% satisfaction among Americans with their current healthcare, a large portion of those people must be dissatisfied with other people's coverage. After all, we have to listen in the news, when it is reported, over and over about people who died or had to go to the emergency room for preventable conditions due to not having healthcare or not having sufficient healthcare. Furthermore, 70% of people under 40 are in favor of Medicare For All, so the number is only going to continue to grow. Medicare for All has already been sold to the American people, including Republicans.

"Think back to President Obama’s famous promise that 'If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.

Some form of health insurance covers about 85% of Americans and 70% of those people with insurance are happy with their coverage. That’s a lot of people that need to be convinced that Medicare for All won’t change what they currently have. It’s a key hurdle that the article doesn’t mention. Complicating matters is that many of those happy people are union members who are an important part of the Democrat party base. Many of them have the Cadillac health plans that economists think drive up the cost of health care for everyone. Getting those people to switch to Medicare For All, or even a hybrid system, is going to be a tough sell.

Low taxes and less regulation allow people to prosper. Public assistance harms the poor. Government, in short, is the enemy of liberty. This is being taught to children. >“Charles Koch had a hands-on role in the design of the high school curriculum,” the reporter reveals, based on leaked emails from a Google group left open to the public. “The goal … was to turn young people into ‘liberty-advancing agents’ before they went to college, where they might learn ‘harmful’ liberal ideas.” To combat (alleged) brainwashing you must... brainwash.

The low-wage jobs they do create aren’t of great quality. And it’s not entirely clear if their offerings are that much more affordable either. When economists compared the price of goods like flour and raisins of the same weight, they noticed that dollar store products were higher cost than those at the nearby Walmart or Costco. >Then there’s their negative effect on others stores nearby. When a dollar store opened up in Haven, Kansas—subsidized through tax breaks by the local government—sales at the the nearby Foodliner grocery store dropped by 30 percent, The Guardian reported earlier this year. While the ILSR doesn’t have quantitative data supporting this effect on supermarkets in the vicinity, anecdotally, they surmise that “the difference in margins is just enough that the local stores are not able to stay in business when there are so few options and there is an undercutting of prices,” Donahue said.",t3_a8wnnb,progressive

"Article excerpt: Two new reports on Russian political interference released by the Senate this past week — one from ' Although he wasn’t speaking directly about civil rights, it’s impossible to ignore how well the issue fits. In the closing sections of the “Long Telegram,” Kennan wrote: Much depends on health and vigor of our own society…. Every courageous and incisive measure to solve internal problems of our own society, to improve self-confidence, discipline, morale and community spirit of our own people, is a diplomatic victory over Moscow worth a thousand diplomatic notes and joint communiqués…. We must formulate and put forward for other nations a much more positive and constructive picture of sort of world we would like to see than we have put forward in past. Similarly, Kennan's Foreign Affairs essay concluded: The issue of Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this. In the light of these circumstances, the thoughtful observer of Russian-American relations will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlin's challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which, by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear [...] What all these examples serve underscore is something that should be obvious but perhaps needs to be said: The best way to defend America is not with hardware or software or technical fixes, but by America realizing its highest ideals. Fighting to overcome racism strengthens every facet of American life. A vibrant, inclusive democracy is its own best defense.",t3_a94vdv,progressive

When I ask my significant other how their day went and they say they feel 'whipped' I am not seeing slaves working on a plantation in rural Alabama pre-American civial war or a shrimper somewhere in south east Asia  in some sort of circular shape. It doesn't mean that was the only use for the phrase before it, and at least (in a very much U.S. perspective) it was one of the last major uses of traditional horse drawn wagons. It has been used since both literally in wars and figuratively as in this case since. Yes it sucks what western expansion had done to various native groups between the Atlantic and Pacific and throughout the world as a whole. I'm sure there of people out there that do have negative feelings associated with this phrase directly from the type of scene they an I conjure it doesn't mean its the only meaning of it and should just be one to avoid to use in any context. There are words and phrases that really have no place in a modern use of our language despite the context. It may be rude and hurtful for to use the phrase if it was said in say an article about Keystone or other issue directly or only impacting native populations throughout the US. It doesn't look like that is the case here. Being hyper-vigilant to police language can be dangerous just as much as using potentially hurtful words and phrases carelessly.

[...] The simple truth is this: There's no good way to set up a debate schedule when there are this many likely candidates running. But by glossing over the specifics on how candidates will qualify for the debates, the DNC is setting itself up for a world of pain next summer. I think that DNC Chair Tom Perez should be lauded for his efforts to make the primary process more inclusive of grassroots voices, and that providing fair and objective qualification criteria---as soon as it becomes practical to do so---will be a huge win for restoring faith in the party's primary process.",t3_a8kzu0,progressive

"Dershowitz is being blacklisted because his idea of being a civil libertarian is full of shit and he has apparently gotten old and batty.

This is the old 'let's debate climate change, Ted Cruz against a team of scientists that are standing on the shoulders of centuries of scientists' argument, after all, both 'opinions' have equal merit right? Facts and trade expertise have no place in debate except for the ability to earn points with the viewing audience. Dershowitz is actually suggesting we should weigh Mueller's investigation against whatever bullshit Giuliani spouts to fire-up the base, and I guess, take a poll. This is retarded stuff for someone formerly of Dershowitz caliber, and I can only imagine the reason he says it is to get gigs on Fox News, then he expects gigs on real news outlets to defend his position too.

There is no realistic expectation that they will do so since the only reason they aren't running as Republicans is a guaranteed primary win where the DNC just doesn't care about the state. Of course you can negotiate that, but that's going to require giving power inside the Democratic party to Republicans who ran as Democrats which again, neuters your ability to get an agenda passed into law, defeat horrible lifetime appointments, or change anything about the system which has been subverted and corrupted by Republicans.

Due to the basic inability to build nuclear and its inability to compete economically with renewables and storage, the only possible future for nuclear is publically owned nuclear, and that's the direction I've seen most nuclear advocates take lately. However, it would be a better investment of public funds to just buy the renewables and storage, or to provide zero-carbon credits, or basically do anything other than nuclear. It's dead technology until it has major technological revolution to reduce costs. ",t3_aam39b,progressive
