"I'd like to point out that the fact that an excuse is old and recycled doesn't make it any less legitimate. Certainly, most acts of terror have been committed in the name of Islam, but I find it unreasonable to blame the religion itself or its followers given the fact that only a very, very small minority of muslims are terrorists. If I dare speak from my experience, I assure you that 'violence against anyone who's different, be it Christian or Jew' is in no way fundamental to Islam. Our kids learn in primary school to accept other religions, to coexist with them. They learn about how Christianity and Judaism came to be. They learn about their prophets, their holy books. In no way whatsoever do our teachings even imply the notion of violence or hatred towards them. Now, I'm not going to go into full denial either. Terrorist acts are indeed committed mostly in the name of Islam, but if I were to explain why extremists go about committing atrocities in the name of religion, I would point out the fact that most of them are either uneducated and only have a vague idea that their Muslim ancestors used to fight Non-believers because that was obviously the thing to do, or they have been brainwashed to think that the path to heaven was soaked in the blood of christians. Please note that I am not justifying their acts of violence, nor am I denying the fact that terrorism is indeed related to Islam. I am merely stating the way most of us Muslims see the issue. It's like having a distant relative who's gone bad and become a serial killer, and then the whole family gets branded as killers. Also, It wasn't my intention to insult anyone's intelligence or to deny the facts. I apologize if that is how it sounded. ",t3_a81y1q,worldevents

Once there's sufficient atmosphere, it'll do a pull up maneuver to settle into a long horizontal glide. This is a 1960s technology that was researched by both the US and USSR in connection with developing ICBMs. The USSR also used a variation on the technique in some of their lunar probe missions.

"From the article: ' With cunning and pragmatism, Deng [Xiaoping] and his aides dismantled a broken economy and dystopian society left behind by Mao Zedong. They re-awoke the country’s slumbering genius for capitalism and found a way to call it socialism, albeit “with Chinese characteristics”. By 2004 the economy was 44 times larger than it was on December 18th 1978 (as measured in current Chinese yuan, the method used in Chinese official commemorarations of the anniversary. When measured in constant 2010 American dollars, the economy in 2004 was 11 times larger, as can be seen in chart 1). It was on that date that party leaders began a meeting that is now officially called the start of the era of gaige kaifang. Though growth has been slowing of late, the trend has been impressive. As China prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of the opening of the conclave, the country’s GDP in current yuan is more than five times larger than it was in 2004 (in constant 2010 American dollars China’s economy is more than three times larger than in 2004). ' ... ' ... in Maoist times those accused of capitalist tendencies lost property and even their lives. Today, billionaires can be party members, and—if they toe the line—feted as patriots. ... ' ... ' Deng ... was no liberal. He had faith in technocrats and was willing to delegate authority to them. He saw the power of material incentives to drive efficiencies and progress. But he saw a role for a scientific, modern state too, in common with the leaders of such Asian tigers as South Korea or Singapore. ' Most important, Deng bequeathed China a lopsided version of reform, in which economic freedoms were not matched by political opening. That explains problems today, says Mao Yushi, a free-market economist and outspoken critic of Mao Zedong’s poisonous influence on Chinese society. He speaks with some authority, having been purged in the 1950s as a “rightist” and whipped during the Cultural Revolution. Mr Mao, who is the honorary chairman of the Unirule think-tank, recalls the 1980s as “the most democratic time in Chinese politics”, until progress was “stopped by the shots fired on June 4th [1989]”. Deng, he says, “contributed greatly to the marketisation of the Chinese economy, but he interrupted the political advancement of China. That was his big mistake.” Today Mr Mao sees China’s development being threatened by a tightening of curbs on free speech which he says is stifling badly needed debate about policy. Many economists, including those within the government, privately agree. But at the age of 89, he is unusually able to speak without fear. ' In this moment of doubt and dissent, many Chinese liberals put their faith in a surprising champion: President Donald Trump. They hope that pressure from Mr Trump will force Mr Xi to keep promises made in recent speeches—to open markets further to foreign investors, better protect intellectual property and encourage fair competition. By way of precedent, such optimists cite beneficial foreign pressure on China when it entered the WTO. Not all are so confident. “People want political change. I think getting political change through a trade war is hard,” says Mr Mao, drily. China’s liberals do not exactly admire Mr Trump. It is more that they hope he will prove a bigger bully than Mr Xi. On this somewhat gloomy anniversary, reformers will take what help they can get. '***Correction (December 7th 2018):*** An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that President Xi Jinping, in a speech on November 23rd to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the birth of Liu Shaoqi, a former head of state deposed by Chairman Mao Zedong, failed to refer to Liu’s purging or Maoist excesses. In fact in his speech Mr Xi did note that Liu was killed as the result of wrongs committed by Mao’s acolytes, Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. We apologise for this mistake. '***Clarification (December 9th 2018):*** This piece previously only measured the growth in China’s economy between 1978 and today in current Chinese yuan. We have added the conversion in constant 2010 American dollars, which is the rate we used in chart 1. '",t3_a6874q,worldevents

"I think it's important to compare military spending in respect to GDP to rivals rather than allies. It's important because allies will try to avoid duplicative military spending. Therefore, if the US spends enough to ensure safety beyond the level that, say France, desires, then France is not going to increase their spending. They are actually likely to decrease it to focus on other aspects of their society, since they would not feel that security is worth spending money on if the US already has it covered. Now it gets interesting when Trump starts to say that Europe should fend for themselves because it gets Europeans thinking that their security is not ensured by the US, and therefore they need to spend more of their GDP to secure their region. It'll be interesting to see how European countries decide to pay for the increased military budgets. On the other hand, comparing the US to France would say that the US should reduce their spending by GDP to meet France, but it's more important that the US compare their spending to Russia and China. Russia is interesting because it is high by GDP, but the Russian economy is small. The Chinese spending by GDP is small, but their economy is so big, that the Chinese military spending is more than all of Western European military spending combined. What gets even harder to think about is where the Chinese military spending was 10 years ago. If it increases at the same rate, it is likely to overtake the US military spending in about 20 years. And then overtake the rest of the world combined in 30 years.",t3_a8e3rw,worldevents

It only re-enforces that 'you versus us' narrative, especially given how reprehensibly the Israeli state has acted towards the Palestinian people. I'm not foolish enough to believe that Israel can be dismantled as a nation at this point. But the only way to maintain it solely as a homeland for the Jewish people is with a boot on the neck of the Palestinian people. In my book that makes Israel dangerously close to being the monster it fears.",t3_a4cz48,worldevents

His fact evaluation follows the pattern of national interest not of personal moral values. It was a choice of the electoral process. The investigation cd prove that he was in phone contact with an alleged participant of a supposed murder. No one hinders the further investigating. But why should we blind to the fact that there are powerful enemies of the liberal prince - those who are upset by his pragmatism on liberating women ( to let them drive) and on the relation to Israel. Is it not a minimal honesty to try to mention that it is an 50% possibility that the prince was not directly a supporter or initiator of the tragic event. To pretend his actual invilvement is 100% sure and proven is a wishful self deceptive lie. And the level of cruelty in extremist families ( who were allegedly protected by the victim) is astounding: fathers and brothers have sacred rights to murder sisters and wifes if they suspect them with immoral feelings.

"The problem is one of Israel's own making, and is very similar to how the vilification of socialism by the American right has led to more young people identifying as socialists. The ruling party in Israel has intentionally worked to make support of Israel synonymous with support of their right-wing nationalist agenda, including the violent suppression of the Palestinians and the illegal expansion of settlements. Anyone who disagrees with these agendas is labeled as anti-Israel and, by extension, anti-semitic. But it does not have to be that way. I consider myself anti-Zionist, but not anti-Israel. I just think trying to establish a solely Jewish ethno-state is a bad idea. Just as bad as those idiotic attempts to found a white ethno-state within the US.

">In **no case** is someone who adopts principled reasons for opposition 'lying with dogs'. 'No case' is the operative phrase that I find fault with. It depends on who they make common cause with and who they refuse to make common cause with. You can agree with someone on one issue, yet find them so reprehensible on other issues that you refuse to give them a soapbox in your meeting. And, you can distance yourself from them in general. Change that 'In **no case**' to 'Not necessarily' and you would be right. >They have no say in what ethically bankrupt reasons others may adopt for opposing Israel, and are impotent to stop them ... That isn't the case at all. They do have a say in determining who they will publicly align themselves with and who they will distance themselves from. And they have the power to prevent them from participating in their fund-raising and letters-to-the-editors and joint advertising campaigns and similar political activities. 'He that lies with the dogs, riseth with fleas.' is a platitude, but there is often much truth in platitudes. This one is the same as 'you are known by the company you keep'. And there is truth in that platitude also, even though there is no complete agreement. Maybe that is unfair treatment of an individual ethical objector, but that is human nature. You can be opposed to certain policies of the Israeli government. But when you take the stage with groups or individuals that call for elimination of the 'Zionist entity' that gives pause to some to wonder about what 'side' someone is aligning themselves with and why they are doing so. Feminist leaders that call for 'Zionist women' to be excluded from marches, and then take the stage with someone like Louis Farakhan are an example. you suggest guilt by association I was saying that guilt by association is not a way to look at it as a knee-jerk reflex and that there are principled people that may be anti-Zionist or anti-Israel and not anti-Semites. However, there is something to having 'guilt by association' come into play in the thought process that analyzes opposition or support of anything.

"The definition of Zionism is the support and development of a Jewish nation in Israel. This means that Zionism does not only come in the form of the right wing of Israeli politics but pretty much any Jewish party in Israel supports this idea. Zionism is an ethnic movement and for a good reason. Just over 70 years ago 6 million Jews were ethnically cleansed, and before that there were pogroms, crusades, slavery and exile. I am an atheist who is culturally Jewish. I would be quite happy to live my life not caring at all for what ethnicity or religion people belong to. However, most people of the world care significantly about others’ ethnicity, and in my case enough to kill me for no other reason. Therefore I and my people cannot afford to back off from the idea of a Jewish state. Good luck convincing us otherwise. We are willing to negotiate many things but we will never compromise on that. I agree that you can be anti current Israel policies or regime without being antisemitic, but you cannot be anti Zionist without being anti semitic. Being anti Zionist is basically demanding all the Jews in Israel to put themselves at grave risk of death, or at least a perceived risk of death. Nobody asks the Polish nation to cease being Polish.

">IN HIS FIRST term in the Moneda palace between 2010 and 2014, Sebastián Piñera, a billionaire businessman of the centre-right, oversaw rapid economic growth but failed to inspire popular affection. After an interlude in which Chile swung left under Michelle Bachelet, Mr Piñera has been back as president since March. Second terms often disappoint—Ms Bachelet’s did—but Mr Piñera says he has learned from experience. “There’s no better school for being a good president than La Moneda,” he says. “The second time you know better what you have to do and how to do it.” >What he has to do, he says, is to restore economic growth, improve the quality of Chile’s democracy and promote equality of opportunity “so that nobody is left out”. This agenda is similar to that of the Concertación, the centre-left alliance that ruled Chile for 20 years after General Pinochet’s dictatorship, the last four of them under Ms Bachelet in her first term, from 2006 to 2010. >In her second term, between 2014 and 2018, she junked the Concertación, allied with the Communist Party and declared that reducing inequality was her priority. She pushed through reforms, many poorly designed, of education, tax, the electoral system and labour relations. Businesses took fright; partly as a result, economic growth averaged just 1.7% in 2013-17, compared with 5% in Mr Piñera’s first term. >The president has taken advantage of the opposition’s leftward tilt to seize the centre ground. Voters seem to support the “Chilean model” of market democracy that his programme embodies. In a recent poll almost 70% said they were much better off than their parents, but 52% said they favoured more equality. >Rather than “what to do”, the trickier thing for Mr Piñera will be “how to do it”. He must govern with a congress in which he lacks a majority and in which the far-left Broad Front has a significant presence for the first time. Money will be fairly tight. Government debt, while still low at 24% of GDP, has doubled in each of the past two governments. Felipe Larraín, the finance minister, says that his aim is to “stabilise” the country’s debt and cut its fiscal deficit from 2.8% of GDP in 2017 to 1.6% next year. >The government is proposing a tax reform that partially undoes Ms Bachelet’s by making investment tax-deductible. It is relying mainly on faster growth to make up any shortfall in revenues and to finance an ambitious pension reform which will add a more generous top-up of public money to a pioneering but widely disliked private-pension system. >Mr Larraín says he expects the tax reform to be approved by mid-2019. Pension reform will be harder. Much depends on the government’s skill in negotiating with moderates in the opposition. In his first term Mr Piñera struck many Chileans as arrogant. Now he seems more astute and decisive. “The general approach is good but the devil will be in the detail,” says a former Concertación minister. “Part of the right is still inclined to listen only to business. He has to convince the opposition that he sees beyond special interests.” >Two things could yet derail Mr Piñera. The first is that he risks having raised expectations that he cannot meet. Economic growth has picked up this year. Investment is up by 6%, says the president. But the context is less favourable than in his first term. “They say that Bachelet used the world economy as an excuse, and now they are using it,” says Heraldo Muñoz, who leads the opposition Party for Democracy. >The second trap is social conflicts, such as those with students which bedevilled his first term. Last month police tried to cover up their murder of a member of the Mapuche, an indigenous people. That followed a string of scandals—ranging from planting evidence to corruption—in the Carabineros, the once-revered police force. The army is no better. Some officers have been found to have stolen public money; others have sold arms to drug-traffickers. “They have had too much autonomy,” Mr Piñera concedes. He may be better placed than his opponents to turn these scandals, which are a legacy of the dictatorship, into an opportunity for reform. He has sent a bill to modernise the police to congress, and plans another for the army. >With the opposition fragmented, and populists to his left and right, many Chileans wish Mr Piñera well. If his government is successful, he may usher in a long period of dominance by the centre-right. If so, it will be because he has stolen the Concertación’s clothes. *** Over there, on the sidebar ----------' (**Handy Helpful Hint**: you can often get around the paywall by Googling the title, or by clearing your cookies and browser cache.)

" >Netanyahu also said that it is now possible to fly over Egypt and Chad, a country with whom Israel still does not have formal diplomatic relations but  “The combination of our intelligence and technological capabilities gives us a map of relations that is getting bigger,” he said Netanyahu said that the most important flight route Israel has is the direct flight to San Francisco. “It doesn't matter how many flight are added, there are not enough,” he said of this route to Silicon Valley. “These are not tourists, these are investors.” >The second most important route, he said, was to Beijing and other cities in China. “This is the biggest market that has opened, and it is important to get a free trade agreement.” >And the third most important route, he said, is to India, noting that Air India flies to and from New Delhi everyday directly over Saudi Arabia. >“Soon we will fly to Mumbai,” he said, referring to direct flight over Saudi Arabia and Oman to Mumbai, since El Al currently flies there via a more circuitous route. “Tel Aviv -Mumbai is a shorter flight than Tel Aviv-London,” he added.",t3_a4vtlz,worldevents
"I understand the historical context but if the French don't want the US president making comments about their politics, why is their president making comments about ours? Why doesn't Macron worry about his own country falling apart before trying to lecture America about how bad nationalism is?",t3_a4ppsj,worldevents

I can't help but think not all Germans during the war were Nazis. So why would you think all Americans are backing what the US has been doing?,t3_a99ez5,worldevents
"From the article -- ' These days the world’s most popular recreational drugs are increasingly made from synthetic ingredients, not plants. The fringes of China’s vast pharmaceutical and chemical industries have proved to be good places to produce them. The country is the world’s biggest exporter of pharmaceutical ingredients and accounts for one-third of global sales of chemicals. Weak regulation has enabled the diversion of legally produced drugs into underground markets.... ' For years the biggest such business was making stimulants such as amphetamines and methamphetamines, which are also produced in neighbouring countries (see article). Such drugs have been growing increasingly popular among China’s drug-takers and in the rich world. But the synthetic opioid crisis in America has created new business opportunities. America says most illicit fentanyl comes from labs in China. Finished opioids or the ingredients needed to produce them are sold by Chinese distributors to gangs in Mexico and Canada, who smuggle them into America. They can also be bought online and shipped directly to American buyers using international mail services. ' Fentanyl’s unusual potency—30 times greater than heroin—makes it easy to smuggle powerful amounts in small, hard-to-detect quantities. It can be disguised, for example, as the tiny sachets of desiccant used to stop many packaged goods from going soggy. In 2017 America’s Department of Justice guessed that fentanyl purchased in China for $3,000-5,000 could be worth around $1.5m on American streets. About 29,000 people in America died from overdosing on opioids such as fentanyl in 2017, up from about 5,000 in 2014. '",t3_aag6fu,worldevents

"What solution is there to this problem? Encourage reason, they kill you. It seems like they're not happy until either all of them are dead or they've achieved their goals. This essentially leaves those who are against them one option.",t3_a1vb1u,worldevents
"If he could critizise someone like an adult, and not with crappy nicknames on twitter, yea, I would respect Trump more. I mean, I don't have a lot of respect for a man who has lied to my face for 2 years about the Stormy Daniels payments, but it would be something. Just once, ONCE, I want this president to not care about a percieved insult or slight. This President is a walking-talking napooleon complex. Napoleon was at least an effective leader tho.",t3_a4ppsj,worldevents
