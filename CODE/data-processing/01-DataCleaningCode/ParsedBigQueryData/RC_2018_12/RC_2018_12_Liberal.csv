" Well you see, capitalism is the most effective and fairest economic system in human history. You put in hard work, you get lots of money. You put in not-so-good work, you don’t get that much money. So it creates a motivation for hard workers to provide a service to the consumer, which means there is innovation and production going on in your country. The same with modern Democracy, it has allowed for equality in America. What other combination of systems has been more effective than the one we use today?",t3_a3ckon,Liberal

Of course, you can point at a group of, say, misandristic feminists and say, 'there you go, feminists are sexist' but they don't represent the entire group. That's why I'm not a big fan of giving people labels like 'conservative', 'liberal', 'republican', 'democrat' etc. because it: 1. makes it harder for people to change their minds because it kinda becomes a part of them, causing tribalism (we see this in many political subs from both sides but we just have to look at subs like r/the_donald for example) 2. it's impossible to criticise the entire group because you'll get a 'not all' response, making it very hard to criticise a movement or ideology and therefore sometimes an echo chamber is 'formed'. For example, I could criticise feminism by saying that it supports the ideas of Islam, giving some women's marches as proof and then explaining the problems with that but that would obviously be inaccurate because I'm sure there are a lot of feminist groups fighting for rights opposing the misogynistic ideals of Islam. Which is why I prefer to say 'i support and fight for the equality of the sexes' rather than calling myself a feminist because being a 'feminist' is pretty vague and has a big stigma. Of course, feminism is 'the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes' but one could argue that, for example - the DPRK isn't democratic, and that similarly, 'feminists' might not be supportive of the equality of the sexes (which of course, is true for a select few). Look - there are nearly 350 million people in the US and nearly 8 billion people in the world - every single person thinks differently. There's no need to limit people and give labels like 'conservative' and 'liberal' and then criticise an entire group (republican in this case) when it's not even true that all are like that.",t3_aagjl3,Liberal

The closest I found was, 'Guns kept in the home are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal unintentional shooting, criminal assault or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.' This references injuring or killing an attacker, which is not the same as 'defending' as you stated. This would not include times where just the possession or unveiling of a firearm is sufficient to deter the attacker.

"Dude an AR15 is not a weapon of war. No soldier in their right mind would carry an AR15 on to any battlefield on earth - or they’ll quite simply get out gunned. An AR15 is a hunting rifle - plain and simple. My personal hunting rifle is an AR15 chambered in 6.5 Creedmore. I hunt deer, hogs, coyotes, rabbits, bear, wolves, and literally any other animal you can think of. The reason we get pissed off when we hear the whole “ban AR15 now reeee” is because we know what it’ll lead to. AR15s will get banned. So we’ll start using AK47s, SKS, FNAR, M1A, Scars, and the list just keeps going. Then they’ll ban semi auto rifles in general - and now we’re stuck hunting with bolt action rifles. And good fucking luck hunting a boar, wolves, bear, and many other animals that may in fact charge you and fucking kill you if your shot doesn’t hit. Or if you miss your first shot and they just fucking bolt - semi auto gives you the opportunity to send more rounds down range to hit your target. All the while bad people will STILL be murdering people with AR15s. You people lack all logic. And when you talk about common sense laws? Fucking ridiculous. That’s like allowing a plumber to make restrictions and rules for pilots. But sure. Keep stripping rights from your fellow law abiding citizens - all because you’re afraid of “the black rifle”. Ban guns, and people will still kill people with guns. Ban AR’s and people will STILL kill people with ARs.

"In all fairness, depends on the way it was packaged. We have a president being connected to the NORAD santa tracking system. You don't call unless you are prepared for some precise ass information. 'At 7, that's marginal.' Think of it this way. He is telling a young child to think for himself. Do you believe in santa clause is the first clue. Belief , coming from an adult, being 'optional', reveals that the adult does not know. Now, the president could go with the joke, and make christmas hell for the parents. Yes, I am the president of the US, of course I have santas number. Yes, they briefed me and introduced me, nice man. Yes, He gave me this list and it said you were extra good, I usually have specialists on that, but could you do me the honor on explaining what that meant? can you give me any intell what that was about? Feeding the kids ego, untill his parents are left with a klid that believes due to some calculation error he is going to get a gold plated playstation. Because why would the president lie to him? Or, he can do the uncomfortable thing. He can plant the first seeds of doubt, and take the blame. Because he is the president of the united states, and he can deliver tough messages. Because Santa not being real.... That's a given. Now, you can package this in one of two ways: One, you can drop it like a hot potato, yes, santa is a lie, we lied to you, christmas is ruined, yes, this year no gifts, but if you cry a bit about your ruined christmas to the nice reporters, they will buy you shit to make up for it. Or, you could go down on one knee, and go, 'Son, there are two possibilities here. One is, a fat old man flies a sleigh in one night all around the world, stopping at every home in the world, dropping presents like bombs, and somehow, norad tracks him. Oh, yea, and the NSA has actually invested in elf on a shelf. Or, you could think about a father and a mother, who love their little kid so very much, that they want to make him smile like they did. So, since they still have no clue how to be parents, they searched their memories of how christmas was for them, and found what they had liked best, and tried to create it for the little boy. They believe the little boy is still so little that he has to believe the gifts come from the northpole, without going through customs and taxes, when instead his dad took the little money he put aside for himself, and spend a bit less on himself, and his mom took the money she usually spend on herself, and they tried really hard to do a good job at making the kid happy. Even if that meant that they had to fib a bit about santa. Now, I do not know what you will do, but if I make a suggestion, look at your mom. Look at your dad. Both of them love you so very much that they took the money they could have spend on what they liked, and invested it in making you the best christmas possible. And that takes some effort, from the cookies to the music. What I would do is to think that all the media has told people about me, is that I tell a lot of lies, so say that I lied to your parents. I made a joke about santa not being real, but you wanted to not believe me. This way, if santa is or isn't real, is between you and me. Because sometimes, it is more important for the parents that the children believe in santa clause, even when the children allready had their doubts. So, if you want, believe in santa clause, if you don't, also good. But do me a personal favor, and let them down gently. Because they tried so hard to make everything allright for you, it could be beneficial to play along for a few more years, just untill they aren't that nervous anymore. '",t3_a9fbkb,Liberal

"Actually, the practice of gift giving is roman pantheistic in origin. Saturnalia was a Holiday where it was customary to get drunk, have a huge gay orgy, and give gifts to each other after a merry buttfucking. Actually, about the date, roman emperor aurelian declared the 25.th of december to be the birthday of sol invictus, and Pope julius the first correctly assumed that if they had a chill, small family friendly celebration, over time, the buttfucking and the getting drunk would die out, and only christioanity would remain, with the people stuill wanting a festival at that time of the year. But, the festival remained, and with it many strange and weird customs, that all had a very heathen background. This is also why during the protestant reformation, people suddenly were intent on banning christmas all together, untill pretty much charles dickens ressurected the custom, and brought back christmas, but now in a PG version, with all the drunken gay sex cut out. So yea, pretty much, if you want to claim Christmas is christian, please, don't have a war on the meaning of christmas, crossdress, have a massive orgy with the kids present, and give them small gifts afterwards.

Honestly capitalism is something that should be questioned, but it is certainly the least questionable of economic systems due to its historical successes. I didn’t just hear it from some conservative dudes, you don’t even need that to understand how successful capitalism is. Take a look at the place you live in, you have house (or apartment), you have electricity, you have a computer and probably a mobile phone of some sort, you likely have a bunch of clothes to wear, you have running water, and a selection at the grocery store that is more diverse **AND** healthier than let’s say the selection of food for a European king in the 1700’s. With a genuine review of capitalism, I’d rate it a 10/10. Also eat a can of baked beans in a movie theater until some black teenager yells “THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS” then spill the beans all over yourself and awkwardly shuffle out of your seat only to trip on literally nothing and next thing you know you’re covered in beans. The whole theatre laughs at you, the guy in the filming room even pauses the movie and laughs too. All you can do is leave the movie theatre at this point. So you go to leave and then slip on the ramp to the exit of the theatre room and land inside of the trash can that’s right there.

We currently have historically low tax rates for the wealthy and some states can’t even fund their schools or fix their bridges. Wealthy people are not paying into the system that made them wealthy. Essentially making it impossible for everyone else to get the same opportunities that made them wealthy. Sacrifice seems to be something for the poor while the wealthy can get away with anything in America. This is the country where affluenza is taken seriously by a judge.

However, in my opinion the problem arises when children DIE in the process, showing that these attempts are violent and forceful. Not to mention presenting that as a POSITIVE thing that two children died. I believe in reducing illegal immigration without harming people outside our country's borders. I'm still figuring out what would need to happen for that to happen - I'm open to new ideas. I think the 'conservative' approach (e.g. building a wall) hurts people outside borders while the 'liberal' approach (letting in illegal immigrants) hurts its citizens as it costs taxpayers a lot.

Millions of undocumented immigrants file tax returns each year, and they are paying taxes for benefits they can’t even use. >The best estimates come from research by the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, DC, think tank, which suggests that about half of undocumented workers in the United States file income tax returns. The most recent IRS data, from 2015, shows that **the agency received 4.4 million income tax returns from workers who don’t have Social Security numbers, which includes a large number of undocumented immigrants.** ***That year, they paid $23.6 billion in income taxes***\*\*.\*\* Not a proponent of illegal immigration, but if you're going to talk shit, at least make sure the shit you talk is true... otherwise, you just look like a dumbfuck &#x200B; &#x200B;",t3_a5hcaj,Liberal

"Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed (Cook and Ludwig, 1996; Kleck, 2001a). Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). On the other hand, some scholars point to a radically lower estimate of only 108,000 annual defensive uses based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (Cook et al., 1997). From:  I'll take that ALL day over an anti-gun list of news articles, designed to try and bully people into giving up their rights (it lets you filter incidents to specific representatives of a district, as if they're the ones running around shooting people). A list that literally includes shootings with BB guns, but only counts defensive uses where the victim actually shot a bullet. See, that's a clever trick really. It gets people to bicker about whether that 'counts', meanwhile several people will stop a violent attack in its tracks as their assailant runs away at the sight of a gun.",t3_a9q3nd,Liberal

"Don't move the goal posts now. You had a chance to give a serious answer and you went with the most childish response imaginable. Now that I've proved your initial answer wrong, you don't get to change it. Oh, and the people who are victims of war always deserve sympathy, because war is horrible and always results in innocent people suffering, but the invasion of Afghanistan was completely justified by any reasonable measure. The Taliban harbored Al qaeda, and Al Qaeda attached us. They murdered 3000 people, specifically targeting civilians. The Taliban protected them. I have sympathy for innocent people who suffered from the invasion, but the tal8ban was a state sponsor of terrorism and deserved to be overthrown. And for Iraq, if you ask the Kurds they'll speak well of the us and the invasion generally. So there's that. As for Central and South America, we were combating what were often Soviet backed insurgents. Stopping the Soviet Union spreading was a worthwhile goal. It was a series of proxy wars between the us and USSR. It's an understatement to say they were unfortunate, but it's an overstatement to say it was unjustified.

"Theres some thought that muellers report on Manafort and how he broke his plea agreement works as a way for Mueller to ensure that he can release at least some of the information related to trump and Russia that might be buried in his report if Whitaker or any other attorney general doesn't allow it to be made public or sent on to congress. Marcy Wheeler has done a very good job covering the Mueller investigation and was the first to suggest this. Let's hope.she is correct. Trump is finally in a tough spot. If he fires Mueller now he will surely be impeached by the house quickly after the dems take over. If he is impeached he cannot pardon anyone related to the impeachment. That means don jr., Manafort, stone, Kushner, Ivanka. Not only that pence cant pardon him either. He may be able to pardon people after the impeachment if he is not convicted. But the impeachment itself would draw out a ton of evidence to the public's attention that they aren't aware of yet. And the impeachment trial could last a long time. But really his best option to harm the investigation is to remove the FBI's involvement and ability to investigate further. But doing so would leave him in such a terrible position because he couldn't pardon anyone and he couldn't be pardoned himself if he resigned. So it looks like Mueller has an opportunity to release good information on trump that trump's lackeys cant hide from the public or Congress. Let's hope that's what he does. But I'd imagine if trump were going to fire Mueller his best opportunity to make it meaningful would be this week before Mueller files information with the court on his sentencing. After that we can expect trump to try and fire him if impeachment starts quickly in the new Congressional session. He would of course offer the worst excuses why he would do so, like 'they're already impeaching me what do we need Mueller for anymore?' or something like that. Still perilous times until he is out of office or jailed.",t3_a30sze,Liberal

"When someone walks into my home with a firearm - what else am I supposed to do? Seriously? Do I just run and hide and pray to god that they don’t find my kids or other family members? Do I try to defend myself and my family with a knife or a bat? Do I hide in a closet to call 911 and have to wait for ten minutes before a good guy with a firearm to shows up - all whilst hoping they don’t find my family members? I refuse to be a victim. And restrictive gun laws will ONLY hurt law abiding citizens, while they bolster the aggressiveness of armed criminals. Just because you ban firearms - it’s not going to just stop criminals from getting them and using them against you. We outlawed drugs. We still suffer from a massive drug epidemic - that is the cause of most violence. We have outlawed drinking and driving. Yet people die daily from getting hit by drunk drivers. We’ve outlawed rape. And people still get raped. Do you not remember what prohibition did to the underground alcohol business? It was illegal - yet it was still readily available. And huge crime families were formed and very very well compensated for it. Do you not find it a little strange that even Parkland HS has decided the best route to defend themselves and their students is by arming teachers and other staff? It’s absolutely unfair that you have the right to make myself and my family victims - while criminals will carry on with business as usual, with firearms. It’s so hilarious when I hear politicians talk about gun restrictions or an outright ban - yet they are protected 24/7 with people with firearms. I don’t imagine being a hero. I’m absolutely sickened of the thought of taking someone’s life. And I pray to god that I never have to use deadly force to protect myself, my family, my friends, or even strangers. You people are absolutely unable to use very basic logic. And in the simplest terms - here is the outcome of gun bans. I’d have to turn over my firearms, or I’d lie and say that I don’t own any anymore. Then I get into a situation to where a gun toting criminal can literally do whatever he pleases with me or my family. You’ve single handedly forced me to give up my only means of protection. And if I did lie and killed the intruder with a firearm - I get charged with murder. The only thing that will change your mind is if you get confronted by a gun toting criminal.

"No, that list does not count defensive uses of guns only where the victim shot the bullet. If you had actually read the descriptions of the incidents, you would know that. Your source offers no definitive number, only saying that it could be in a range. I could take that estimate of 108,000 annual defensive uses and say that it is outweighed by the 300,000 violent crimes using firearms on the line above. It offers no numbers to dispute. Furthermore, here is a study that shows that using a gun for defense does not significantly decrease your likelihood of being injured if you are the victim of a crime and using a weapon other than a gun increases your likelihood of not being robbed than if you used a gun:  I get it, you really, really, REALLY like guns. You like them so much that you seek out articles online that will purposefully infuriate you and then bicker with people in the comments. There is no source that will convince you.

"While I didn't take it so far as to not vote for her, I did not like Hillary Clinton as a candidate. That god-awful fake smile and the fact that she oozes slime is why. She absolutely fucking disgusted me during the primary debates. I think this is fair. This is my working theory right now. Keep in mind I'm not a cis person so I'm going off what cis women say about themselves. I think that for most of her political life, Hilary Clinton was not allowed to show her true emotions. Politicians in general have to be cagey, but people who aren't white males have to be much more subdued. We all know how Obama would hold it in although he was a master at it in a way (perhaps by, some argue, being excessively naive about the opposition). Women very much aren't allowed to be angry. The debates were very unnerving to me because the discord in her affect reminded me of my abusive mother. But I think that she felt she couldn't show what she really felt about Trump. So she does the long practiced fake smile. I thought about this because I saw the same fake, sarcastic smile on Kamala Harris' face the other day. It was when she was speaking on the anti-lynching legislation and Hyde-Smith, who said she would take a front row seat at a lynching, was presiding. Now some people saw this as sweet irony but I think Harris' demeanor suggests she felt that Hyde-Smith was a disgrace to the Senate and shouldn't be there at all, and it was a personal blow to her to have to put forward this legislation and stay calm and say nothing while Hyde-Smith was presiding. So I worked through my discomfort on Harris' expression because I think it's logical. In the same sense, I think that's a good deal of why Clinton, especially in the debate, dealing with a man who is being actively bullying, following her around and leaning over her, has this bizarre affect. If she reacts, that's 'weakness' and proof that she, as a woman, doesn't have the stones to lead.",t3_a8l3hl,Liberal

However, I think the link on taxes is a bit misleading. While it says immigrants (as a whole) pay billions in taxes, it says that, in total, illegal immigrants pay 23.6 million dollars annually. Since there are 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the US, one illegal immigrant only pays roughly 2 dollars in taxes annually. I think that either way, forcibly deporting illegal immigrants that have not committed a crime (other than illegal immigrating) is not an option. So yes, maybe the conservative solution isn’t as good as the liberal solution - but my point is, the liberal solution causes problems too.

"Well, I’m not an economist by Ill try to detail the points. Before I begin, it’s worth noting that one of the key aspects of economics is the flow of money. Money changing hands ensures that the money in the system maintains its value. Less money in the system means the value of money goes up, but the distribution goes down. Meaning things are cheaper, but people have less money and thus can’t buy as much, meaning even more people get less money. Too much money in the system money looses its scarcity. People have more money, but the prices go up, meaning they can distribute it less, and worst of all that means that more people have less money. This is called Deflation and Inflation respectively. The argument for trickle down economics (or Reaganomics when I was growing up) is that by giving businesses and rich people tax breaks, they would thus have more money to enterprise and purchase. A rich person may take the extra money and build a new business, thus employing more people granting more money to distribute around the economy, and with so many new businesses granting places to spend the money, the newly employed with create a self sustaining cycle. New business creates new jobs in which pays more people in which they use to purchase goods and services from a new business. Thus making that business a profit and creating more jobs thus growing the economy. This is called supply side economics and it’s a popular idea among the right. The left criticizes this for a few reasons. First: building a new business does not guarantee a demand for that business. You can’t hijack demand by creating more supply, so these businesses might just become anchors onto our economy. Second: this assumes that people are going to go from their new jobs to the new business and not just purchase things from the businesses they’ve already become accustomed to, ignoring the fact that people are becoming creatures of habit. Third: while it sounds good in theory in practice it never works out that way. We’ve seen multiple times these tax cuts just result in the old businesses becoming bigger while still figuring out ways to cut jobs. The only time we see a wealth of new businesses is when new industries crop up (like the rise of the World Wide Web). Fourth: this defacto just puts more stress of paying taxes on the middle class. Thus meaning less people are able to pay their taxes, so less people stay in the middle class, which means a smaller middle class that has even more stress of the taxes of the nation. This negative feedback loop usually means that the taxes the nation can actually collect are less. Meaning the deficit goes up, as the nation still has to pay for government programs. So the aggregate of this is that the middle class shrinks, the economy goes down because of less distribution, the deficit rises, and we have dead weights on our economy.",t3_a0nlxy,Liberal

However, I have begun turning off the tv or radio when I hear about school shootings. The way that they are covered makes me sick. It feels more like some sort of gory entertainment designed to keep people glued to their televisions than anything else. Ads are still playing while children are dying. Capitalism at its finest. To top it all off, the constant focus on school shootings does lead more disaffected kids to think about doing it and do it. Sources below. -Recent sources:    -Proof we’ve been talking about this for while:  Other reasons why I shut off school shooting coverage: -I don’t want to know the shooter’s name, because that’s probably part of the motivation for him to carry out the heinous deed. I don’t want to let the shooters win even that little victory. It’s mostly just for me, but maybe if we referred to school shooters as “some pathetic fuckwad” or something like that instead of their names, it would make it less appealing to them. -The issue of gun control should not sit in the shadows until a school shooting happens. It should be something that is calmly and rationally pushed at all times. The idea that we have to increase the fear levels of stressed out, under-supported, highly hormonal, highly impressionable kiddos, in the middle of the fallout from a terrorist act, in order to push a political agenda, is ridiculous. -The gun control debates that surround school shootings actually cause gun manufacturer profits and stock prices to spike.

"This was a very good answer. I’ll do my best to offer my perspective as honestly and open-minded as possible. I’m not leftwing, but I don’t think stricter background checks would be a horrible idea. The only issue I have with it is that illegal citizens tend to bypass this obstacle and in doing so makes it a more arduous process for law-abiding citizens. For the automatic weapons and assault rifles, I find the names to be incredibly misleading. From my perspective, media outlets tend to cultivate this term rather than referring to it as a modern sporting rifle. The word “assault” is merely being used as a descriptor, but the gun itself can’t assault anything- not without someone operating it. I just feel this terminology creates an ignorance towards these particular guns, after all we don’t call a hunting knife an assault knife. As for the constitution being outdated per this situation, it’s my belief that the constitution was not written just for those times. You may believe that the founding fathers never could have anticipated this type of weaponry, but the constitution was written to stand the test of times as a response to human behavior.

"1. I like how spending that much in just a single defense spending bill, which you yourself criticized as wasteful, is apparently not as bad as a comparable amount spent over the course of a lifetime. That's not even talking about the vast amounts of the federal budget earmarked for discretionary spending, most of which ends up getting thrown at the military. 2. Should be noted that the research appealed to in the article relied on data from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. 3. That research also included the effects of the legal citizens descendant from illegal immigrants, which would describe members of Trump's own family. 4. They didn't take into consideration anything that might have been added to the economy (for example, working for decades and having payroll taxes taken out, the benefits of which an illegal immigrant often can't normally realize), but merely how much it cost in tax dollars. Of course poor people cost more than wealthy people in terms of welfare, that's the whole point. But that doesn't mean that your contribution to the economy is a net negative just because you have a child going to public school and you have access to emergency services like the fire department, and frankly, it doesn't even mean that your contribution in tax dollars (e.g. payroll taxes) doesn't outweigh such benefits. 5. I haven't completely gone through their methodology yet, but your Yale study seems to be the only one yielding such results. Even more recent studies are coming up with lower numbers than those cited by the original conservative think tank piece, and even conservative sources are articulating significantly lower estimates than the one arrived at by that single Yale study.

Also, out of curiosity moreso. Do you really not find the education provided by device manufacturers to be useful and what would you like to be done differently? I know the company I worked for would frequently bring in doctors to teach them how to use the products or get feedback (depending on the production stage) and thought it seemed mutually beneficial (but I only saw it from one side).

Ad hominem attacks only strengthen their echo chamber and makes it look like there’s no logic to support gun control.

We're living in a society of mass data input and most are not well suited to digest the data and extract the right information, so we gravitate towards whatever information stokes the most powerful emotions. Unfortunately there most powerful emotions are going to be negative: anger, envy, hate, fear, etc., and we're reacting to those emotions. I believe the combination of: false social media realities (what people advertise their own lives to look like online), mass consumer expectations, and income inequality are playing the largest roles in the mass unhappiness if societies around the world: we're being told by different sources that others are happier have more/better things, yet the harder effort we put into obtaining these false lives/lifestyles, the further away they get. This is really the beginning stages of our natural self destruction, and I'm going to be sure to tell my kids: don't reproduce (as much as I'd love grandchildren) and be selfish with your life. It's pessimistic but probably realistic as well: today's children will be the last big generation that doesn't suffer.

How is this open ended? You don't think there's been enough investigation via the Special Council and the NY attorneys office that implicate Trump? Certainly enough that suggests investigating more. Trump is a target with a big fat circle right on his chest. The public evidence is compelling let alone what all the investigative parties know. Trump has brought it on himself by thinking he's above the needs of the American people to know his business workings. He's lied numerous times and reneged on his promise to divest himself of businesses which might profit him. Just the latests is the evidence of Russian money flowing illegally into his presidential inauguration.
