"I agree that pandering/identity politics isn't the best path to take. However, in my own opinion, there are steps that can and should be taken to broaden the appeal of the party. There's a thin line between those two things, I realize, but the party has to be grown. We have to reach out and connect with people who either don't vote, or just straight up aren't members of the party. So while I agree identity politics should be left out, quite frankly there needs to be some modernization in the party so we can expand and bring in a significant amount of new voters. A lot of these things are already starting to happen - just look at the administration's movement on criminal justice reform and possible marijuana legalization. Changes like that are a way, in my opinion, to reach out to all types of new voters without specifically pandering or playing identity politics. ",t3_a68tyk,Republican

Even separate from that every presidency gets more popular after that person is out of the Whitehouse.

"The federal government cannot order states to take on immigration enforcement. If states choose to protect murderous felons and illegals crushing the social safety net then it is the choice of the state voters. If Congress allowed the DoJ to condition grants based on working with ICE or to strengthen the regulatory apparatus to force states to comply with ICE detainers then something might be done. Another approach would be to pursue indictments against people knowingly giving aid to illegals, such as the judge in Massachusetts who may be indicted for hiding an illegal from ICE.

"Vat isnt income tax, words matter. And you would only pay the 65 percent if you were in the highest income level and spending all your money in france (no savings) and also not buying groceries or prescription drugs or restaurant food which are subject to lower VAT. Im also not sure if that proposed 75 percent top marginal rate was ever actually put into law, I always see it 'proposed'. In any case you said the 'average income tax' was 70 percent, when in reality even adding the VAT which isnt an income tax you only approach the 70 percent mark for very high earners spending very irresponsibly. Average parisians pay nowhere near 70 percent income tax according to any publication you or I can find. Also come to think of it, even in that case you dont reach 65 percent. If you earn 200k and pay 45 percent tax (90k) on it that leaves you 110k. If you spend all that and pay 20 percent VAT you pay 22k in VAT, making the total taxation 112k or 56 percent.

"That's a lot more complex than it seems on the surface. A community where minor crimes are tolerated by the community/city/law enforcement will inevitably become home to people who commit more serious crimes. A community with rampant crime isn't safe for anyone there. Making protect and serve an official thing again requires community engagement by the police, which is impossible without a different attitude from police than 'anyone walking around is a criminal we haven't caught yet.' However... It *also* requires 'broken windows' policing, the cooperation of the city government to get enough officers on the street to enforce the law, from the judicial system to make arrests stick, and from the community in making their community safer. Enforcement must be seen to be just, consistent, and even handed, which means helping citizens fix violations of ordnances that are 'victimless crimes' without simply resorting to punishing fines straight off the bat, and helping first time offenders for non-violent crimes avoid becoming career offenders. It *also* means taking violent criminals and career offenders off the streets and *keeping* them off the streets. There are a lot of places that sort of effort can break down, and it really only takes one or two to make it all fall apart. It only takes a few bad apples among the police to wreck the trust in the community. It only takes one bad policy (like stop and frisk) from police officials to wreck that trust too. It only takes one bad judge to release career offenders on the basis that they had poor childhoods - or to throw the book at first time offenders who could be turned away from becoming career criminals. It only takes one bad prosecutor to put away innocent people trying to get his conviction rate up.

"If insurance cannot function as a for profit business, why then are we not bitching about car insurance, or renters insurance? If you don’t want it to be for profit, you may as well support a single payer system. What’s your plan/alternative? Your right that health insurance isn’t efficient, but no insurance model is from a consumer standpoint. Think about it. When you make a claim, you’re effectively spending someone else’s money, and thus to a degree your regard for cost goes down. Insurance isn’t meant to be efficient for us, it’s meant to manage risk. You pay a premium for that hedge and piece of mind. The problem isn’t for profit insurance, it’s the fact that we fund pretty much all of our healthcare expenditures through the insurance model. People buy fire insurance to protect themselves from the unlikely event that their house burns down. Why in God’s name are we using insurance to cover very probable and or simple things, like a person going for an annual checkup, picking up a routine prescription, going to see a specialist for that rash on your arm, having diagnostic tests done, or having a simple outpatient procedure, etc... Instead, we should be using health insurance to hedge against the risk of unlikely and or catastrophic things, like that ER visit and long hospital stay from the car crash you just got into, the heart attack uncle bob just had, or the cancer treatment you need. Much like how car insurance doesn’t cover car washes, oil changes, etc. While it’s true Health Insurance is prone to costing more, even under the system I just laid out above (due to the inevitably of health problems as you age and death), we can and should minimize our exposure to the insurance model whenever possible when it comes to our healthcare. This, coupled other reforms in the industry to fix the many many issues driving up costs otherwise, could give us much cheaper and better care on the whole - No government programs or bans on for profit insurance needed. Unfortunately though, I’m not too optimistic that we could ever actually create such a system. ",t3_a4luyw,Republican

"The “fruit of the poisonous tree” concept applies to evidence acquired without a warrant when the law requires a warrant. It discourages the government from ignoring the requirement for a warrant when they don’t care that the initial evidence acquired will not be admissible because they think it will lead to evidence found later as a result of obtaining the warrantless/inadmissible evidence. The dossier wasn’t acquired by the government without a warrant under circumstances where a warrant was required. Furthermore, I’m not sure the people harmed by the evidence in the dossier have an expectation of privacy with regard to evidence in it. It is filled with present sense impressions of informants about what they thought was happening. You can’t argue a 4th Amendment Right to have people not talk about what they thought they observed you doing. You do have an argument that the dossier itself is hearsay, but that brings us around to the fact that it is unlikely the dossier will ever be entered into evidence for the truth of the matter contained within it, if you have the actual people interviewed provide evidence in court. In that case, there is almost no chance it will be anything other than admissible.

But if other people tell me it exists, if medical professionals the world over treat people based on it existing then I don’t really have any standing to deny it exists. I also don’t suffer from schizophrenia, but I don’t need to in order to accept other people do. Now, the discussion around when should children who show signs of Transgenderism or gender dysphoria should engage with medical treatment is a valid discussion to have. As long as you accept that like most things you’re unlikely to have enough expert knowledge to say definitively. Also, I think people automatically jump to full surgery in their mind when talking around medical treatment, really it’s a whole lot of therapy and lifestyle adjustment (years of it) before you can start hormone therapy and then years more of that before any doctor would consider surgery. And that’s for adults, for young children it’s decades before they undergo any permanent, irreversible treatment.

How are you gonna choose who needs a hand and who’s looking for a handout? And why should my taxes be increased for that? I have two kids and am putting myself through college with next to no assistance from the government. Sure pel grant but almost everyone gets that and most of the students I know have wasted it by failing out of their classes. They don’t care, they don’t have to pay it back. I do though because I’ll succeed and pay taxes and those taxes will go to fund more failure. It’s a good idea on paper if everyone actually works together but unfortunately they don’t. I wish they would reduce spending and yes it’s been a lie but at least they aren’t actively increasing spending to assist people who don’t want to work.

If you were to magically eliminate ALL malpractice related cost (all malpractice insurance premiums and all settlements, awards, litigation costs, and administrative costs not covered by insurance) that would only be about 2 percent of healthcare costs. There is a cost to 'defensive medicine', where doctors order unnecessary tests to cover their butts from legal action, but the data is pretty fuzzy. Best case, we could bring down private insurance premiums by 1 or 2 percent with the most aggressive proposals for damage caps, joint and several liability reforms, and shortened statutes of limitations. Personally, I'm not convinced tort reform should be a part of any federal plan.

"Well milatarilly Russia, China, and US round out the largest 3 in terms of stockpiles weapons, weapons manufacturing, and overall spending on military. Most sources rank Russia’s current military larger then Chinas, China has been spending a lot more on its military though so if they have not already surpassed Russia in terms of # of tanks/aircraft/ships/subs they will soon. The big deal here though is likely the export of small arms. Russia is a major global supplier of weapons, often Russia and the US are essentially fighting proxy wars by supporting/supplying opposing sides in a conflict (Syria for example).  post from r/dataisbeautiful. This is really why Russia is worth talking to here. We can’t scale back our military spending while an adversarial nation is supplying the enemies of our allies. The Cold War never really ended, it just shifted from stockpiling missles to spreading small arms around the world. Russia and the US have been arming the world for decades in this interesting assymetrical way that has really plunged the middle east into chaos. We do this because they do this, and they do this because we do this. If you want to talk about putting an end to this shit, Russia needs to be there. China is the “sleeping dragon” in this scenario. Their production capacity is rapidly approaching, and potentially exceeding our own. We ostensibly want to both stop this trend with Russia and prevent it starting again with China...we really don’t want to play this game with China.",t3_a2r8e1,Republican

"While I agree that tyranny is a bit of an overstatement they do often step outside the bounds of their power. In all offices. Like with Obama and all the executive acts he passed. He set a standard for using executive orders to create rather than guide legislation. Then the democrats block that power once it isnt their guy anymore. The constitution also endows the president with power over national security but since “orange man bad” they block all of his legislation. It’s kind of scary that people aren’t willing to take responsibility for these things. I don’t vote straight ticket and I read into everything I vote about but that doesn’t change the point of the vote. It’s to give someone power who will time and again try to expand that power. That’s the basis of the Conservative party is to lessen that power and I’ll stand beside you when trump or any republican does something that isn’t traditionally within their power. The fact is that I have to stand against democrats way more. They want big government, I don’t. That’s why I don’t generally vote Democrat and if I don’t vote republican then I vote independent.

Okay so what percentage of the population has epigenetics played a part in? People act like every person who thinks they are transgender is either hermaphrodite or has some sort of epigenetic issue. When in reality these transgender people have neither of those issues. Sex is based off of genetics. If your genes are xx your a female if your xy your male. Physically change DNA then they can be whatever but so far has not happened. And epigenetics is just how they are expressed. If it’s still xx then still a female if it’s xy then it’s a male. Edit just so you understand. The genetic code does not change in epigenetics. Oh here’s another edit you think physiologists and therapists really want to help people? Or is it like every other business where they want repeat customers. I say this with experience I had to really search hard for a good therapist because most of them want you to come back. $$$$$.

"A single bacteria cell doesnt have to gestate for 9 months then be coddled for another at least 4 years and be under close supervision and cost thousands of dollars to deliver and support, bacteria reproduce through cell division. I'm pretty sure most liberals don't believe fetuses are like the cell equiviant of a stone in your body that grows in size. Usually when hearing an argument supporting abortion a fetus is basically a parasite if anything. If you hear anyone say a fetus isnt alive its basically to dessoicate it from being human because having an abortion is never really an easy desicion to make and thinking of it as just a clump of cells helps make a hard choice a little more bearable. I have the stance that abortions should be legal so that if the parent(s) do decide on an abortion it won't endanger the well being of the mother. However I don't think it should be used as a form of a casual birth control like a condom or plan b, it should be a last resort option. I think the first one or two abortions should be fairly easy to aquire and be subject to having to take a class on birth control and general sex ed to educate them so they'll think more in the future; however any subsequent abortion should be more difficult and scrutinized and maybe price adjusted to the income of the parent(s) to deter anyone rich or poor from just getting abortions all the time. Basically everyone tends to make a mistake once or twice but if you don't learn from the first couple of times and be more safe it's on you and you should take the responsibility and if you need that 3rd abortion you should be paying more for that mistake because now you're spending more doctor time and more medical supplies on something you should by then have the sense to be more careful about. I know this got a little ranty that doesn't have much to do about fetuses be considered alive or not but I thought this would be helpful to think of for someone who just oppose abortions as a hardline stance and won't even consider it being an option. These subsequent abortions can even be taxed so money can go to school systems and to sex ed classes keeping future generations from making mistakes of their own. I'd consider this a more conservative and responsible version of being pro-choice.",t3_a5dbx9,Republican

"I was talking about asylum seekers, not 'illegal' immigrants. We cannot confuse the two because they are very very different (do yo know the difference?) For the vast majority of people who claim asylum, there is no difference. Asylum-seekers are illegal immigrants who get caught crossing the border. But I'm curious, what diseases exactly are immigrants bringing in that had previously been eradicated? A wide variety, and some new ones. Zika, for example, did not get here on its own. The scary part is that some of the ones they bring are drug-resistant. Drug-resistant TB is plenty scary all on its own. This taxpayer infrastructure argument is also very interesting, so I am assuming you are equally as against corporations and the wealthiest people in this country (including your president) who got rich in the first place off the infrastructure built by taxpayers... ...paying taxes the whole time. Trump still pays taxes. ...and he's your President too, like it or not. ...but then dodge tax by keeping their money in offshore accounts while our infrastructure crumbles. I don't have a problem with anyone using legal strategies to keep more of their own money. The impact of that on the lives and wellbeing of US citizens is significantly greater than that of immigration. Nah. You act as if that money belongs to the government to redistribute. It doesn't.

It will only cost you $200,000 dollars. You'll have to wait 3 months to get on his list and you will need to fly out to Florida. &#x200B; 2.) Newer heart surgeon, has a few successful surgeries under his belt, and one questionable one that there is a open lawsuit on. Can get you in next week and will cost you $40,000. At a local hospital near you. &#x200B; 3.) Surgeon with a checkered history but has been doing it for 30 years. $100,000 but is within state. &#x200B; It's up to you to evaluate the risk. Surgeon number 3 may not be worth the price tag he is dropping based on his record. &#x200B; Right now, you don't even evaluate the pricing. You would likely just be paying out to surgeon number 3, yet its being covered through your insurance.

"Actually about 80% of immigrants are based on family, only about 10% are based on employment. Then you have 7% diversity caps for employment-based green card, so India and China get same quota as whatever Island country in Pacific. If you are not born in India or China, immigrate to US is not difficult. Just find a job with university degree requirement, then you could get green card in less than 1 year. But if you are, you need to be a decent PHD otherwise the backlog could be 15-150 years. Long backlog also caused other problems, like our children could aged out. For example, if you have a 10-years-old child and apply for green card now, your child would 22-years-old and can not get green card with you when you get green card 15 years later. Obama give 'dreamers' permission to work and other benefits, while children of legal immigrants are still treated as fully foreigners. Years ago, republicans want to reform legal immigration system.

"It's also a corrupt industry. Health insurers have a moral hazard: they have a duty to provide larger returns for shareholders (increase profits) and pay out claims for policy-holders (which decreases profits). You can't ethically and reasonably provide both as a health insurer. It's a corporatacracy - you have health insurance lobbyers influencing government policy and you have elected officials move in and out of the private sector, particularly health insurance. Everyone is jerking each other off and laughing their way to the bank. And the big pharma lobby and the industrial farming lobby (high fruictos corn syrup, soy and other garbage) all influencing our 'elected officials'. Big government isn't hampering competition. There's no incentive for competition when nearly everyone needs health insurance, the same story was true before the ACA. There's plenty of competition, plenty of doctors and hospitals and health insurers...there's too many middlemen and too much focus on profit rather than quality of care and desireable Healthcare outcomes. Get the profit motivated lobbyists out of government. Actually drain the swamp... Which Trump didn't really do. Make lobbying illegal. Campaign finance should be funded by the electorate only, via a voucher and private individual donations. Obviously it's complex but lobbying is a big part of the problem. ",t3_a4luyw,Republican

"Making alcohol isn't itself illegal, but distilling alcohol is. To make alcohol, yeast ferments in a tank containing sugars and other nutrients, which is how we get beer, wine, etc. When people hear 'alcohol' they are typically referring to ethanol, the alcohol that makes you drunk. Yeast produces this during fermentation, but it also produces methanol as a byproduct. Ethanol is consumable by humans, but methanol is toxic in concentrated doses. In beer and wine and other dilute beverages, the concentration of methanol is so low that it's not going to harm you since your body can process it before it causes damage. When you distill alcohol, however, you run the risk of concentrating both ethanol and methanol if done improperly. This is where the danger comes in, because improper distillation can cause you to create poison rather than the gin, whiskey, vodka, or other liquor you were trying to make. The license just ensures that you've taken the proper precautions and really know what you're doing before starting. That's not to mention the fact that all alcohol is extremely flammable, and a still can very quickly become a bomb if the temperature climbs too high or there is a leak in the line.",t3_a7jzs8,Republican

" According to the OECD the British healthcare system outperforms our own despite them drinking more than us, smoking more than us, and having worse air quality than us. They cover 100 percent of their population while we leave nearly 10 percent uninsured. They have a smaller proportion of out of pocket costs and we have over 5 times as many people cancel appointments due to cost. They have slightly higher heart attack mortality rates, but better outcomes for colon cancer and fewer traumatic injuries during vaginal births. We spend over twice as much per capita, have fewer doctors per capita, and more low birth weight infants per 100k births. One of the few measures of health where we actually do better than them is how healthy we percieve ourselves to be. 43 percent of low income americans report unmet care needs due to cost.

"Obligatory disclaimer: I’m Canadian. The problem is that the US Health Care system is a for profit system. By making it non-profit, you would save %15-30 (a guess, I didn’t do the math) right there, without changing anything else, because you are not paying out shareholders, and the admin fees associated with all that, plus the tax savings that a non-profit would have. Then, you also get a better service as they are not trying to screw you over to deny service and/or payments. Just like education, child protective services, policing and road maintenance, it should be run by the government. You get a single insurer, the government. A single payer. A single administrator. It’s designed to help and care for the population. Make it mandatory for all, and fees based on income, and family size, and then you get the economy of scale. You can cut out a lot of the bureaucracy. If you cut out the billing, the shopping around, the insurance premiums, you can get costs way down. This is one reason why it’s cheaper in other countries than the US. You get cheaper drugs and equipment. If there is 1 contract for every hospital in the country to provide a drug (or equipment, etc), then the buyer has a lot more clout when it comes to contract negotiations for drug and equipment purchases. Plus, if its government run, there is more accountability (There should be!) Yes. Some people will pay their mandatory premiums, and never use it. That happens with car insurance and house insurance as well (if you are lucky). But we got this far as a species by helping each other out. And to the person who says they are healthy, and don’t need it, and shouldn’t have to pay for someone who is unhealthy, there are always the freak accidents where you break a leg in multiple places and now it costs $10,000. It is insurance after all. Currently, there is the issue of people not getting basic maintenance care because of the large deductible, or not having insurance at all. Small issues, which could have been prevented, or stopped early, now become big issues which cost a lot more to treat. In Canada, our system is not perfect. We sometimes have to wait for “elective” surgery. But it’s not because of any conspiracy. We just can’t pump Doctors through our system fast enough. But that being said, people are not going without care. I can get in to see my family doctor within a week. There are clinics or emergency rooms for more urgent visits. If surgery is needed, it’s done in a timely manner. And it doesn’t cost us anything except parking. No deductible. The thing that is quite often not factored in is the quality of life that comes with this. No stress over whether I’m going to get treated or not. No stress over whether I have to sell my house. No stress over changing jobs because the new employer may not pay for health insurance, or is won’t kick in for a while, etc. And the cost for all this. Around $60 a month for me. I think around $100 for a family, and less for lower income. The only way the current system makes any sense is if people are lining their pockets, either from lobbyists, or future guarantees of employment, because it's certainly not best for the consumer.",t3_a4luyw,Republican

For the people in that group who find jobs despite that, illegal aliens drive down wages by providing a surplus of unskilled labor. For those who don't find work, it puts them on welfare.

"That fits with my observations. From what I saw George H.W. Bush was a champion of bipartisanship. I think the pinnacle of his bipartisan approach was the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. A landmark bill, improving the lives of those who weren't that fortunate in life until the bill passed. George H.W. Bush was maybe one of the last old school Republicans I really admire. And even if I am supporter of Democrats I am saying this because I am really concerned by the state of the Republican party under the Trump presidency. I am not a really conservative guy, but I think the United States were better when Democrats and Republicans agreed on core values of democracy: I would say for example the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, basic civil rights, a fact based dialogue, respect for political opponents etc. And, in my opinion, Donald Trump doesn't respect anything of these core values. The controversy regarding Jim Acosta has been quite outraging in my opinion for example. Look at the former presidents. They all get along. Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush even managed to build a lasting friendship even after fighting a hard battle at the highest level of politics. Barack Obama visited George H.W. Bush even days before the death of Bush. George W. Bush has a fine relationship to the other former presidents, too. And Donald Trump? He mocked the 1,000 points of light from H.W. Bush, he retweeted a picture that shows James Comey, Robert Mueller, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama etc. in jail. He didn't even manage to send an unequivocal message to the American people that Nazi sympathisers have no place in America after what happened in Charlottesville. I think these are not the values the Republican party stands for. And I don't think these are not the values the former Republican presidents stand for. The Republican party under the George H.W. Bush presidency was a party I would've respectfully differed with on pretty much issues like health care, same-sex marriage, abortion rights, gun control etc. But respectfully. And because I am deeply concerned about the Republican party (because the Republican party plays an important role in U.S. politics) I sincerely hope that the party gets the turnaround from it's devaluation through Donald Trump. And personally I think George Herbert Walker Bush has been concerned about the Republican party the same way as me in his last days. I hope that the old school Republican party wasn't buried with Senator John McCain and the 41st President of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush",t3_a20cpo,Republican

"The fundamental flaw with the US healthcare system is that prices of procedures are excessive. Telling people to stop being fat isn’t going to stop price gouging. Providers are going to get away with whatever they can charge people. Healthcare isn’t supply and demand, there’s an artificial scarcity created by providers. The United States spends more on health care than any of the other OECD countries spend, without providing more services than the other countries do. I don’t have the answer on how pricing should be regulated but it’s the only way to fix this shitshow of a system. People are terrified of government involvement in healthcare because of “death panels”, but they are completely content with privatized death panels because “gobernment is always bad”",t3_a4luyw,Republican

"Morality card. Again. And I am 'brown' by the way. Not all Republicans are old white guys. That's just a generalization. And Trump is slowing the immigration process because of how many Illegals are coming into the country. 2-3 years is also nothing in comparison to other processes regulated by the government. As for California leading immigration policies, they do have some good politicians there who do a good job of pushing for useful laws, but man are there a ton of brainlets out that way. They obviously should be leading the way though considering that they have the most legal and illegal immigrants in the US, and if they weren't pushing for those laws then that'd mean that there's probably a big problem there. And as for trying to make new bills to push for company regulations, there are so many loopholes in the system and the chances of being caught for hiring illegal immigrants are too low. Those are Daniel Costas words too. There are soooooooo many new bills that can be proposed and are politically neutral and can help with the problem and if you don't think that's true then check again bud. And I can see why these people fled from their countries, but there are many other paths and routes to a better life other than the US. They can get asylum in Mexico or other south American countries with better economies and wealth distribution. There is opportunity everywhere and some just have to find it.",t3_a0ohwf,Republican

"I guarantee most of these people don't plan on going back to Honduras besides the sole husbands simply looking for work. The families are here to stay. Also where'd you read that 5,000 migrants already went to other countries? And for the bill, how do you want me to refer to a bill that doesn't exist? And for the migrant caravan and harsher punishment, the migrants should know that crossing a national border illegally... is illegal. It's not a hard concept to grasp. Why can't they wait like the 5-6,000 others in Mexico or find somewhere else if they HAVE to get in so quickly? If they arrived immediately and hopped the border than I could assume that their end goal was to get into the US illegally in the first place. Again, these people know the risks and it's not inhumane if they're willing to take it. A fine immediate deportation would be a much better way of punishing illegals, but most of them barely have any money so what's the point? They're just going to come right back and try again if there is no punishment. The immigration process should be reconstructed and I agree completely on that, however, illegal immigration is illegal. Also, I just don't like Obama. That doesn't make me racist??? That'd be like if you called a white person stupid and then you were called racist against white people.

If he doesn't Mueller might actually find and prosecute crimes which would be worse. Trump's last hope is that Mueller really cannot pin anything directly on Donald. I also think, unfortunately, that Trump might expect his kids to take the fall (if possible) for any and all crimes that were committed, intentional or not. With the reasoning that: They're young enough that 20-30 years in prison still leaves them with time to live. Whereas Donald would die in prison, if it ever came to that. You're right about all of this, but especially the last point. The GOP may decide, too late, to distance itself from this disaster.

"I just find it fascinating that so many liberals now are rallying behind Alexandia Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and other avowed Socialists, and are trying to push for a candidate that far left for 2020. It’s such a tone deaf ignorance of recent history, specifically 1972 when the far left got their way and nominated George McGovern who was completely blown away by Nixon in the general election despite the fact that Nixon had several manor scandals beginning to boil around him. It sounds pretty familiar, doesn’t it? Regardless of what the vocal minority on the left wants to believe, this country will never ever be willing to accept a political candidate that far to the left, it goes against the very fiber of our being and who we are as a nation. That’s not to say we should go way far to the right either, but European style Socialism will never go over here.",t3_a6zplq,Republican

Mueller has found almost nothing with Russia and has pursued people for tax violations the IRS wouldn’t care about. They locked up Dinesh for making videos against Obama and used vague campaign finance rules for him as well. Mean while you have celebrities publicly admitting campaign finance violations and not 1 finger is lifted. Dinesh was the only person to serve prison time for his violation where the standard is a fine at worst. Now Trump will probably be impeached because a $200k violation while Obama got fined for a $2million violation and no one even knew about it. I hope I’m wrong, but our justice system has an obvious bias and needs fixing. I didn’t vote for trump in 2016, but he’s got my vote come 2020.",t3_aal1il,Republican

"But term limits would make lobbying more expensive but also more effective for those who could still afford it. As a lobbyist, this is my perspective. The cost of lobbying would go up because a huge part of the job is establishing connections with new legislators. More new legislators means more man hours and probably more lobbyists needed to run a ground game. However, those who could afford these additional costs would benefit from the fact that new legislators need guidance. When even the most senior representatives have only a few years under their belt, lobbyists would be in Washington for three or four times that, and understand the process of how to get things done far more than any elected official do. A strong lobbying team could use this to be more effective, but like I said, it would cost more.

Predictions....no trade war, Trump in 2020, Ginsberg replaced in 2019, The wall is build with savings from the new USMCA agreement. ;/|P Seriously, we just need to let an elected president do the job. Most of the hysteria is about obstruction of someone elected by the country to lead. So far, I can see personal issues, but I love the economy and all the other positive changes. I love the Supreme Court picks, I love the focus on opioids, protecting the border, taking care of jobs and the military and eliminating illegal immigration. I see so many commenting....in my opinion....liberals hoping to divide this group of republicans or just hoping to troll the group. Republicans need to get over the division and focus on 2020. I may run for office again (yes, I was in office once upon a time) and think every Republican here should step out of the comfort zone to make sure this party wins in 2020. I know I am....and I'm out of patience with the investigations. The motive is, in my opinion, political...and I'm done. Whatever the outcome...I see any result as a political narrative 2 years in the creation. Whether fruit of a poison tree or complete fabrication by those hoping to avoid unrelated convictions...I have no faith at all in the process. It was far too broad in scope, based on information fabricated and that fabrication was motivated by a political opponent. At this point, it should end. This is my opinion and I'm entitled to that....no argument will convince me otherwise.

"Facts: Lack of economic opportunity, widespread violence, and weak institutions have led hundreds of thousands of people in the “Northern Triangle” countries of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to migrate north. While more migrants and asylum-seekers are now staying in Mexico than in previous years, most are still trying to reach the United States. From 2016 to 2017, Northern Triangle governments committed $5.4 billion of their own money toward the program, according to the State Department. Modeled after the success of Plan Colombia — which Biden played a role in crafting when he was a senator — the idea was that U.S. funds coupled with contributions from Northern Triangle countries themselves could uniquely tackle the problems keeping the countries from stabilizing and gaining wealth. Biden’s personal involvement and diplomacy with the Central American leaders was aimed at getting them invested and holding them accountable for the project’s outcomes. He met with the leaders in person three times during his last year in office. While there are fewer Central Americans attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border today than there were in 2014, President Donald Trump has threatened to slash U.S. aid to the region if the unauthorized migration does not stop. His budgets have included cuts to U.S. aid in the region, but bipartisan support in Congress for the programming has largely protected the funding.",t3_aaaxwy,Republican

In response, the government champions more and more immigration, which puts even more financial strain on the society, thus exacerbating the reasons native British don’t reproduce.

The reference to “likely overstays” reflects the limits of the U.S. Census Bureau data that are the basis for these estimates; census data do not indicate whether unauthorized immigrants arrived with legal visas. But there is growing evidence about immigrants with expired visas from recent analyses by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has produced three annual reports since 2016 analyzing statistics on the origins of immigrants who overstay and the types of visas they held. The latest report, for the 2017 fiscal year, estimated that more than 700,000 overstays should have left sometime during the year ending Sept. 30, 2017.”",t3_aaw16k,Republican

"Thanks for responding. I think I understand your point about the TV: everyone was forced to buy something from a private seller, which we would expect to cause prices to rise. I agree in general, but I think there are two things that work against this analogy wrt health insurance: (1) health care/insurance really isn't optional in practice so you were 'forced' to buy something you would (should?) have bought anyway, and (2) I agree that mandating coverage without also regulating costs (or increasing competition or finding some other mechanism to control costs) is a mistake. Again, you can kind of make an argument that you were free to forego health insurance before ACA, but then you'd go bankrupt as soon as you (or a family member) had a major health emergency. I guess you can gamble that you'd get low-premium, employer-sponsored health insurance before you needed major health care needs, but I think this is an absurd argument / situation in a wealthy, civilized society. It's not, at least, my vision for a strong, free, safe America. I don't know much about WIC but clearly they're not doing #2 from above. That's a broken system and should fixed (I get really upset about regulatory capture, which may be in effect here). I believe that free market methods should be our first choice in solving problems, but we also know that the free market breaks down in certain cases, e.g. negative externalities, poor consumer information, inelastic demand, monopoly, etc., and so we need regulation in those relatively rare cases. I believe that health care is one of those cases. Finally, to directly answer your implied question, costs are lowered on the insurance side *if* costs are also controlled on the service side. The reason is that there's a larger pool over which you can distribute risk. I think that's a fancy way of saying that healthy people will pay a little more to cover the really sick people, but the population will pay less overall. That works for me (as a relatively healthy person). Regarding controlling costs, I'm interested in your thoughts on good solutions. As I said , competition can help, and I'm very upset about things like blocking medicare from negotiating drug prices. I don't think competition can solve all of the problems, however, since health care is ultimately inelastic. Tort reform and reduced education costs are also part of the solution, in my opinion, but I don't know enough yet to have specific recommendations on directly controlling prices on treatment.",t3_a4luyw,Republican

"I got off track there though. Left wing web pages and subreddits seem to have a lot of links to scientific evidence of certain phenomena that have since been politicized. The most inflammatory example obviously being anthropogenic global climate change. Conservative websites and subreddits have a lot of pro-gun statistics, but when it comes to science I don’t a whole lot of backed-up conversation. I get frustrated by trying to stay informed because liberal bias has more or less soaked all the way into academia and into every mainstream media outlet except the ones that reactionarily skew to the right. I wish that right wingers had the penchant for meticulous citation and scholarship that the left wingers do. The Republicans are far superior at political strategy and much more socially intelligent as a collective party but I do wish that they would pad their rhetoric with more citations of reliable evidence. I do realize that the particular constituencies Republican politicians have to target are often openly hostile to science which creates a difficult situation for them. This is why I’m asking. Just because the conservatives in the scientific community are discriminated out of the conversation, it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have a voice. I want to hear every single thing everyone has to say about something (or at least as much as I can gather) and then form my own opinions. I do not need to be steered intellectually, especially not by politicians or journalists of any stripe or affiliation. Now, with all of that positivity towards the right wing stated, where is the evidence? A great place to start would be substantiating the notion that anthropogenic climate change due to carbon emissions is not statistically significant. The OP article was biased in a way that I can only describe as intense and almost hypnotic, and the neither the person the article was trashing nor the person it was hailing seemed like serious authorities on the topic. I feel like even the website name is biased: leftyliars.com. Since I realize I may have approached a troll/bot post and gotten an actual conversation with someone out of it, I have to ask, did you read through that article or was your comment just a passing expression of opinion? To put it bluntly, I am humoring the veracity of the original post article in this argument, the amount of hypocrisy in the post is overwhelming to the point where it’s darkly comedic. It’s basically just a CNN smear piece.

Since (being Cali) they have a lot of social programs they spend quite allot but they were making much less with taxes as more people were giving jobs at cheaper rates for not reporting income. But somewhere along the way, they flipped 180 degrees and advocate for amnesty for (as I understand it) all undocumented immigrants. But what was never clear to me was the reason.

"As someone who loves and has made a living by means of the firearm, I support a lawsuit on the ban of the bump stock. For the same reason I support the continued legalization of suppressors, they made shooters easier to detect, and in the case of the bump stock, make shooters far less accurate. The only reason the bump stock was so 'effective' in the Vegas shooting was simply the fact the weapon was being fired into a large, concentrated crowd, where the results would have created casualties regardless of weapon. He could have done the same amount of damage popping a 9mm handgun from his room, simply because the crowd was so close together and concentrated in one location with no easy route to escape. The fact he used a bump stock to make the weapon fire like an automatic did more good for those down below trying to escape than it did for him up high trying to do harm. It made his rounds fly sporadically and he couldn't aim. Had he had used a supressor, law enforcement would have been more able to locate him, as the unrestricted gunfire was reverberating off the other buildings and disorienting everyone down below. Had he not have had a bump stock, his rounds would have been far more accurate and we would've seen many more casualties as a result of the incident. The shooter was poised and positioned to deal maximum damage, and his choices in weapon modifications harmed his ability to do so. Because of the sheer fact that situation alone lead to the casualties that night, and not the bump stock, bipods, AR-15, or any other factors, I can't support legislation against our 2nd amendment. As a current Military service member, and an ex-law enforcement officer, I never fear the public having access to the same grade of weapons as I have access to, because that's the whole point behind the 2nd amendment. And as a voter extremely concerned with the left's constant interest in disarming the public, I fear their tyrannical tendencies and policies, and fully support the Americans right to self preservation and the right to preserve the foundations of our country against tyranny. I hope this lawsuit gets somewhere and is able to remind our legislators about the country they were elected to serve, regardless of office or position. We have a way of life here that can't be found anywhere else on Earth, and it's why we lead the world in migration applications, business, healthcare, military ability, etc. Nobody should ever forget that.",t3_a8ks1i,Republican

The Mueller probe has turned up zero evidence of collusion, but an abundance of evidence of influence. Collusion is the witch hunt the liberals are after. Interference is what any patriot should be outraged about. The **only** reason Trump hasn't acknowledged all of this is because it gives the liberals an undue footing to attack him because it implies collusion, even though there is none.

If people want to legislatively micromanage on a federal level what citizens can and can’t use (despite the 2nd, 9th, and 10th amendments...) then they can certainly try this, but it has to go through Congress. But to be clear, if you want to ban JUST bump stocks and slide fire attachments, you can’t effectively do it. All these things do is help you pull the trigger more quickly.

"Hey. So I'm a leftist who kind of stumbled into this subreddit and saw this point. So, I think a can help. I'm going to do my best to distill the logical version of each side's arguments without referencing the ridiculous strawmen that both sides use. Pro-Choice: Generally boiled down to a woman's right to choose. The murder thing isn't really an issue since the fetus can't survive on its own. Hence, you're removing a part of a woman's body that may eventually turn into a child. But it isn't one yet, and so it is the woman's choice whether she wants it removed. You get some crazies who say that you should be able to abort all the way up until the baby is born, but they're more rare than you might expect. Pro-life: Generally boiled down to 'life is life at conception'. Hence, as soon as fertilization happens, that is now a human and there are no reasons acceptable to end its life (some argue whether rape or genetic proof of disease are valid reasons). So, if you're trying to have an honest debate with a pro choice person, ask them at what point they believe abortion is wrong. Try to pin them down on an exact time. 4 weeks, 8 weeks, heartbeat, what?

I think it depends on where you grow up. I grew up in Louisiana and it was drilled in me that supporting “Liberals or Democrats” was “anti-American” and I deserved to rot in hell. I wasn’t interested in Politics until I was 17 also 18 and was able to vote during Bush’s re-election in 2004. I was rather conservative but became more independent as years moved on from there. I feel like Politics has gone to an extreme divide to either the Far Right and the Far Left which put me even more so in the middle as a definitive Independent. I don’t see it changing for some time. I don’t vote party lines.,t3_a5yert,Republican

"I can see it now - shopping around for the cheapest bargain in triple-bypass surgery as you’re being whisked to the hospital in the throes of a heart attack. How about shopping for a reasonable price for elective procedures? Competition worked very well to keep the prices as reasonable as possible for things not covered by insurance (cosmetic surgery, LASIK, etc.). And one reason (one of many unfortunately) our healthcare prices are insane, because most patients only care whether their insurance covers the procedure rather than its price. When patients don't care, there is absolutely no incentive for hospitals to keep the prices down. It's the same dynamic, BTW, as with higher education prices and unlimited government backed grants and loans. ",t3_aa9tl0,Republican

According to the cited research, feminists are not more attracted to sexist guys in the meaning of macho or male chauvinistic or dominating guys, who think men are superior than women. The type of the sexism mentioned in the research is benevolent sexism, where men are sexist in the sense that they think women and men are different and unequal because women are beautiful, nice, honest, better persons to be worshiped, served and protected by men. This can even be disguised under a label of 'male feminist'. So feminists are attracted to the sexist men who worship women, men who think women are more entitled to things then men... The point made about this kind of 'women worship' is, that it is also sexist and may create control over women under the covers of serving or protecting them.",t3_a64mnu,Republican

"Law breakers ( illegal immigration) are not believers in the values I listed ( or meant ). TIL immigrating to a new country without following that country's due process means you are a psychopath who doesn't believe in civility. Have you met every illegal immigrant and determined that none of them believe in civility? Because that's what you're saying. Reality is much more nuanced than that. You're generalizing and spreading xenophobia with this statement. That doesnt change the fact. You need to learn it. You dont have to use it all the time. Most of them do, or at least make an effort. In most cases they have to, but it takes a long time to learn a language and many never lose their accents. Why does this offend you so deeply? It cuts all illegal immigrants by nature and some legal immigration that does not want to share the cultural values. You don't get to decide which cultural values are worth sharing. Nobody does, actually. Just recognize that these 'values' you keep talking about are not so special and exclusive to non-immigrants. You're talking like they're all savages who don't understand how modern society works. They're just people trying to get by like you and me. They're really not that different at all. I have reluctance to support those type of immigration by supporting the rest with charities/social advocacy groups or even with language centers. I am not in favor of starving or harming them.

From Wikipedia: 'Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity.' I'm not intentionally trying to manipulate you in any way. If I'm making you question your own beliefs or sanity right now, you need to rethink your own arguments. 2. You totally don't need those things to live in harmony. I live in harmony with my cat. We don't speak the same language and she doesn't contribute shit, but we live in perfect harmony together.

It goes on to say this: Gender dysphoria is not the same as gender nonconformity, which refers to behaviors not matching the gender norms or stereotypes of the gender assigned at birth. Examples of gender nonconformity (also referred to as gender expansiveness or gender creativity) include girls behaving and dressing in ways more socially expected of boys or occasional cross-dressing in adult men. Gender nonconformity is not a mental disorder. Gender dysphoria is also not the same being gay/lesbian. In other words, Gender Dysphoria is a mental disorder, and gender non conformity is not.

"You want to be a drag queen, go for it. You do you. But you do not get a public forum to indoctrinate young minds with your gender fluidity pseudoscience under the guise of 'tolerance and compassion'. It is not a drag queens job to teach kids to love themselves as they are. That is a parents job. Nothing teaches self-acceptence and self-love like the visual representation that you need to change how you look to be okay in the world (I'm being sarcastic). It's just like the other mentally ill liberals who think you need to cut off your genitalia and give kids puberty blockers so they can undergo gender reassignment therapy. Any philosophy that relies on changing the body to fit the mind (rather than the reverse) is doomed to fail. Pre and postop transgendered folks have a 40% lifetime suicide rate. That's not a success rate I would wish on my child, nor is it one I would casually introduce to my child under the guise of 'acceptance and tolerance.' It's shit like this that is tearing the country apart. There are plenty of reasonable liberals that don't support this... But don't want to be seen as intolerant so they keep their mouths shut. Or there are people like me who used to be liberal but grew up, took responsibility for myself and sees how truly insane liberals are.

"FYI, this entire conversation is a generalization (ie, “Reddit is full of gullible left wing....”, “Reddit skews young...”) Yes, I understand that many Asians support the free market I also understand that many are very conservative when it comes to family values. I’m not defining American conservatism by any one single belief, but as a totality of beliefs that are quite unique to the US. Let’s take the second amendment for example- of course this is only a piece of the Republican platform, but it has become a very predominant piece and is uniquely American. When combined with other aspects of conservatism, you get something unique to the US (again, just an example). For the record, I have lived in China. I have traveled to numerous Asian countries - I’m in Vietnam for business right now which is one of the most capitalistic countries I’ve been to. However, individualism is a really different thing in eastern cultures then in the west, and individualism is the basis from which much western conservative philosophy is derived.

It is dumb to use the blunt instruments we have at our disposal to try and change sexes. Medical technology is simply not advanced enough yet to do that effectively. Maybe it will be one day. When/if that day comes and we become so advanced that we actually can effectively change people’s sexes safely and quickly using medicinal techniques, then I would not be so against the idea of sexchange operations and hormone treatments. My main problem is with the lack of adequate technology, nothing against the transsexuals themselves. Do what you want as long as it’s safe and it stays out of my business lol.

Legalizing weed (for tax revenue and getting stoners out of jails), legalizing gay marriage (so they can pay marriage taxes just like the rest of us), and having the proper social programs to support those who are physically or mentally incapable of working. The issue is, the DNC has gone so far extreme that Weed doesn't matter anymore, Gays are just entitled victims now (I guess the DNC doesn't see them as humans or regular people based on the entirety of the LGBT movement demanding 'rights'), consistently lying about the environment to make it seem like an apocalyptic problem instead of a conservation effort (which, in all honesty it's nowhere near as bad as any of them are saying), Promotion of socialism and abolition of profits (because you know, history teaches us nothing), and the promotion of victimhood over maturity. They'd rather you be angry today and destroy tomorrow than get over the petty nonsense and make the world a better place. I honestly cannot sympathize with any Liberal movement anymore because they've all been based on lies (Black Lives Matter and the Women's March), based off of skewed and incorrect data (the EPA), or target political opponents for nothing more than to see the success of their own ideologies over the nation's (Robert Mueller, the IRS, the FBI, etc etc as the investigation goes down the rabbit hole). They've become the party of absolute division over the last decade. Declaring unity for anyone who thinks the way they do, and social out casting and hostility against anyone who thinks different. They're slowly inciting what could very well become another Civil War with their constant calls for violence and action, and displays of violence and action against what they disagree with.

"Trans people have the highest suicide rate unless they transition and have a support system. When you takes those into account, the suicide rate is not any higher than the average population. That's actually another piece that builds support for the effectiveness of gender transition. What is found in your genetic code is not the end all be all of who you are. If that was the case then we could tell a lot more about someone when we mapped their genome. Geneticists are emphasizing the importance of epigenetics. In your last response, you downplayed that it only effects how genes are expressed. That's a huge deal. If the gene isn't expressed, it isn't presented. If the mRNA cannot access your genes, then those genes may as well not even be there. Your y chromosome does not have the code for your testicle. It does not have the code for your penis. It simply halts the body from continuing to make a female fetus. If chromosomes were the end all be all and expression didn't matter, then we would not observe what we do when people are immune to androgens. If the chromosomes can't be expressed then the code is as good as nor being there. Once again, hormones and surgery are inexpensive when compared to all other treatment options. If therapists were greedy with trans people, they'd avoid giving them the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. They would have a continuous patient with depression. Their trans patient is likely to be cured once they complete what they consider to be their gender transition. Do you have any sources besides your understanding of genetics and your family being greedy doctors? You're saying everyone educated on this matter is wrong.

"Thanks for responding. I think you're making an important point since we certainly don't want to remove the incentive for developing life-savings drugs and treatments! My response is speculative so let me know if you have any good references to actual studies. Essentially, I think the profit motive is very important but it's not the only source of incentive. I can get at this from several directions: 1) Consider teachers (or social workers, therapists, artists, scientists, etc.). These people often work extremely hard and dedicate their professional lives to important work that typically does not come with significant financial rewards. I think something similar exists for doctors. There is (non-monetary) prestige, a kind of power (you're literally savings people's lives every day), and a deep passion that drives many doctors. It may not be universal, but I think that in many cases the dominant driver is not financial reward: consider Salk the polio vaccine as an easy example or the Gates foundation malaria prevention as an indirect one. Along the same lines, it's not hard to imagine strong religious motivations to e.g. heal the sick or generally lead a moral life that considers but is not dominated by financial reward. 2) The private sector + profit motive is typically my preferred mechanism for innovation but it's not the only mechanism. Consider great public works (or public/private collaborations) like NASA and the race to put a man on the moon (or the Manhattan Project or the internet, which came out of a DARPA project). 3) I don't think we should completely remove the profit incentive! The details are tricky, but I believe there is plenty of room for ('mildly significant') profit without price gouging. Finding the right price and ensuring that the regulating commission isn't corrupt is a real and difficult problem, but I don't think it's impossible (well, it's impossible to get it perfect, but I think there's room for an imperfect solution that is still significantly better than what we have now). Consider other areas where there is extreme price inelasticity but where we've found mostly successful regulations, e.g. for clean drinking water. The utility companies still turn a tidy profit, but prices (and practices) are still regulated. ",t3_a4luyw,Republican
"Point 1: I’m unsure if procedures really fit under price gouging. The biggest offending issue is that we have no way of cross shopping hospitals to see how much things actually cost. I’m sure certain procedures will be more expensive regardless of what it is due to how prevalent the issue is across the population. For example I had an out of pocket rotator cuff rebuild that ran me $3500 when I was younger, I’m sure if I had needed brain surgery I’d be paying much more for that service. This is just the nature of how things are, the more rare and specialized a skillset is the more expensive it’ll end up being. If you take away the profit incentive, all you will do is eat into the pool of people who may be able to perform specialized procedures. Point 2: I addressed the amount the US spends on health care, and how much of it is wasted on preventable “diseases”. To use your words we could tell people to stop being fat, and if they listened we could cut almost a quarter of our total spending. Thats not chump change there bud. Point 3: Said nothing about death panels, that whole shtick was stupid when it first became a talking point. Regulations for the sake of regulations are absolutely a “gombernet bad” thing. Bring something to the table and we’ll talk about it, most people won’t write off a good idea. But if your side is only bringing empty noise then what good is it?",t3_a4luyw,Republican
"Have their been any studies suggesting it would help?

"I'm not talking about your everyday, working class Democrat. I'm talking about the politicians. I have no problems with fellow Americans, just the tyrants that rule over us",t3_a6gv1o,Republican
"But it's always been that way and spending more is just the normal progression of a society. And the sign that a society is successful. The more complex it becomes technologically and economically the more complex services are required to meet its needs. Healthcare prior to the 50s was mostly about palliative care, the fear was loss of wages from long hospital stays, not huge doctor bills. As it stands now the current system is too expensive and stops economic advancement by forcing people to stay in corporate jobs instead of becoming entrepreneurs. Some form of state funded college was the norm prior to the 80s. My mom didn't have to pay for college beyond her books in California. Adjusted for inflation the average cost of a public 4 year university was $8,734 in 1971. We've allowed costs to skyrocket at universities and lowered state contributions causing and unsustainable amount of debt for young people. Again, education is neccessary for more complex, higher paying jobs. More importantly, i'd argue, an encompassing liberal education is neccessary for a functioning democracy. State funded daycare, a result of more people active in the workforce creating a larger tax base and a stronger country. State funded daycare would allow people that weren't currently working and receiving assistance to get a job and more than likely contribute more to the economy than they were taking. It also assures us that all citizens are receiving quality education from an early age. Again good for society because those kids will grow up to be tax payers. There was a time that you had to pay a fire department to put out a house fire. High school required tuition and there wasn't really a way to easily move goods and people across the country by automobile. I don't think we think of fire departments or the interstate highway system as a march towards communism. Why should we feel that way about healthcare or college tuition?",t3_a4w98v,Republican

">You assumed I called immigrants psychopaths or savages by questioning the uphold of values and language. That, I will call ( even if you meant well) gaslighting. Edit: That's not what gaslighting is *at all.* Gaslighting was if I did something to you, you know what I did, and I lied about doing it to the point where you started to question yourself if I did it or not. Gaslighting is like if I beat my girlfriend regularly and told her it was her fault that I beat her up, and she eventually started to believe me. That's gaslighting. This conversation we're having has absolutely nothing to do with gaslighting. Here's what you said: *Values being civility, nobility and similar values,* and the language being the primary communication method between anyone in U.S., especially the government, I have no problem in the desire for immigrants like that. You say illegal immigrants do not believe in civility, nobility, and similar values. How much closer can you come to calling them savages? What other direction could you possibly be going in? Saying 'immigrants don't believe in civility' is absurd. Also, the language barrier does not offend me so deeply ( another assumption of great discern). I passed it, and I believe it is important for any immigrant to integrate. That's fair for you to believe, but you're demonstrably wrong.

What it really shows it's we have some deep issues in areas local economy. It could also be due to social issues impacting those areas as well. The large majority of gun homicide is gang related. The majority of children killed by firearms is 14+. Which in the 14 to 18 age group the largest killer is accidental, suicide and homicide. Preaching gun control is basically avoiding responsibility for the situation we have in challenged areas. Gun control has little effect on homicide rates although a higher poverty rate can be observed in both areas. Instead of actually taking fault and working towards solutions to solve the actual issue certain parties use it to push an ideological agenda. If we can solve the poverty we can reduce the violence. Its a little arrogant or foolish to believe magically wishing all the guns away would stop violence and suicide. we should at least be able to have an actual conversation about gun control. Parties push gun control as a matter of public safety when in reality it's always been ideological principle. Pro gun ownership holds foundations in the very nature of fundamental American principles.

"Thanks for sharing the link, but that is not a scholarly citation. As far as hormones and surgery, there is no research to prove that it is a better solution than a person getting therapy and learning to love their body. People who try to share their stories of successfully living with gender dysphoria without surgery and hormones are silenced. And much of the condemnation is self-imposed. There are social norms that, if violated...by anyone, will result in a reaction, it isn't that trans are targeted, it is that they are choosing to be targets by behavior and actions that are far outside social norms. This doesn't make any difficulties they experience okay, but most people learn that if they act in a way that isn't socially acceptable, there are consequences. It is quite easy for someone with gender dysphoria to live without hormones and surgery...and without acting in a way that brings about condemnation from society. Most people have things they would like to do, but realize they are not socially acceptable, so they choose not to because they don't want to live with the consequences.",t3_a8adg4,Republican

"You have to be reasonable and practical. Schitzophrenics will not have an overall improved quality of life by not treating the delusional aspects. The affected individuals would probably agree, so in that regard, everyone involved would largely be in agreement with the treatment. This isn't an exception. Again, the standard for treatment is group consensus by all involved. To the second part, we're not dealing with a disease that can be consistently cured. What we're dealing with is people basically killing themselves due to the conditions of their life and the transgender issue is the question of how to stop people from killing themselves. Frankly, right there, you decide whether or not you want to be involved in that discussion or not: Do you want to decrease the number of people with gender dysphoria killing themselves? If yes, then come up with answers more than 'they shouldn't do this.' If no, then why should anyone care about your opinion? The status quo won't argue with you, and people who want to support people with gender dysphoria obviously have different goals than you do. There isn't a cut and dry cure to gender dysphoria. There isn't a cure for AIDS. There isn't a cure for cancer. There isn't a cure for PTSD. There is only treatment. You can agree with the treatment or not. Some people think the treatment helps. Some people want that treatment option taken away. Here's some information from the googles. Some of it is data that supports my position. Some of it isn't.    But, here you go: A cancer patient is told that he has a treatment option: 5% chance to be cured, 50% chance that it will get worse. Who are you to take that choice away from him?

"When you compare healthcare spending per capita as a percentage of income across countries, the US spends about the same as other developed nations. Healthcare spending per capita alone is more than other countries because we are wealthier than other countries. Further, the major pharma companies are here and they dump lots of money into R&D as you pointed out. However, I agree the industry spending by consumers and the government is out of control. Soon medicare spending will exceed military spending. The problem is Health Insurance, health administrators, healthcare tort and student loans. First, health insurance should NOT be a for-profit industry. The insurers have a profit incentive to deny coverage, that's called a moral hazard; they have a duty to provide coverage but also a duty to provide shareholders with increased profits... You can't ethically provide both. And don't feed me that bullshit about profit motives increase innovation and efficiency. What the fuck efficiency are you talking about? Putting my goddamn claims online sooner so I can find out you denied coverage for my ER visit? There is no innovation in health insurance... Just increasing profits. Fuck that. Why am I paying equivalent to half my rent for health insurance only to find out when I need to use the coverage half of the costs I incur are not covered. Fuck off with that noise. Second the health insurance industry has driven a huge increase in health administrators, people to oversee claims submissions and appeals and collections and all that bullshit. Basically a bunch of worthless bureaucrats that drive up costs. Good specialists won't even accept insurance because of all the costs and less money eventually makes its way to the provider. Then you have healthcare torts and malpractice insurance which can run into 6 figures annually. And new doctor's go into $250k- $500k debt for their education when what they're providing is a public service, when legally ER doctor's cannot refuse to treat someone. Over the course of time doctor's student loans should be forgiven. During residency most doctors don't make more than $60-80k; they work 12 hour shifts and can barely get by (because they have to specialise in a big city hospital which has a high cost of living). Mind you this is after 4 years undergrad, 4 years of medical school, and THEN start residency. Obviously it's a complex problem and underlying all this is the goddamn short-term attention span and focus of politicians who don't have the mind for attacking a complex issue. Same thing goes for our ballooning national debt. Not a SINGLE REPUBLICAN or DEMOCRAT in significant office has reduced FEDERAL SPENDING or the SIZE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT in the last 30 YEARS. Edit: spelling and added 'size of the federal government' in last sentence. Edit 2: see my response to u/ptom13 comment. US appears to actually spend more than any other country on healthcare on a per capita basis. However the actual data is difficult to suss out. u/ptom13 makes a good point. ",t3_a4luyw,Republican

"I used to be a liberal, but then I realized I am not a victim of anyone or anything. The problems in my life are my responsibility, and since I created the problems I can fix them. And I do not need the world to change or accept or love me to be okay. But I digress to your point... Basically liberals and these non-binary people (many in the LGBTQ+ community) disguise their ideology as 'niceness' and deserving respect. Nowhere does any legal document state that people's ideas... Regardless of how stupid or inane they are, deserve respect. Where does it stop? Someone wants to be called 'they'? Well I'm a 31 year old man and I want to identify as a 3 year old dog so I can hump your leg whenever I want. And if you don't 'respect' that, you're an intolerant bigot. That's the fucking problem. Or you know what, now I'm a 12 year old boy and now when I have sex with my wife it's statutory rape and she should go to jail. These ideas have real world consequences. Both these positions would be considered a serious mental illness... But because a girl wants to be a boy and called 'they', we just say, 'okay I guess you're right'. You aren't doing anyone any favors or 'respecting' them by supporting their delusion. That's like telling a heroin addict you don't think they're a heroin addict so go shoot up more heroin. Trans and non-binary folks (pre and post sex change) STILL have the highest incidence of suicide of any group, so changing the body to fit the mind isn't the solution. Changing the mind, the sprit, to fit the body is part of the solution. And to your point, they ARE doing something to me - and yes I do not need them to change to be okay - but when they compel my speech, demand I support their delusion... That's where I draw a line. Certainly you wouldn't support OR respect me identifying as a dog and subsequently humping your leg (without your consent) because of my delusional self-expression, would you? Self-expression is great, just don't do it in a way that undermines the integrity of that Democracy you so value. That's what liberals are doing, making tolerance and acceptance and self-expression more important than my right, your right, everyone's right to free speech. Insane ideas do not deserve respect, and forcing society at large to accept those ideas and values is pulling this country apart - because it makes having conversations like this impossible. If I don't think in general I shouldn't be compelled to call someone 'they', I'm an intolerant bigot. No, I'm not intolerant of you, I'll call you 'they' in a personal conversation if you want, but you can't MAKE me do it. If I try to have a conversation like this with someone on r/politics I get downvoted into oblivion and get called a racist bigot. No, I have no problem with LGBTQ+ people, a good friend of mine is transgendered. Just don't make other people adopt your view point. You do you and leave me the fuck alone. Don't compel my speech, don't demand my respect for your ideology. I can respect people as individuals but think their ideas are wacko. Both things can be true. And not all ideas are valuable or created equal. And if you're honest with yourself, you'll see I'm right. ",t3_a4gr6f,Republican

If you look at abortion from the point of view that it's primarily a woman's issue it makes a lot more sense. 'Of course it's a man donating to a pro-life message' comes off as sarcastic if you're of the belief that abortion is a women's rights issue. It's seen as a man interfering in something he shouldn't be. It also doesn't help that historically speaking men have often been involved in the issue and essentially dictating how it's going to go down without much input from women. The aforementioned thinking is a reaction to this, in my opinion. That's just my two cents.

">In all offices. Like with Obama and all the executive acts he passed. He set a standard for using executive orders to create rather than guide legislation. Well like I said, they weren't allowed to pass any legislation, so Obama and his administration were forced to work off of EOs - not something done in the past because there had been more compromising going on, and the legislature was more moderate. >Then the democrats block that power once it isnt their guy anymore. How did congressional democrats, a minority, stop Trump from issuing EOs? If congressional republicans, as a majority, couldn't do that, either this statement is false or the GOP is really bad at legislating. And as far as stripping power once it's not 'their guy' anymore... North Carolina's, Wisconsin's, and Michigan's governors would like a word... >The constitution also endows the president with power over national security but since “orange man bad” they block all of his legislation. Same point as the last thing. Maybe you're talking about the wall here? It didn't pass because Trump rather unceremoniously handled this by saying it's his way or the highway. If they couldn't bring 9 Ds over in the Senate, maybe the wall is just not what people wanted. The Ds stomped the house this year, because these aren't things people want - no matter how badly Trump may want them. >It’s kind of scary that people aren’t willing to take responsibility for these things. No idea what you're talking about. >I don’t vote straight ticket and I read into everything I vote about but that doesn’t change the point of the vote. It’s to give someone power who will time and again try to expand that power. Then vote libertarian, the GOP has done next to nothing to make the federal government smaller in the last two years. Cutting taxes doesn't count, they should have cut spending if this is such a big deal. I often push for proportional voting so that more libertarian ideas maybe get some actual representation, but... This has been attacked by literally every republican I've ever discussed it with. So we're stuck with two polarized parties. >That’s the basis of the Conservative party is to lessen that power and I’ll stand beside you when trump or any republican does something that isn’t traditionally within their power. I wish this were true, but I don't see much traditional conservativism is the GOP today, I see 'we hate democrats and their ideas'-ism. >The fact is that I have to stand against democrats way more. They want big government, I don’t. This is like a meme at this point. GOP has railed on spending since before I was born and hasn't decreased it at all when in power. Either they need to grow a pair and cut mandatory spending, or they need to shut up about being fiscally conservative. I think the average liberal just wants responsible government, that maintains steady economic growth and provides assistance for everyone to succeed. That doesn't inherently mean large government, it just means... Government. Unfortunately democrats are well known for trying to get rid of those independent groups if they even give an inkling of being right leaning.

"Europe is experiencing a wave of consequences for their extremely negative actions and decisions against their own people. The EU started this when they accepted wave after wave of unvetted, undocumented, and unknown 'Syrian' refugees (most turned out to be Iraqis, Afghanis, and many Terror cell related individuals hiding within the groups), which resulted in a wave of devastating terrorist attacks the EU ignored and did nothing about. This increased European's Conservative minded interest in National Security. Following that was the constant increase in taxes and fees for 'environmental protection' and to 'combat ~~global warming~~ ~~global cooling~~ climate change'. It has been proven time and time again that this doesn't effect Co2 output whatsoever and instead reduced the quality of life for Europeans, reduced their household incomes, and extremely limited their abilities to get around and enjoy life. Following that was the constant attacks on 'hate speech' where waves of people (to include regular people and journalists) were being criminally charged and jailed for speaking their minds (ex. See Count Dankula for a popular example) who would've fully had the right to do what they did had they been in the United States. This increased the Europeans Conservative desire for Freedom of Speech and Press. Following that was the abysmal condition of the EU Economy. Greece, Spain, France, and other EU nation's have been experiencing unemployment rates upwards of 40-60%, constant government bailouts, poor fiscal management, irresponsible government spending, and worst of all, low job creation. This has resulted in Europeans fighting back against their governments for keeping the situation negative (ex. See Greek riots). On top of that, France just pressed a regulation on gasoline that drove prices through the roof in an already struggling and crippled economy, making it impossibly expensive in a Nation desperate to get back on it's feet. This has resulted in an extremely angry outburst of riots and violence in Paris, as you're seeing now. This is a rise of Conservative minded Europeans forced with no alternative but to fight back against their government, that has seemingly done nothing for the people and everything for their own interest. It doesn't help that globally 'Generation Z' is the most Conservative generation in almost a Century. Which has caused increases in Conservative politics in the United States, Sweden, the UK, Norway, etc. And it's well on the way to sweeping over Europe in a reaction to the absolutely appalling government choices made over Gen Z's lifetime.

">“Known to immigration advocates as a “sanctuary city,” San Francisco barred local police from helping federal authorities kick out any immigrants that came to the U.S. illegally.” -MSNBC This is literally what I said a sanctuary city is. Cities do this so that there isn't an underclass of people afraid to go to the police. Whether they should be here or not is not relevant when a more violent crime has been committed, and it's not on the city to expend resources on extra staff to get rid of tax paying illegals. Welfare spending reported by the US Government This just shows it decreasing since 1980, which is exactly what I said. It's not this bloated monstrosity that only gets bigger, that's a false assertion I see a lot, that you seem to have bought into... >To your point of dems not stopping legislation I just gave you a source of exactly that happening through the courts just like it is in the situation your commenting on. I’m not going to cite the source again just read it lol. The thing about a court saying a president can't defund cities at will? Please. That's bullying to an extreme, and an abuse of federal power in my opinion. You want an authoritarian federal government? Allowing singling out municipalities because you don't like what they're doing is a great way to do that. >We don’t have a free market system for healthcare. No one has a truly free market system. There’s plenty of socialized healthcare systems and they aren’t always pretty. I don't agree that citing a libertarian think tank on socialized healthcare is being unbiased. You can look at  youtube channel. If the first video you see from someone is titled, and I quote, 'SAVAGE: Michael Knowles instantly wholly OWNS herd of peacocking SJWs', you're not watching quality content. You're watching something to viciously confirm your priors. >It’s not a good scene and most of them are calling for limited speech. Based on the yaf thing I'm guessing you seek out videos that A) cherry pick people's statements that might be construed as restricting free speech and B) right wingers 'owning' them. Those people exist, but you're purposely assuming they're a bigger deal than they are. Even 10 million people is a lot, but it's only 3% of the US. My point being, you're watching videos made in bad faith of a very vocal minority group, so that you can feel they're 'the other side'. Again I feel I'm strawmanning a bit here, but this is my interpretation of what you've said. I don’t get why you’re downvoting me, saying that you support evidence based legislation and then avoiding giving evidence for anything you’re saying. It seems pretty subversive. I'm not, I don't downvote unless someone is discussing in bad faith, and as little as I can in anything I consider a discussion. What would you like for evidence? Please, if you'd like I can look up anything you want from an unbiased source. The sources you've cited, as far as I can tell, just support the things I've been saying anyway. The welfare chart is largely Medicaid too, I didn't even mention that... Like, I get where you're coming from, but these sources and things you're referencing are only convincing if you have a specific narrative in mind (in your case as best I can tell it's 'welfare bad, government too big') and you want that to be true. Citing a libertarian think tank on socialized healthcare vs looking at the spending data by country and approval ratings of nationalized healthcare services, for example. Not that one should discount wholly a think tank based on ideology, but it's hard to say that the results - the evidence - in other countries has been bad. I just don't know, that's now how I think opinions should be formed. Like you can't decide on an idea and look up information to confirm that and discount all other information out there. So I don't really know what to tell you other than expand your media bubble I guess. :/",t3_a6gv1o,Republican

"First of all, be careful not to conflate conservatives with Republicans. The GOP hasn't been a truly conservative party for over 40 years, and a lot of lifetime conservatives are aghast at what the party has morphed into (especially in the Age of Trump). Secondly, conservatism isn't a movement (like, say, the environmental movement or the gay rights movement); it's a *political philosophy.* And it's built on the idea that there are certain values, beliefs, and institutions that should be honored and protected in order to maintain the stability of a society. That's why conservatives tend to put such an emphasis on individual responsibility, family and community, religion, and law and order. As the name implies, they want to *conserve* these things. Of course, over time, certain traditions can become hidebound and cause stagnation (and sometimes injustice), which is why we also need liberals to *liberate* us from outdated notions that are no longer a benefit. A truly healthy society is one that allows for a *synthesis* between these two competing philosophies—an appreciation for the timeless wisdom of the past, along with a willingness to re-evaluate long-established ideas and to reform or abandon them as needed.

"This is a good reason why prioritization should be reimplemented and strictly adhered to by ICE. An illegal that's dangerous shouldn't be on the same priority as an illegal that has a traffic violation, or even just simply being undocumented (illegal border crossing). Every agency works within constraints. As far as cooperation, that would be great to have that communication. For one, state and local taxes shouldn't be used for federal law enforcement. Second, law enforcement must also have a relationship with the community regardless of immigration status. This factors more into the communities safety and that of the law enforcement department as well. It's hard, or impossible, to have that relationship if you sign yourself over to an agency becoming overzealous and lacks reasonable priorities. I'm absolutely for border security and immigration enforcement, I'm also for reasonable government spending, and priorities. These things don't have to be incompatible. If ICE can be structured and truly interested in deporting the worst of our offenders over all others, extend to our illegal population that has shown themselves to be decent members of society a path to amnesty, we could start building the trust back and work towards that safety that everybody in fact desires.",t3_a84xtz,Republican

"To some degree, you're not wrong, but in others, I feel like you're missing the bigger picture. First of all, most of the illegal aliens in this country have overstayed their work visas. The wall will do nothing to prevent that. Which, to your point, isnt everyone, so there is potential that a wall could prevent some individuals from crossing illegally. Second, the cost of the wall isn't just money. It's also property, ecology, and sociological. The wall would travel through some places owned by private citizens and companies. Those places would be affected by an imminent domain claim, which is always about as popular as smallpox. And then there's the transportation and installation. How much property would be damaged in the installation? Who is going to compensate the owners? What about the ecological effects? How do we counter those? And border towns have relationships that would be impacted. Arguably, some of those impacts might be positive but some will be negative. How do we deal with those? See, the cost of the wall isn't just dollars. It is so much bigger than that. The true cost is massive, and in one form or another, someone is going to have to pay that cost. But, the biggest problem with the wall is the simplest and most obvious one: it's an easily overcome obstacle. Sure, there are some that it will deter, but in all reality, it probably wont do much. After all, even if it's a 30 foot wall, all you need to cross it is a 31 foot ladder and some rope. Easy peasy, your in the USA. See, the issue of the wall is not a simple equation (border + wall = less immigrant issues). It's so much more complicated than that, and the cost is so much higher than mainstream media leads anyone to believe. The wall is really a knee-jerk reaction to a real issue that needs serious answers. Unfortunately, the wall isn't really serious or an answer. It's just a very expensive speed limit sign that will get passed over in the grand scheme of things. It's a dog whistle to call people to a political action. So, I mean, yeah, we could build it. Sure. But, really, honestly, is it worth it? I'm not totally sold on the idea. It's very expensive, and it's got a very small ROI. ",t3_a847uc,Republican

">Obama couldn’t get socialized health care passed because we’re not socialist. There were plenty of people who didn’t want that including me. If I tell people that their response is that I must hate poor kids who have cancer. What I hate is that I haven’t been to the doctor in 5 years and shouldn’t have to pay over a thousand dollars a year for not paying 4000 a year for worthless HSAs. *You're* not socialist. And neither are most Americans. Healthcare doesn't follow true free market supply/demand since it's not optional when you need it. A hospital could charge a million dollars for an emergency visit that you need or you'll die. Wouldn't be good optics so they don't, but if you think they're not price gouging... Idk what to tell you. Socialized healthcare =/= socialism. Socialism is when the government seizes control of oil, manufacturing, all sorts of industries. Healthcare could be seen as part of this, but you're running into a slippery slope fallacy there... I don't claim to know what the best thing is, but I know damn sure it's not letting the free market determine health costs. The problem here is that you're giving the 'I'm not unhealthy so why should I pay' argument, which is fine until you need it. When healthcare is a necessity, you shouldn't be dragged over the coals to pay for it. The issue is how to best keep costs down, and evidence suggests that countries who don't bitch and moan about socialism, have half the healthcare costs we do. Because it's hardly full blown socialism, and it's not a *want*. When you need it, you need it. >They declared that defunding sanctuary cities was unconstitutional and blocked his legislation in this same way lol. Being a sanctuary city just means 'if you see a crime and tell us we won't tell the federal government you're here illegally, because we value keeping our city safe over deporting you for telling us you saw a crime.' Anything else you think sanctuary cities are is a lie. It's just the city choosing to not tell feds about someone they may think is here illegally (who has done nothing else wrong). As per Wikipedia: 'Sanctuary city refers to municipal jurisdictions, typically in North America and Western Europe, that limit their cooperation with the national government's effort to enforce immigration law.' You say you don't want socialism (big gov't) in healthcare, and you also want cities to bend to the will of the federal government in immigration/crime... This is a very strange thought process. Lois Lerner plead the fifth countless times before the IRS admitted wrongdoing and said they targeted conservative groups for additional audits. I recall this being chalked up to poor management, and Obama fired the head of the IRS like, immediately, before all that hit the fan. Because an internal IRS audit had basically said 'yeah this is mismanaged like crazy', so he fired the guy in charge. I can't find a source on this *right now* because I'm not looking too hard, but I recall too that there were like 10x as many conservative groups in that tax category or whatever, so more tea party groups being audited didn't mean proportionally they were being attacked. Anyway, I don't like, wholly defend this, but I don't think it's super relevant 5 years down the line. >And yes they’ve tried to by appealing Obamacare to begin with it was a Republican who held the tie breaker yes but if the dems were working in a bipartisan manner they would have put forward an alternative plan instead of just shooting the skinny plan down. There was such a massive attempt at bipartisanship on the ACA, gimme a break. It had so many concessions when it was passed and the GOP still didn't vote for it; I can't help it the GOP made it their bogeyman. Any lack of bipartisanship in 2017 can and should be chalked up to McConnell, and I feel like you know this. >I’d like the tax rate to be significantly lowered and to watch the government shrivel up and die so a new one could be installed without all of the fat that’s been pumped into it in the last 30 years. Then vote for the party that's going to do that. Oh wait, there isn't one, because no one will ever hold the GOP responsible for ever delivering on anything ever. We just got through two years of absolutely complete GOP control of everything, and somehow all the rhetoric I heard was how the Ds are stopping everything... Unbelievable victim mentality. The only fat in government is SS, Medicare, Medicaid, and the military. Otherwise it's  video on what Louisiana does, and tell me who's really benefiting from welfare. Just use evidence based policies and a sliding scale, and go from there. Honestly, that doesn't go over great with the Ds either, but on the other hand it's so villianized by the GOP at this point it's hardly worth discussing. >I have two kids and am putting myself through college with next to no assistance from the government. Sure pel grant but almost everyone gets that and most of the students I know have wasted it by failing out of their classes. They don’t care, they don’t have to pay it back. And you should get assistance, trying to improve yourself? I think society should encourage that strongly. As far as students failing, I went to a science based college and didn't see this at all. I saw a lot of people trying hard to do well, and most succeeding. I think we should encourage more potential students to go to trade schools and whatnot - college isn't necessarily for everyone. And that's okay. But the demonization of college students to me, is a statistically exaggerated problem. >I do though because I’ll succeed and pay taxes and those taxes will go to fund more failure. 99% of people believe they'll succeed, most do. Some don't, and instead of calling them failures we need to look at the evidence and figure out how to help those who aren't meant for college succeed outside of it. >I wish they would reduce spending and yes it’s been a lie but at least they aren’t actively increasing spending to assist people who don’t want to work. Nah, SS and Medicare go up every year. Which I'm happy to pay for, sad the people getting all that assistance don't want to support policies to help out younger people more. We just differ on a basic level I guess and I’m not going to convince you with evidence and you won’t convince me with dreams of socialism so this is a pointless conversation. I'm not advocating socialism, I'm advocating evidence based legislation be what we strive for. I have a feeling you carefully get your news from right wing sources and dismiss anything else as biased... That's me making a strawman, in a way, but I think it's a safe bet... I try to focus on center-center right news, because I'm terrified of letting my biases take over.

Since taking office, Macron's goal was to increase France's economic growth and this policy was one of the first he loosened. The result was a massive wave of people got fired around the same time, then he hiked taxes on fuel. I find it so funny that conservatives are screaming how this proves our point. If it does, it only points that fuel taxes are very unpopular. However, its really a mixed bag. Macron was trying to deregulate where it was most needed, this had immediate unintended consequences that were great for the economy in the long run, but bad for the people hurt by these changes. Macron then rose taxes on gas (France is already the highest taxed nation in the EU, but fuck it, right?), which was the match to the gasoline soaked bundle of sticks.

I don't know the case law well enough to know where the legal line is, e.g. at a dollar amount per interaction or over a period of time, etc. The issue, I think, is that every interaction with your politician where you express your preferences and try to influence their voting is technically 'lobbying'. Clearly, we need reform in this area since special interest groups (mostly backing corporate interests) are way out of hand, but I suspect that sensible legislation is actually pretty tricky due, in part, to first amendment rights. Solving the healthcare problem is difficult and expansive (obviously) and covers a range of issues: health insurance, tort reform, lobbying, cost regulation, increased competition, training costs, etc. I can't offer a comprehensive solution (though I'd love some reference if you've seen good ideas). I think it would be instructive to understand how medicare was blocked from negotiating drug prices. That's a free market solution that would clearly reduce prices (though it's hardly enough on its own to solve the whole problem) but our politicians blocked it. Similarly, I would typically argue for less regulation but it seems clear that health is an inelastic domain -- I'd pay essentially any amount of money to save my wife, kids, self, etc. That implies a breakdown of free market dynamics so I'd like to see stronger price regulation.

">You have to be reasonable and practical. Schitzophrenics will not have an overall improved quality of life by not treating the delusional aspects. The affected individuals would probably agree, so in that regard, everyone involved would largely be in agreement with the treatment. I didn't say don't treat it. I'm saying why not treat it by saying that their altered state of reality is in fact reality? The article basically says all of its data is not credible because: 'Also, the researchers have not followed up all the persons who have had the surgery since 1989 for a whole ten years. Some have had their new gender for less than a decade and the likelihood of mortalities is largest after ten years.' Regarding life after surgery: 'That said, there are still many who suffer mentally. In the 1990s persons who had received sex reassignment surgery were more commonly admitted to psychiatric wards than other Swedes. In fact, 20 percent had such admittances and nine percent received treatment for suicide attempts.' I've seen this article before, and while I'm not going to address an article from 'medium.com' scientifically, I will say the article basically confirms the point it is trying to disprove. Read it, the writer says 'the transgender suicide rate is not actually 41%' because it includes other categories of gender dysphoria other than trans people. The article is a puff piece. This is the same study that is referenced in the first article you cited. The one that has no data past a decade, which researchers indicate is the most likely mortalities occur after 10 years.  Page 8. Look at the data set under table 5. Trans people who have had counseling have a 44% suicide rate. Those who have had surgery and/or hormone treatment have an average suicide rate of 45%. My point? If surgery or hormone treatment is so effective, why is the suicide rate higher? >But, here you go: A cancer patient is told that he has a treatment option: 5% chance to be cured, 50% chance that it will get worse. Who are you to take that choice away from him? Do you honestly think you know better than literally any of the people actually involved? A cancer patient does not have a disease that is in any way comparable to mental illness. ",t3_a6r8ld,Republican

"How can voters make it more clear to GOP reps that they need to stop being so cowardly? 8 years of controlling the house, 2 years of controlling the legislative and executive branch, yet Planned Parenthood is still being funded and the border wall isnt.

"For what it's worth, a lot of left-leaning people would agree with this. However, mental illness, for starters is nowhere near adequately handled in the US (happy to be proven wrong on this one) Secondly, in a situation where the mind doesn't match the body, scientists have largely decided that they're better at fixing the latter than the former, and I think, considering the sheer complexity of the human mind, compared to the body, that probably isn't unreasonable. Considering that you'd lose both depending on the circumstances of depression, what do you think of these points? ",t3_a6r8ld,Republican
