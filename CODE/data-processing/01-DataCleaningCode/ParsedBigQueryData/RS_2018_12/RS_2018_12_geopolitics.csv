About the results of the negotiations on the Syrian crisis in Astana,geopolitics,"&#x200B;  The 11th round of negotiations on the Syrian settlement took place in Astana on 29 November. Its main achievement is the fact that it was held. This should show a continuing trend to promote the Astana format as a priority in a series of negotiating formats on this topic. Let me remind you that the Geneva format is a similar tool for solving the Syrian crisis. But recently he lost his forces because of the departure of his main organizer the UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura and because of the open reluctance of Russia, Iran and Syria to activate it by their constructive participation in it. It must be admitted that the Saudi opposition has the same position, it uses this format mainly to show its requirements a priori impractical, no more. In this regard, the negotiations in Astana showed that this format was effective and that a high assembly had achieved its main objective: to annoy the 'compatriot' of Geneva, whom the same Americans consider as the main negotiating format for overcoming the Syrian crisis. In addition to Idlib and the creation of a constitutional committee, no decision was taken. But to leave at least a positive result in terms of achieving certain practical steps, the participants agreed to exchange prisoners. The second prisoner exchange between the government and the Syrian opposition is expected to take place before the end of 2018. The first exchange of prisoners between the government and the opposition took place on 24 November. If we take the official results of the current round of negotiations, they are the following. The international meeting on Syria in Astana ended on November 28, Thursday with the adoption of a joint declaration of the guarantor countries (Russia, Iran and Turkey). The document, in particular, confirmed the desire to fully implement the Stabilization Memorandum at Idlib on 17 September 2018 and to continue efforts to launch the Syrian Constitutional Committee. Russia, Iran and Turkey have expressed concern over the cease-fire violations in Idlib and stressed that this de-escalation zone should not undermine Syria's sovereignty. A new meeting on Syria in Astana will be held in early February 2019. Many countries are interested in resolving the Syrian crisis. So why are not all interested parties involved in this event? After all, as the results of the negotiations show, such a format is a serious impetus in the resolution of the Syrian crisis. I hope that it will soon be possible for all parties to sit down at the negotiating table and resolve this prolonged problem that is causing the death of Syrian civilians. &#x200B;",a48sbx,self.geopolitics,,True

How can be achieved the demilitarization in the province of Idlib?,geopolitics,"&#x200B;  Russia and Turkey are cooperating for a settlement in Idlib in cooperation with the Syrian government and Iran. According to the terms of the Russian-Turkish agreements representatives of radical groups should not remain in the Idlib area. According to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Chuvasoglu, the Russian-Turkish memorandum on Syrian Idlib is 'well implemented'. He said this on Friday, November 23 on the CNN channel. However, the Russian side does not agree with this statement. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday 22 November that 'despite the serious efforts of the Turkish side to implement the 17 September memorandum jointly with Russia, difficulties remain in creating a demilitarized zone in Idlib. ' She said last week's attack by militants linked to the Jabhat An-Nusra terrorist group on the positions of government troops in the Jurin region, which killed 18 soldiers, is an example of the unstable situation in the syrian province. An international meeting was held in Astana from 28 to 29 November, during which the parties discussed issues related to the resolution of the syrian conflict. One of the main topics of the meeting was the Idlib de-escalation area. The parties considered it important to discuss the implementation of the Idlib agreement. Turkey has not fulfilled its obligation to eliminate terrorist groups. Therefore, as a result of the negotiations, the parties gave the possibility, with the support of the Russian aerospace forces, to conduct a limited operation of the armed forces of the SAR to defeat the militants of Dzhabkhat Ann-Nusra and allied groups in the territory of province. It is obvious that such an approach should lead to the demilitarization of Idlib.",a7vnrs,self.geopolitics,,True

[Series] Geopolitics and Climate Change: Series 2 Announcement,geopolitics,"Hi all, Some of you might have noticed that I haven't posted the discussion on North Africa yet. I've been busy, so I've been pushing back the post even though the spreadsheet is mostly finished. Things will continue to be hectic for the next week or so, so I thought I'd at least find an excuse to give anyone reading this series a quick update. This wouldn't be an appropriate post without something more substantial, so I've decided to announce the second part of this series earlier than I planned. The first part of the series has been focusing on the direct (or first-order) impacts of climate change--this is reflected by its focus on the effects that temperature change, rainfall pattern change, sea level rise, and extreme climactic events might have on basic human necessities such as food and water. As some of you might have noticed, this isn't strictly in the spirit of this sub and of geopolitics in general, as things like relationships between countries have been largely absent from the posts. The second part of this series will focus on indirect (or second-order) impacts of climate change on various countries. This part will take the findings of the first part and build on it by taking into account additional information like military might, economic strength, soft power, foreign relations to gain a broad idea of how certain countries are more likely to behave when the grand chessboard morphs. I must stress that I'm just a casual dabbler in geopolitics (I studied something far different) doing this for fun and that nothing I write should be taken too seriously. The second part will likely premiere soon after the conclusion of the first. As that is still months away, I don't have concrete answers to questions like 'What countries will be included?' and 'What form will it take?' As usual, suggestions are always welcome.",a4mfrn,self.geopolitics,,True

"Games of Thrones, Sri Lanka Edition?",geopolitics," On October 26th, the President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, dismissed then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe from office and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mahinda Rajapaksa had served as President of Sri Lanka from 2005 to 2015. He was a controversial leader in part for the brutal tactics used by the Sri Lankan army used to end the rebellion of the Tamil Tigers, and the massive amount of debt incurred by the Sri Lankan government in a series of massive development projects. Mahinda Rajapaksa, at least before the crisis, was the most popular politician in the country especially among the rural Buddhist ethnically Sinhalese masses. However the move is extremely controversial because the Sri Lankan constitution does not grant the president to dismiss the prime minister at will, throwing the country into a political crisis. Just yesterday, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruled that Rajapaksa cannot serve as Prime Minister, but it is unclear how Rajapaksa will react to this blow. The political crisis has impacted the Sri Lankan economy as well. It is unclear who has authority in the Sri Lankan government. Current parliamentary allocations will run out in 2019, and without a legitimate government it is unclear how doctors, teacher and policemen will get paid. A major plank of Sri Lanka's economic policy has been to build massive infrastructure projects with international, especially Chinese funding. The government owes close to $13 billion, with most of the loans have rapid repayment schedules, and the government will have to make a billion dollars in payments in January of 2019. The country could default on its debt if parliament does not allocated money to finance its debt. So far the Sri Lankan rupee and financial markets have been resilient to political uncertainty, but it is unclear how long this can last. The recent domestic political crisis needs to be understood in an international context. Sri Lanka has a strategic location along some of the busiest shipping lines in the world and has emerged as a pawn in geopolitical conflict between India and China. China has been highly supportive of Mahinda Rajapaksa who is seen a pro-Chinese. Maithripala Sirisena has accused Indian intelligence agents of plotting his assassination. While those claims strike me as outlandish, India has long seen Sri Lanka as part of its backyard, and sought through influence Sri Lankan politics through both overt and covert means.

[Newbie question] Do you have a 'routine' in order to stay on par with Int' Relations matters that you are interested into? How do you pick your sources?,geopolitics,"Hi everyone! Next year I'll be starting (hopefully) my master's degree program in Int' Relations/trade in Korea (I've a 'Korean studies' degree). Since I couldn't come up with a better place where to ask my newbie questions, I ended up writing them here -and in the IRstudies subreddit- (hopefully without breaking any rules, if so, just nuke the thread and move foreward). So, as I'm becoming more and more interested in International relations and International trade (specifically in the East Asian area) and since I finally decided the best path to follow, I started to question how could I start to 'actively' soak myself in these topics, in order to, at least, get used to them before the start of my studies (and maybe become more and more attracted to them). -I started to read Korea's news journals (my target area) daily, picking articles from 3/4 different sites. -I became more and more interested in general international relations matters (picking articles from american and english journals) trying to select the most important ones every other day. -I started to read a book about international trade. I read the 'resources for IR students' in the sidebar and I'll try to follow what's suggested there in order to pick articles and such, but I'm still not sure on how one should pick the 'best resource' and how to navigate in this 'world'. How did you start to do it? Do you have a routine, where you check X different sites or you just read what comes up on your feed? How could I pick the best resources? How do I know which one is less biased towards a certain point? Sorry if the questions could look too broad and general, but as I was looking for some resources about 'international economy' and 'east asian economy' questions like 'does this contain everything I want to study? Is it too much? Are the topics actually the ones I'm looking for? Is the Wall street journal good for what I'm trying to do or maybe I should find something more focused on Asia and Korea? Is this other site any good? Where should I start from since I'm just figuring things out?', popped in my mind, and I didn't know where to gather those information. So, you get it, I'm kinda lost even though I think I should really try to push it in order to feel and become more invested in these matters.",a4pzeo,self.geopolitics,,True

This powerless West made non-western authoritarian regimes gain confidence about their self-proclaimed alternative values and nationalistic dream. Turkey has their own Islamic and neo-Ottoman dream.

A geopolitical strategy for South Korea,geopolitics,"South Korea is the 11th largest economy of the world and has a fair level of autonomy in political and military affairs. It is the only country - among so many other former colonies liberated after WW2 - to have achieved first world status. We have a population of over 50 million and we have an evenly distributed economy encompassing heavy industry and IT start-ups. Now, our competition with North Korea, which haunted 2 generations before me (I'm in my 30s), is over. We overwhelm North Korea in every dimension and there is absolutely no chance that South Korea would be invaded and conquered by North Korea. It is like comparing the power of US and Mexico. We know that, and they know that too. Hence, the nukes. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is the only credible threat(or deterrent) to South Korea and that is why they are reluctant to give them up. However, I do not consider North Korea as an existential threat. They are just a risk which must be managed accordingly, something like diabetes. You cannot get rid of it but you can manage it. On the other hand, the true existential threat to South Korea is China, its colossal neighbor. China's ambition is grander in scale and scope and their concern is domination, not survival (which is the case of North Korea). It is no secret that they want to re-establish its dominant role in East Asia as in those days of the Qing dynasty or the Ming dynasty and we South Koreans are resolute in preventing that from happening. China's power is growing day by day and now it has become the undisputed rival of the United States. Never has the US faced a similar rival in its entire history. China's economy already dwarfs that of the USSR at its height and is now a very formidable power in most dimensions. Therefore, I view Trump's approach on China rather favorably. Yet, the US is not omnipotent so it must have focus and select priorities. In this light, I believe the US should reach a compromise with Russia. Even Stephen Kotkin seems to advocate such action. Russia is no longer a credible threat to US power. Its economy is but 1/15 of America's. It can barely assert its power beyond Ukraine. Central Asia which has traditionally been under Russia's influence, is being taken away by China. Stephen Kotkin has once remarked that Russia was almost a Chinese colony. He even went further by saying 'should Russia crumble, Hungary would have a border with China.' I am pretty much sure that Putin does not want to become a vassal of China and that he is proud of being Russian and its cultural heritage. So what does all this have to do with South Korea? First, China must be contained but its focus should be driven away from the Korean peninsula. Second, to that end, South Korea must reach a compromise with North Korea and bring it to the modern world. Third, South Korea must help Russia to develop economically as well as socially so that it can become another bulwark to contain China. South Korea is the only major economy which does not pose a geopolitical threat to Russia. We enjoy cordial relations and Russia is viewed favorably by many Koreans as well. Tourism to Vladivostok has skyrocketed during the last 3 years and Koreans are eager to invest in Russia. Many Russians are coming to South Korea for medical reasons too (South Korea has one of the most efficient and professional medical sector in the world). Furthermore, if we could lay pipelines to import Russian gas, it will be a huge win-win for both countries. It would be a major benefit in geopolitical sense too, since it will serve as a restraining tool for North Korea's behavior. For example, North Korea may decide to cut off the pipeline at any moment but if they do that, they should expect Russia's wrath coming. And let's not forget that they have a land border with Russia. But in order to bring North Korea and Russia to our side, we need to convince the US to alleviate a number of sanctions imposed on both countries. None of them are a geopolitical threat to US primacy in world affairs. The only credible rival to US power is China. There is an old proverb in East Asia which goes as follows: '遠交近攻'(Make friends with those afar, and attack those near). It is a natural diplomatic instinct to ally a great power beyond our borders to counter balance another great power just right next door. Fear of China is what could align North Korea, Russia and South Korea to US leadership. South Korea is an ally of the US already but Russia and North Korea are not and they have their own exclusive interests. NK's is survival and Russia's is influence in Ukraine and central Asia. I believe those are negotiable interests. South Korea's geopolitical interests can only be achieved through an amicable network with several players. The KOR-US alliance is the body and a stronger and friendly relation with North Korea and Russia should become its right arm and left arm accordingly. ",aa5ksr,self.geopolitics,,True

"No Child Without Vaccination, No Family Without Health Insurance: The Political Economy of Public Health in Rwanda",geopolitics," In just 100 days, almost one million Tutsis, moderate Hutu and Twa were massacred in one of the most brutal episodes of violence n modern history. Today's podcast episode is about the process of rebuilding from the ravages of the genocide. Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front that took power after 1994 have overseen an economic miracle, and real improvements in the standards of living of the Rwandan people. I will be focusing on the ideological roots of Rwanda's economic miracle, the process of reducing corruption and improving state capacity, and resulting ability of Rwanda to dramatically improve ordinary citizens access to healthcare. The Rwandan genocide left immense social scars in addition to physical damage. The majority of Rwanda's population after the genocide was till overwhelmingly Hutu, the majority of whom willingly or through coercion, participated in the genocide. Both the Belgian colonial government, and the post-independence Hutu led government emphasized the difference between and inequality between a Tutsi elite and the Hutu masses. The RPF was committed, through customary Gacaca courts, to convict those guilty of crimes during the genocide while at the same time propagating an ideology that emphasized the shared language and culture of Hutu and Tutsi. At the same time, the stark reality remained that the majority of the population, whether willingly or unwillingly, participated in the genocide. The current RPF government, dominated by former exiles from Uganda, is unsurprisingly terrified of losing political power. The RPF has concentrated all political power in its hands, and has strived to gain political legitimacy by developing the country.

How long do you think it will be before the American political system finishes realigning itself and what impact do you think it will have on the global order when it does?,geopolitics,"I would like to start off by saying I have no professional or academic accreditation in geopolitics or political science. I'm purely an amateur in both fields, but I've begun to take an interest in both of them after graduating. **-----Basic Idea-----** My thesis can be traced back to a Peter Zeihan video that appeared on this sub recently. Now, Zeihan is an interesting guy with interesting ideas, but for the most part I think he's wrong about a lot of stuff. He seems to present remote possibilities as probabilities, like Alberta joining the US, for example. Even in the video I linked, his analysis on the break even price of Saudi oil production is just plain wrong, although I think his overall conclusion regarding the US energy independence isolation trend is correct. In short, he seems to get the overall direction right, but generally gets the magnitude and direction of geopolitical vectors wrong. Anyways, during this  is a good summary of the point, the second figure shows the US's transition from a net importer to exporter. I believe that the energy independence of the US will, more than any other single economic trend, influence American foreign policy. The US already has strained relations with most of the world's major oil producers (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela). I can't see the US maintaining its relationship with the Saudi's if a very liberal rules-based government is in place in the US and the US is energy independent. It also remains to be seen just what effect such a government would have on the fracking industry, especially if the negative effects associated with the non-traditional oil extraction continue to surface. I really struggle to envision a gas or carbon tax being implemented, even in a environmentally friendly administration: oil gas is simply too important. (5) Finally, the last addressable trend IMO is the effect of global warming. I can't see it having a significant impact on the election process, as most people already have very defined opinions on this topic. I could, however, see this new political party rejoining the Paris agreement or at least taking some minor steps towards curbing its carbon emissions. The US's maintains a vast potential for renewable energy solutions, especially in wind and solar which are currently underleveraged. I could see a green/liberal government pushing for growth in solar and wind projects as a way to balance against the growth of domestic conventional energy sources. Whether this comes from government backed programs in a similar vein to China's BRI, where the government funds the initial development and then sells the project, or through a tax incentive program is anyone's guess. **-----Closing Thoughts-----** So that's it from my end. I would love to hear what y'all think about the premise or the analysis I've drawn from it. As I mentioned, I can provide the perspective of a Texan with experience in the healthcare industry and business in general, but I would like to hear other nationalities and backgrounds weigh in as much as possible.

Identity crises within ethnic nation-states like Ukraine and Spain?,geopolitics,"One of the trends that I'm noticing is that a number of mature nation states are night now facing big internal divides, up to and including debate over the direction and orientation of their titular ethnic group. For instance, Ukrainians have long been divided between the east, where the local dialect is generally based in Russian and where many if not most people orient themselves towards Russia, and the west, which has a more distinctly Ukrainian language and a strong central European lean. This conflict is now being fought with guns and bombs. At the same time, Spain has its first far right party since the end of Franco, and their vision of Spain is undeniably Castilian and anti-Catalan, calling for the reversal of many autonomous rights. Both linguistic groups are closely related Romance languages that have been considered to be Spanish. In Germany, I'm hearing anecdotal reports that relations between west and east Germany are deteriorating, with Foreign Policy saying that it's time for the mainstream right to give up on the east. I'm not as familiar with the local situations, but South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan also seem to have big left-right divides and Hungary and Poland also seem pretty split.

Turkey and Nuclear Weapons,geopolitics,"Hey guys, I've been lurking here for a couple of years but I'm no expert so I've been hesitant to post. There was a recent post by a user asking why countries seem to have stopped pursuing nuclear weapons. There were a lot of good explanations given. Non-proliferation is one of the few things all of the major powers agree on, and China, India, Russia, the U.S., etc. would support crippling sanctions. Acquiring the necessary materials and developing the weapons is no trivial task, and the nation would become a pariah during the process. I was pondering what nations would be able to handle the pressure and Turkey came to mind. If Turkey decided it wants it's own nuclear weapons and just ignores the NPT, I assume Russia could retaliate by raising gas prices since they currently supply half of Turkeys energy. I think Russia would turn a blind eye in this scenario and might even see it as an opportunity. There are already U.S. tactical nuclear weapons stored in Incirlik. If the U.S. pulled its weapons out of Turkey as a result of this, Russia would have a nuclear power in it's neighborhood which currently seems to be gravitating away from the west. The program would be in it's infancy compared to what NATO provides. 1. Does Turkey have the technical capabilities and the resources to stockpile nuclear weapons? 2. How much damage could the U.S. and other countries do with sanctions, and would they risk the economic collapse of Turkey or civil war, both of which would be catastrophic for Europe. 3. Would there be any domestic support for such a program? 4. Am I just being incredibly naive here? Membership in NATO is empowering. What country is going to confront Turkey militarily and gamble that NATO doesn't respond? My reasoning here is that nuclear weapons would provide the same leverage while giving Turkey more control over it's destiny. Can anyone else see Turkey taking the risk?

"Conditions for Kaliningrad to shift towards The West, or otherwise integrate deeply within the EU?",geopolitics,"Kaliningrad, aka Konigsberg and East Prussia, has been under Russian control since WW2, first through the SFSR of the USSR, then later the Russian Federation. Currently, it is ethnically dominated by Russians after an expulsion of German peoples. Many Russians in the Kaliningrad Oblast have dual citizenship or visas to work abroad in the EU, however it is not a visa free zone and Russian efforts to integrate have been denied by the EU. Strategically, it is an important area for Russia; It provides immense power projection into the heart of Europe as a location for missile detection and for hosting weapons for rapid deployment, just as the region was used by Germany during WW2 for a three-front assault on Poland. In this light, it seems unlikely Russia would ever cede it's precious warm water port, especially considering the efforts at annexing Crimea for Sevastopol. However much like Crimea is still gated by Turkey, the Danish Straits seperate the Baltic Sea from the North Sea. Russia has propped up the region with lower tax rates, in efforts to lessen unemployment and encourage foreign investment. The region is relatively wealthy, and Russia has invested heavily in the military prescence. My questions: 1. **Do you see any likelihood of a substantial independance movement developing?** Given that it is unlikely to progress along ethnic lines, and no nations currently have a claim to the area other than Russia, would the movement need to be based on a desire for further western integration, less censorship, or dissatisfaction with perceived backwardness of Russia as this area's wealth leaps ahead of the core? 2. **Would Russia accept the ceding of this territory into an independant nation if it was a part of larger treaties, such as arms reductions, economic partnerships, keeping Finland out of NATO, etc?** 3. **Does the EU have any interest in this happening?** While it may prove economically viable under the right conditions, would the removal of Russian forces in this spot actually make Europe much more secure against the Kremlin?

An analysis of trumps foreign policy so far,geopolitics,"Some people argue that Trump pursues an isolationist policy. And while you can make an argument that he has with his withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Iran nuclear deal, TPP, and NAFTA. But that wouldn’t be the full case because the administration is also pledging millions of dollars to help build infrastructure in South East Asia and Central America. Rather, I would say is the he is using other countries dependency on the US (US dollar via swift, US military, US economy) as leverage for negotiations to push American interests. This has worked to a degree. However, this is rather short term thinking because if other countries can’t depend on the US they will start promoting their own self interest. I.e EU, China, and Russia using their own currencies for trade instead of the dollar, EU in talks to build their own military, and China using its economy to push back. Additionally, the US gains a lot from its allies in terms of Research cooperation, allies within the UN to push liberal/American agenda, bases to house US troops (count 800), access to materials or oil (Saudi Arabia), countries that purchase our Military technology (think F-35), and numerous other advantages. These can all go away if US doesn’t support other countries. TDLR: Trump is diverging it’s geopolitical interests away from others to gain the upper hand in negotiations but pushing other countries away from the US dependency. ",a8y9wb,self.geopolitics,,True

Summary and chronology of the out-of-control gilet jaune protest,geopolitics,"*(ps : i support the gilet jaune and pacifically protested. i'm just a random guy able to read/write english and interested in geopolitic, not a politician or a representative of anything. At the end of the post i write about the potentiality of this protest becoming a geopolitical issue but in its current state it's probably more of a domestic issue. if you guys disagree about this thread feel free to let it die in the downvoted garbage bin).* &#x200B; headline edit : i'm probably stating the obvious but i'll say it just in case : the protest isn't limited to paris, it's everywhere in france. &#x200B; # TL;DR : where did it go wrong ? 1. Government ignoring the 'whatever it was' issues thinking it would die by itself because of #2 2. none of the usual major group (union, politics, etc) tried to manage/organize/control the protest 3. and since they refused to join when they were needed they are now out of the loop. 4. epic level of media propaganda against gilet jaune : unrest became rage 5. pacific protester lost control on the violent raging mob, but keep protesting anyway. 6. it's out of control (dec 5). All attempts to control it failed. If you want to know why it's happening, i recommend this thread :  since 2015, France is at the highest state of emergency &#x200B; # Method of coordination : To the best of my knowledge * Facebook * Discord * Word of mouth * Some TV interview with announcement (but it's new so i have no idea about the effect it will have) * Waze (an app that show realtime traffic) is used to know if a chokepoint was taken or lost and coordinate support to block traffic at strategic places. **/!\\** &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; # About r/geopolitics : (as of dec 5, when this thread was created) I was surprised to see gilet jaune discussion on r/geopolitics but then, since i'm in france, i obviously see it as a domestic issue but i also wish it would be an intergalactical issue (make sense, right ?). Now... we're far from the arab spring. But the current protest \*may\* have a potential impact on international politic if it succeed. At least, it have some potential as a geopolitic issue. Not in its current state however. But the upsetting became hatred at an alarming rate. It's not May 68 and it's not 1789, not worse, not better, it simply is different. It's obviously not the fall of USSR. If it happened is US, russia, china it would be a world crisis but france isn't either of them. It's just a few thread here and there and i find it interested to see some discussion about it that record in pretty much realtime 'what-the-F'-just-happened?' and its evolution. Because if it become a full blown geopolitic issue at least the basics will be covered.

Of course, Russia is the lesser power when compared to the US or China but still they have retained most of nuclear arsenal inherited from the Soviet Union. They will not succumb to anybody and they will actively push their own agenda. However, Europe is deeply divided and they invest almost nothing in hard power compared to the other great powers. The fiasco during the Libyan intervention has proved how utterly unprepared were the Europeans(or the French to be more specific) when it comes to foreign adventures.

While it would be disasterous for Turkey, Iraq and Iran, it would appear that Iran would have less to lose since their Kurdish region is smaller in extent and close to Tehran's power projection. Would Israel respond favourably to the new ethnostate? While the Saudi's aren't friends of revolution, they would surely like to destabilize Iraq.

"Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Waste Plastic?",geopolitics," Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China. To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world. It is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it. The Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total. However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad. **Selected Sources** ",a78ai7,self.geopolitics,,True

How can the US maintain its influence in such a world? How should the US act to prevent China from turning Africa into a set of satellite states using OBOR loans? How can the US contain China, with few and weakening allies in the region? South Korea is tiny and has a demographic crisis, Japan has a demographic crisis, Taiwan is tiny, militarily backwards, and has a demographic crisis. If China tries to reclaim Taiwan, either through war or through slow infiltration and subversion, what should the US do to protect Taiwan and to maintain the island chains around China? How should the US maintain its economic competitiveness when wages are too high to compete with low tech manufacturing and when there are not enough STEM graduates to maintain the US's lead in high tech manufacturing/services? Should the US fight as long as possible to keep the number one spot, or accept its decline quietly, go isolationist, and let China become the world's hegemon?",a6avob,self.geopolitics,,True

America - A Modern Empire or Global Hegemon?,geopolitics,"Brace for a LONG post, context is necessary to the debate (and let's keep the responses relatively unbiased, somewhere in the middle between Noam Chomsky and Rush Limbaugh). We today tend to have a knee-jerk negative reaction to the word 'empire' because of the (deservedly) negative historical connotations it carries, its association with tyranny, and because of portrayals in media (Star Wars). But empires can take many forms, and some are far more enlightened and liberal than others. The most basic definition of empire building I can think of is 'the expansion of controlled territory, cultural domination, political influence, and commerce (and the protection of such), whether it's by force or by natural consequences of history.' By this definition it certainly seems like the US is an empire. Max Boot and Neil Ferguson certainly believe this. But when most people think of empire, they think of singular motivations of greed, of plundered lands, demanding high taxes and tributes, systematic abuse of natives, violence, direct administration of conquered lands, repression of rights and free expression, and slavery (again, history backs this viewpoint), committed in varying degrees by nations like Britain, France, Spain, Belgium, and especially Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and Imperial Japan. Earlier US history could certainly be described as traditionally imperial: buying and assimilating new lands into the civilization, at the expense of the previous native inhabitants; slavery continued for its first 89 years; we fought Barbary pirates to safeguard our shipping in 1803; we made numerous military incursions into Central and South America to punish governments we saw as misbehaving or to safeguard our property, citizens, and economic interests (which also tied in with other security and ideological aims). The United States has not engaged in any of this for more than 80 years (unless you count when we tolerated abusive practices by our proxies during the Cold War). Most people in America would use the word 'hegemon' to describe us since 'empire' carries so many negative connotations. Much of our power is 'soft' power, ranging from diplomatic to cultural to economic. These are the main tools by which we spread our values and exercise influence. If 'domination' is your only criteria you could certainly argue that we have a cultural and economic empire, since we have such a pervasive culture and the world's largest economy, which happens to affect the world economy to quite a large degree. I don't necessarily regard using soft power or even subterfuge to protect interests and further influence as imperialism (many countries do the same thing), but it appears as such to some because of our sheer size. This economic power was both inadvertent and intentional. Inadvertent in that we did not design the two devastating world wars in Europe and one in Asia that left us as an economic giant in a world of ruined great powers, leaving plenty of room for us to pick up the slack. Yet, intentional in that we spent decades building ourselves into an international commercial power, sometimes using force to defend our economic interests (the Marines made nearly 100 landings at various times in South and Central America), sometimes by territorial conquest and/or annexation, sometimes by Dollar Diplomacy. This mission of expansion was deemed necessary to a) guarantee economic growth, b) secure the western hemisphere from the predations or competitions of some forms of European imperialism (a lot of people forget that European countries had designs in this hemisphere up until the very early 20th century), and c) ensure the stability and prosperity of our southern neighbors so we might 'pass on the blessings of high civilization,' so we might have a greater mutually beneficial relationship with them. Men like Theodore Roosevelt were real believers in this mission of making us the 'anti-imperial empire.' However, Roosevelt pointedly rejected using military force for expansion, and insisted that in dealings with the Latin American nations, he did not seek national glory or expansion of territory and believed that war or intervention should be a last resort when resolving conflicts with problematic governments. According to Roosevelt, such actions were necessary to maintain “order and civilization.' The most control Roosevelt sought was some control over those countries' finances so their debts could be repaid, or securing protection for American property. It was also intentional in that we designed a new international system that we would largely be the head of because we had, in the words of SecState Dean Acheson a unique opportunity to 'grab the world by the horns and make it conform.' They saw the coming trend of globalization and the inability to avoid dealing with the wider world in future, and decided that in light of the destructive conflicts we'd been dragged into, brought on by the deadly mix of ultranationalism, authoritarianism, and self-interested balance-of-power politics in Europe and Japan, we needed to shape the international environment in a way that would be friendly and safe for us, our values, and our economic interests. So, we now have what's referred to as the 'liberal world order,' with the hegemon (us) acting as leader and guarantor. It was really in the interest of protecting this vital order, rather than just our homeland, that we fought the Cold War, since the Soviet imperialists were just as intent on throwing their weight around as a superpower. We certainly caught many accusations of imperialism for our backing of various juntas and dictators in the third world during the Cold War, simply because they were protecting our strategic and economic interests. This was, however, a result of Cold War paranoia, policy planners' list of priorities, and their assumptions that authoritarianism could more easily evolve into democracy than totalitarianism could. Ever since the Cold War ended though, we've either actively encouraged or allowed democracies to spring up in many of those places, even those unfriendly or openly hostile to us (see Hugo Chavez and Roberto Duterte), with much greater tolerance than we demonstrated before. We've also forgone gunboat diplomacy. Our military campaigns today, while obviously focused on protecting the flow of oil out of the middle east (and keeping it out of Russian and Chinese hands) aren't done in the name of conquest; we had already fairly negotiated the purchase of oil decades before. We're certainly not stealing any of it. We're not even the primary consumers, our trading partners in Europe and Asia are. We don't have or exercise control over a lot of our allies in that region, in fact they often defy us or act against our interests (see Arab oil embargo, Turkey's treatment of Kurds, MBS's recklessness in Saudi Arabia. Our most famous campaigns of the 20th century, WWII, Korea, Gulf War I, even Vietnam, were all intended as campaigns of liberation from one form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism or another, even though we had our own interests there too, and most of them are all now flourishing democracies. Korea and Vietnam were not deemed to be of vital strategic or economic importance at the time of those conflicts (other than where Domino theory was concerned), but we spent blood and treasure there anyway. We continue to guarantee the defense of Taiwan to this day, even though we could easily replace the trade we get from them elsewhere, and they're not indispensable to our regional military security since we have Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. We don't even have a military presence on that island anymore. None of this is characteristic of traditional empires throughout history. So, my personal conclusion is that while part of our history could be described as imperialistic, that is no longer really the case. We've got the power and responsibilities of an empire, but we act more like a hegemonic superpower that seeks to influence and shape the international system and environment rather than seeking conquest by traditional means.

What do you think of Acemoglu and Robinson's argument that Chinese prosperity will reach a plateau due to a lack of progress in developing inclusive economic and political institutions?,geopolitics,"In their book 'Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty', economists Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson explore the role of institutions in poverty and wealth. Towards the end, they comment on the case of China, where there has been unprecedented economic growth since the 1990s in spite of the Communist Party maintaining large degrees of control over the Chinese economy. The pair argue that despite making huge strides towards inclusive economic institutions since Deng Xiaoping's reforms, China's economic growth is 'an example of growth under extractive political institutions'. As China's development level catches up to that of western countries, entrepreneurs must be given more room to ply their trade and take advantage of opportunities without being afraid of what the CCP may think. Otherwise the Chinese economy will stagnate and struggle to be competitive. To put it simply (in their words): 'China has achieved economic growth not thanks to its extractive political institutions, but despite them'. While Deng Xiaoping's reform played a vital role in facilitating this growth, there will come a time in the future when China is faced with the option of political liberalisation or economic stagnation. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on this matter. To what extent are Chinese leaders willing to tolerate further liberalisation?

Why Trump withdraws from Syria,geopolitics,"&#x200B;  The United States begins to withdraw its troops from Syria. According to President Donald Trump, their task is accomplished - the Islamic State terrorist group (IG) has been defeated. However, the statement of the head of the White House testifies not so much about the final victory over the ISIS, which has not yet occurred, but about the desire to draw a line under the not very successful strategy of the current American administration in Syria. Now the most difficult thing for the White House will be to prove that according to the results of their participation in the Syrian campaign, the beneficiary was the United States, not Russia. Announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria, Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that the United States had achieved victory in this country over the ISIS, and the fight against it was the only reason for the presence of the American contingent there. Employees of the administration of Donald Trump soon reduced the pathos of the statements of his chief, noting: this is about the beginning of a new phase of the struggle. Thus, according to the press secretary of the White House, Sarah Sanders, the United States and its allies will continue to work together to 'deprive the radical Islamic terrorists of the territory of funding, support and any means of penetration through the borders.' It is noteworthy that the decision to withdraw troops from Syria was made despite requests from US allies in the region — Saudi Arabia and Israel — who asked Washington to stay in Syria to counter Iran’s attempts to consolidate its strength in Syria and in the region as a whole. Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, while in the United States, personally addressed the president. At his request, Donald Trump responded: if Riyadh wants the Americans to stay in Syria, they will have to pay. In August, it became known that the US foreign allies agreed to allocate almost $ 300 million for stabilization in Syria. Of these, $ 100 million was to be provided by Saudi Arabia, and $ 50 million by the United Arab Emirates. The US decision was also a surprise because it sounded at the moment when Turkey was preparing an operation in the north of Syria against the Kurdish formations. The only guarantee of the security of the Kurds was the United States. The expert of the American CNA Corporation research center, Michael Kofman, agrees that the announcement of the withdrawal of troops may be a maneuver that is designed to distract the audience inside the United States from the internal political situation unfavorable to Donald Trump. The decision of President Trump was ambiguously perceived both in the United States and among their closest allies. 'A huge mistake' called him Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, noting: 'The ISIS is not defeated.' The fact that “the threat remains”, and the group only “transformed into other forms of extremism,” said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Britain Tobias Ellwood. &#x200B;",a93gey,self.geopolitics,,True
Will 2019 see a major geopolitical re-alignment in the Middle East?,geopolitics,"During the last two months of 2018, four major developments have occurred in Syria. First, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , much of Saudi Arabia's -- and by extension the Gulf states minus Qatar's -- recent foreign policy has been in response to Turkey's growing power and potential to threaten the traditional Saudi/Gulf state hegemony of the Sunni world in general and the Sunni world within the Middle East in particular. If Saudi Arabia wants to contain Turkey, the both the deployment of Saudi and Emirati troops into Northern Syria and the Kurdish/Gulf state efforts to reconcile with Assad would absolutely make sense. And if Assad accepts these olive branches, that could change everything. No, that's not an understatement. In the aftermath of such a scenario, we must pay close attention to five countries: 1. **Turkey**. Relations between Turkey and much of the Arab world are already at an all-time low. Turkey's relationship with Syria and Egypt have completely collapsed over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's support of anti-government movements in those countries. Meanwhile, tensions between Turkey and every Gulf state except Qatar have been growing for geopolitical (and to a lesser extent ideological) reasons. Turkey's relationship with Saudi Arabia in particular has deteriorated following the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. And then of course, there are the Kurds, no explanation needed there. A newly-found friendship between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds would likely make their relations with Turkey even worse, as the Turks sense a clear attempt at containment in Northern Syria. 2. **Iran.** Iran's relations with the Gulf states (especially Saudi Arabia but minus Qatar) are even worse than Turkey's relations with those countries. For this reason, there is a good chance that the Iranian response to a reconciliation between Assad and the Gulf states will be harsher than the Turkish response. But how far will Iran go? If history indicates anything, all options appear to be on the table. Just over a year ago, former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was assassinated by his former (Iranian-backed) Houthi allies after he attempted to reconcile with the Gulf States in the midst of a civil war in his country. If Iran and/or its proxies could turn against and/or kill Saleh over his communications with the Gulf states, then they could do the same with Assad. Should they pursue that course of action, there can be only two outcomes. First, if Assad is killed or overthrown, that would likely make the war in Syria much, *much* worse. Not only could such an event start a new wave of uprisings, we could also see some of Assad's former allies within the country *joining* those uprisings over the issue of Syria's relationship with Iran. Alternatively, if Assad is *not* killed or overthrown, the Syrian-Iranian alliance would collapse. Syria would defect from the pro-Iranian camp to the pro-Saudi camp, while Iran would switch sides in the war -- and perhaps form an alliance with Turkey in the process. 3. **Russia.** If the Syrian-Iranian alliance collapsed, Russia would face a serious predicament. It would be forced to choose which ally is more strategically important: Syria or Iran. If Russia chooses Syria, then it gets to keep its naval base in Tartus and enjoy better relations with the Gulf states, but it also loses any clout it once had with Iran and Turkey to use against American influence in the region and perhaps faces a greater risk of terrorist attacks on its soil. If Russia chooses Iran, then it solidifies the 'Eurasian Alliance' with Iran and Turkey against American influence in the region, but it also loses its naval base in Tartus and perhaps suffers its greatest humiliation on the international stage since the end of the Cold War. 4. **The United States.** If the outcome of the reconciliation between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds results in them moving closer to Russia, the United States could be very tempted to forge closer ties with Iran and Turkey to form a regional counterbalance. Should that happen, we could end up seeing Donald Trump doing a 180 on some of his current Middle East policies, such as opposition to a nuclear deal with Iran, recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and support of a Saudi-led 'Arab NATO.' 5. **Israel.** Israel's number one priority right now is Iran. If you're anti-Iran, you're the good guy, according to Israel. If Turkey, Russia, or the United States form closer ties with Iran as a result of the new re-alignment, odds are Israel's relations with those countries will seriously deteriorate in coming years.

Attended a speech given by Michael McFaul last night.

He says that during Medvedev’s administration, the US-Russia relations were the best they had been in 70 years. He pointed to the fact that, when polled, Russians had overall positive opinions of Americans, and Americans had positive opinions of Russia. Russia also helped immensely with getting Iran to negotiate on the Iran deal. Putin was disgusted by Medvedev fostering warm relations with the US, which is why he took the presidency back and immediately burned all the bridges that Medvedev built with Obama. The impression throughout the speech that I got is that Putin has been the main deterrent stopping cooperation between the US and Russian regime.

The Monroe Doctrine in the 21st Century,geopolitics,"What is the Monroe Doctrine in the 21st century? The Monroe Doctrine has had a long history and many iterations, but it boils down to a simple principle: foreign powers should leave the Western hemisphere alone for the US to stabilise and grow to dominate. Geopolitically this is good for the US; by virtue of it's geopolitical advantages, the US has no regional rivals in the Western hemisphere politically, economically or militarily and preventing any power from interfering allows it to secure it's borders and interests, and project it's power to the rest of the world instead, making sure any rival cannot emerge. Proclaiming an age of great power competition, the US has identified China and Russia as great powers seeking to compete with the US to some extent. It follows that they would seek to increase their influence and power in North and South America, so as to keep the US occupied and distracted from their corresponding vital areas. At the same time, the US is reassessing it's commitments around the world , from security and trade, while the domestic political structures are under going a transformation not seen since the Great Depression. Most expect the US to be less involved in global affairs as it relooks at it's commitments, and usually, attention is given to the countries much closer to home in the Americas. Already the has been economic change in the NAFTA renegotiations, resulting in more favourable terms for the US. With a foreign policy that puts the raw interests of the US first, it is expected the US will continue to pursue more favourable conditions for itself,",aanhu5,self.geopolitics,,True
The Future of the World Order?,geopolitics,"Reading some Kissinger recently got me thinking: what is the future of the liberal world order? Nationalism, sovereignty, quasi-isolationism, and preservation of culture seem to be the rallying cries today, going against many of the 'globalist' opinions of the 'party of Davos' shared by many in the foreign policy and cultural elite in western capitals. This is understandable in light of a rash of what are perceived (many would argue rightly so) to be poorly-informed-and-executed (politically) military interventions and international policy by the west over the last 20 years. It's understandable that Americans in particular want to run back to our shores at this point, but this seems unrealistic given our size and power as a nation, and in an increasingly globalized world we do not want other powerful interests to arrange the world in their favor and against ours, as China appears likely to try to do. So, how will the next world order, the 'fourth founding' (to borrow from Giddeon Rose), balance the competing interests of both existing and rising Great Powers and regional powers, while also handing back greater autonomy and sovereignty to the nation states as envisioned at the Treaty of Westphalia? How will the liberal revolution/evolution be continued, if at all? Furthermore, how will America in particular define its role and foreign policy in an inevitably multi-polar world? Will we revert to Theodore Roosevelt's and Richard Nixon's realpolitik? Will we continue attempting a pursuit of Wilsonian idealism? Or will we continue on a Kissingerian middle path as we have for decades, pursuing idealistic goals where convenient, necessary, and profitable while balancing them with realist policies elsewhere? In other words, 'principled realism?' Discuss below. ",a9w2lq,self.geopolitics,,True

Why has Israel’s birthrate remained high despite being a developed country with a high quality of life?,geopolitics,"In 1992, Israel’s fertility rate was 2.7. Instead of falling like other developed countries, it has actually been rising, and has reached a rate of 3.11 in 2016. This seems to go against the regular trend of countries struggling to reach the replacement rate of 2.1 as fertility rates fall while the quality of life improves.

Why is the Russian Economy so weak?,geopolitics,"Hey guys, I'd like to have a discussion on this topic, given the popular consensus that Russia is on a slow decline and unable to compete as a world power due to its weak economy. It seems bizarre, given how powerful the USSR was at its peak; I have even seen some posters here cast doubt on whether the Russian Federation will maintain statehood within the next half century. This topic certainly bears further investigation as it will inform Russia's relations with other powers and how it selects its alignments. I will start off with some of my thoughts, and encourage others to critique, add to them and/or use them as a base for injecting additional insight. Firstly, I suspect that the chaos that followed the fall of the USSR laid the seeds for dysfunction. To what extent, and in what manner, I would seek clarification on. Did Western exploitation wreak deep wounds that are still felt today, or are the damages from that time largely past? I realize that some large part of Russia's economic troubles have to do with an oligarchy of resource barons who stymie any real forays into diversifying the economy or moving away from resource exportation, but surely, given Russia's immense territory, it's utter lack of proportional heft is baffling. Given the expanding trade relations between Russia and the PRC, do you think the relationship will remain resource heavy? It does not seem like a sustainable approach to me and Russia could do better. This large expanse of territory does come with its curse of course. The logistical nightmare involved in keeping the country togethe is quite unenviable. Aging infrastructure needs to be maintained, extensive military hardware has to be kept up to date, all to the backdrop of harsh climatic conditions which exacerbate upkeep costs. Russia's only warm water port in Vladivostok still sees significant downtime due to inclement weather, and is located on an extreme of the country. How debilitating is this for trade aspirations beyond Eurasia? Namely the Americas, SEA, and Africa? While it's population isn't huge, it's still very respectable, notwithstanding the challenges of advancing median age; I postulate that shortened life expectancy may play some part in reduced economic capacity. Some other posters here have mentioned the crippling loss in military age citizens that awaits in a few decades, but how will this in turn affect economic activity given that many developed nations are also facing a similar challenge? Will automation start to become a way for states with lower populations to level the playing field? Corruption and criminal activity (Intl Rus Mafia) How significantly do these two hemorrhage the economy? Do you see any meaningful action taken to curb the two, and what would it look like? Foreign adventurism This is a clear avenue from which Russia is draining its coffers. It must do so to exert itself in one of the only ways it still can on the international stage, and to protect its interests, but how long can these costly exertions be sustained? Food for thought. Research competitiveness Foreign investment attractiveness/ease of doing business/international sanctions Does the current administration's policy discourage foreign business or investment? If so, how and why? Are foreigners put off by perceived barriers to entry? Are sanctions making a sizable dent in growth numbers? Sorry for the fall off in quality. It's getting late and I just wanted to kick this off. Take it away fellows. ",a63ocm,self.geopolitics,,True
"This is perhaps a bit off the wall, but what do you make of the Dark Forest theory from Liu Cixin's Three Body Problem?",geopolitics,"To properly ask this question I have to spoil a main plot point of this book series. Read no further if you wish to avoid spoilers. ---- In Liu Cixin's *Three Body Problem* trilogy, we are introduced to a realist concept called the Dark Forest Theory, which applies exclusively to galactic politics, assuming a couple of so-called axioms, and implicit principles, about galactic civilizations. The first of these is that survival is the primary need of a civilization. The second is that civilizations always grow and expand, exponentially within resource constraints, but the amount of matter and resources in the universe are finite. The third, implied in the novel, is that an individual civilization's technology advances non-linearly in unpredictable booms that dramatically affect the strategic balance of power between separate stellar/galactic states over the course of centuries and millennia. Given these principles, the argument is that galactic civilizations have an incentive to seek, invade or destroy any other civilization at a lower tier of technology in their vicinity, because if they don't, these civilizations may leap frog ahead of them in technological capacity, and choose to destroy *them* in self-defense. Galactic civilizations similarly have a reason to hide from civilizations that are at a higher tier of technology, because such civilizations have an incentive to seek, invade or destroy civilizations at a lower tier of technology. Interstellar cooperation and peace is perhaps impossibly limited by the fact it can take on the order of hundreds to thousands of years to travel and communicate between stellar states, and so realist political considerations require us to treat the galactic community as being in a state of constant total war where everyone is hiding from everyone else, and seeking to annihilate anyone who makes themselves known. This menacing environment is aptly called the Dark Forest theory, as if the galaxy is like a dark forest in which we must be quiet and hidden, lest we attract the attention of monsters in the night. The Dark Forest theory could explain the Fermi paradox, the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. So this is more about galactic politics than geopolitics, but in the the issue seems related to our study of international affairs, and worth taking seriously given the unknowns and severe, life threatening stakes. What do you all make of the Dark Forest theory? Should we be concerned? What sort of prior should we place on this theory? Is this a reason to cease all active SETI programs of deliberate transmissions from Earth?",a7rb13,self.geopolitics,,True

Democracy in Latin America - Whats the US Doing?,geopolitics,"We all know how many right wing Latin American anti-communist dictators America helped to install and continued to support during the Cold War, in the interest of protecting economic and strategic interests, and making the devil's bargain for authoritarianism versus either literal or potential totalitarianism (the efficacy and necessity of that policy is the subject for another debate). Now that the war has been over for 27 years, democracy has made a massive resurgence in that region, and US and other foreign economic aid and investment has dramatically helped to transform their economies. But democracy may be in crisis there, with rampant corruption, the resurgence of socialist movements, the growth of the narco trade, high crime, high poverty levels, growing Chinese influence, and numerous other factors are putting both democracy and US interests in the region at risk. My question is, what has the US done since the end of the Cold War, what is it currently doing, and what is it likely to do in future to help solve these problems? What US policies may actually be counterproductive to this end, other than the continuation of the war on drugs?",aaibxw,self.geopolitics,,True
