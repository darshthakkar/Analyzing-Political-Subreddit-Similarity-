However you see the hidden world when working with a criminal population and their families. America's problem is that it lowers the bar and encourages it. Especially in our education system. We make things more lenient for those who don't want to do something or can't. When we lower the bar, it doesn't go back up. America's culture and morals are bankrupt in a sense. Our political system is too big, not transparent, and our politicians who can't get around the constitution often turn to businesses/monopolies who can. Remember those facebook 'grillings' of Zuckerburg? The only thing really asked, 'Will you cooperate in making laws and policies with us?' This is how they try to own shit they can't, and the more I realize they aren't too different from the criminals I work with. Social justice warriors tend to be criminally minded as well, as everything they due is for self gain or standing. Yes slavery and bigotry are wrong, no shit. The left and right both suck and our leaders don't lead. In the state I'm in, the liberal minded leaders wanted to lower sentencing for REPEAT drug offenders. This is a prime example of the arrogance that the left has, the thought THEY can FIX things. Most folks take plea bargains, and often times aren't convicted of the original charge. Republicans own greed often ruins them. America's culture/multi-culture is where our troubles start. No no it doesn't mean be white, and if you think I'm going there go roll down some stairs. We should allow ideas as wild as they are and speech as wild as it can be, but what happens when the dominant train of thought is misguided? What happens when enlightenment and work is overshadowed by high horse morals and sloth? Who decides what's what? As Hayek would assert. Common sense isn't common, but Americans need to stop expecting Altruism from one another. We've been trained not to succeed, but to do things at the expense of others. Obamacare taking your money, that asshole boss who dumps his work on you, that criminal who steals from the old lady, Facebook stealing your shit, the monopoly setting an outrageous price because they can and won't be checked, you can go on. It all operates on deceit, half-truths to alleviate guilt, and the willingness of the victims to be just that. Fact is you, me, any bleeding heart liberal is in this shit together. This system and these fuckwits in charge aren't there for me and you, and I feel our political climate is intensifying. Citizens vote sure, but we don't RUN shit. Our strength is in our community and ability to communicate and work together effectively. I've come to realize with all of the labels being thrown around, that the criminals I work with can often be a guy who just did some dumb shit, and watching him struggle in the system is a natural consequence but one that also makes you think does this dude really need this? Why do the REPEAT offenders get the wrist slaps? Ooooohhhh because the bar is lowered for them. So for your everyday American, we have to ask, well what's the bar for the people who tell us what to do? How do we hold them accountable? Are they not criminals because they don't have a conviction? In summary, Americans are criminally minded and it's encouraged. We have to get away from the name calling and beggar culture that has become dominant. Our icons should be good people not Kim and Kanye. Stop expecting that we have to give up ourselves to a bullshit system. Don't buy things, don't endorse things, be honest. It's lala land stuff, but 1984 is here, and we gotta work together. Soon enough there will be thought crime, and we'll all be criminals ",a3brhl,self.Conservative,,True

SC has a chance to rule on a case limit the powers of government agencies,Conservative," Just a caveat here, even the National Review author (David French) warns up front that this is boring. From Neil Gorsuch on 10th Circuit Court of Appeals: Transferring the job of saying what the law is from the judiciary to the executive unsurprisingly invites the very sort of due process (fair notice) and equal protection concerns the framers knew would arise if the political branches intruded on judicial functions. Under *Chevron*the people aren’t just charged with awareness of and the duty to conform their conduct to the fairest reading of the law that a detached magistrate can muster. Instead, they are charged with an awareness of *Chevron*; required to guess whether the statute will be declared “ambiguous” (courts often disagree on what qualifies); and required to guess (again) whether an agency’s interpretation will be deemed “reasonable.” Who can even attempt all that, at least without an army of perfumed lawyers and lobbyists? And, of course, that’s not the end of it. Even if the people somehow manage to make it through this far unscathed, they must always remain alert to the possibility that the agency will reverse its current view 180 degrees anytime based merely on the shift of political winds and still prevail. Basically his position is that these agencies can't just make it up as they go along ... which was a big thing under Obama.",a5cl2s,self.Conservative,,True

How the Media Pushes the Narrative,Conservative,"It seems that every program on ABC/NBC/CBS etc. must include certain plot items: 1) LGBTQ character with extra points if they just came out. 2) Female law enforcement officer/FBI-CIA/boss who's fighting being marginalized by men with extra points if she's a victim of sexual assault. 3) Illegal immigrant who only came here for a better life - extra points for being LGBTQ &/or a victim of sexual assault. Classic example was over a couple of recent episodes of 'Bull' (spoiler alert); Key female character is a former FBI agent. She's dating a guy who we presume to be Mexican? Latin? who works as a building superintendent. While the couple is out to dinner another patron of the restaurant collapses. Without thinking the boyfriend rushs over and begins medical treament but as the stricken patron stablizes and the siren is heard in the background, boyfriend informs the former FBI agent that they need to leave ASAP. Jump to the next episode where we discover that boyfriend is actually an undocumented immigrant and the story gets the wings needed to sway the court of public opinion. 1) He was a famous heart surgeon in the country he fled - the country is never named. 2) According to him the educated in his country are a threat to their government and his best friend from medical school was assassinated in a public square! in front of his wife and kids! 3) Knowing he had to get out he paid an attorney 'all his money' on the promise that he'd be accepted in the U.S. and be back practicing medicine in no time. Unfortunatley the lawyer duped him and all he got was a two week tourist visa. 4) After living in the U.S. under the radar for seven years, he's been caught and is facing deportation and certain death. And on we go from there with more stereotypes - the overburdened, uncaring (and clearly Trump-appointed judge); the former FBI agent/girlfriend forced by the cruel judge to admit Dr. Boyfriend committed a crime and a daring rescue to ship Dr. Boyfriend to Germany where he'll seek asylum(because we know how well that's working out for Germany). All overlaid with repeated references of what a quality person Dr. Boyfriend is and what he brings to the table. But here are a few questions that will never get asked or answered and the ommission of such which contributes to the average low-info voter buying the Democrat open borders line: 1) You came here on a tourist visa - what stopped you from seeking asylum during those two weeks? Why didn't you go to the U.S. Embassy in your home country and ask for asylum? 2) You've been here seven years - what exactly have you been bringing to the table as an under the table building super? In NYC - an all blue 'sanctuary city' with free legal aid and numerous resources, you couldn't go legit? &#x200B;",a41rro,self.Conservative,,True

REQUEST:. A concerted group effort to debunk the Washington post list of '3000 trump lies',Conservative, The Washington post has a list of supposed trump lies This list exceeds 3000 wich allows leftwing media to claim trump lies abnormally (he doesnt) if you take a brief look at their website you can see that the majority of what they claim our lies are not actually lies. Like Trump stating that the stock market is booming and that if he were to lose in the midterms it might not continue that way. Or the statement from trump: “CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the 'Media is the Enemy of the People.' Wrong! I said that the 'Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People.' a very big difference. When you give out false information - not good!” Wapo claims that TRUMP is lying. by warping what he said in claiming that when he says fake news he means all news. I don't believe he does. But really that's just a subjective opinion. Not a fact. If you were to look at the fact Trump would be absolutely correct that the media dropped off the word fake and and the fact Checker is full of things like that. Where they just don't like something Trump said I realize it might be too much. But I think it would be really good if somebody or some organization where to fact-check The Washington Post. To go through every one of their claims and find out if it was actually a liar or not. Hold their feet to the fire. And I think that the results would be pretty interesting As a second project it could also be doable to go through all of Obama's false claims and (like the wapo) count how many times he made those claims as an additional I. For example if he makes the same lie twice that's two lies. I guarantee that Obama's lies would come very close if not exceeding trumps fact of the matter is that Trump probably embellishes things a bit more than he actually outright lies. That's not to say he hasn't lied. But it would be very useful for somebody (hopefully us) To fact-check The Washington Post claims and publish them. Lets do this! I started!  ,a3rtrs,self.Conservative,,True

Aussie schools teaching to the left,Conservative,"TLDR at the bottom. Hey everyone I’m not 100% sure if this is the right place to post this but I just finished my second last year of high school (in Australia) and I’ve noticed over the years that there is little to no political education in our school system (at least in Victoria). Most people I talk to wouldn’t even be able to tell you the difference between socialist and conservative, capitalist and socialist ect. But if you ask them about policy they will seemingly always take the side of the left. I think this is mainly due to two factors. First the lack of political education in our schools coupled with the fact that, (in my experience) there are far more teachers that lean left than right in our schools, and they seem to be more vocal on issues. And second that one of the most popular news media in Australia called the project is VERY biased and constantly shoves there clearly left leaning opinions onto everyone, for example they recently had Dana white on and went hard trying to make him out as a bad guy who wants more and more drama in the UFC scene. And whenever trump is mentioned they will make a barrage of jokes and only ever show when he says something offensive or does something stupid. It just feels like so many people my age are just accepting liberal and socialist policies as being so great because they’re “fair” but don’t have any idea of how they could affect the economy (actually very little economics seems to be taught too), for example if you said something about American policy someone would say “yeah but they don’t even have healthcare” which really annoys me because they clearly don’t understand how much healthcare costs or anything about the economic side really. TLDR: it feels like most people my age in aus are sitting on the left without any understanding of what that means or any economics background, school seems to avoid politics. Anyway do any of you in other countries experience this or anyone from Australia seen this or maybe seen the opposite? Thanks.",a29cx0,self.Conservative,,True

Which company is more tolerant towards conservatives and conservatism: Apple or Google?,Conservative,"I'm thinking of getting a new smartphone: either an Apple iPhone XS Max (Apple's iOS) or a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Google's Android). With this smartphone change, I wish to support a company which stands for my values, or at least stands for them more than the competition. (The major tech giants are situated in Democratic California, so I would have to be less picky and choose the lesser of the two evils.) &#x200B; Initially, I was thinking of getting an iPhone XS Max. Several Internet sources have mentioned that Apple values customers' privacy more than Google, Samsung, and Apple's other competitors. Apple also boasts about being more pro-environment. Several Internet sources also mention that Apple products, especially more expensive ones, are more durable \ \]. Cook is also reported to have stated 'Choosing to set (the responsibility of separating right and wrong) aside at a moment of trial is a sin'. &#x200B; I understand that if I really wish to get a new smartphone, I would have to choose the lesser of the two evils in this case. &#x200B; Which company is more tolerant towards conservatives and conservatism: Apple or Google?

Punching Left,Conservative,"Drunk from Trump hate, Liberals are beginning to sound more and more like Republicans every day. I don't mean blue collar Republicans, or populists; I mean the Country Club, Halliburton types Trump has finally enlightened (peer pressured?) us into shirking. The ideological RINO deadweight has (ostensibly) fallen off. I can't be the only one who has noticed there is no real left wing in America. I understand we have a few ANTIFA nerds running amok, but how many of them have read any Marx? How many of them are ready to act for society according to their ability, and take only what they need? So who is out there representing the interests of the working class? Bernie Sanders? Alexandria Ocasio Cortez? Is Beto O'Rourke going to hop on a skateboard and dab his way to the Presidency after Trump flees to Russia? Give me a damn break. For once we have a President who is ending American Imperialism, protecting consumers, getting our bum-ass allies to contribute to the post-War World Order, rebuilding our infrastructure, and seriously trying to get manufacturing jobs back here in the United States. And liberals are freaking out. They like war now. Putin probably told him to leave Syria! They don't want manufacturing jobs here. Who wants to pay a million dollars for an iPhone? In 2018 we have the 'left' in America rooting for the perpetuation of the international corporatist model which exploits brown people just so we can continue to buy cheap bullshit. The other day I was in a grocery store and I saw a plastic wine glass for sale. It was made in China. Are you telling me the United States can't even make a fucking plastic wine glass? Nobody did anything to bring manufacturing jobs back until Trump. Now, I realize that's because nobody cared to. It was just a poker chip. A poker chip thrown around by liars in the Democratic Party while Democrats continue to govern the way everyone said Republicans did -- perpetuating war, screwing the working class, and selling out to corporate interests. Any working class hero would recognize the good Trump is doing. (And a working class hero is something to be.) 50 years of being ruled by RINOs and Neoliberals has given us the following: Environmental Destruction. International Debt. Genocide. 'Entangling Alliances' And... (fanfare) The greatest gap between the rich and the poor to ever exist. Trump is saying what conservative leaders should've been saying for years. We're living in a strip mall. The architecture here reminds me of East Germany -- but there won't be a revolt, because the Democrats are giving us token Latinos or token Women, to keep the working class pacified. And the wedge issues. My God. Is banning 'Baby it's Cold Outside' the hill you want to die on? Just come to the Trump side. Trump's getting shit done. War is Over.

My journey from Communist to Conservative,Conservative,"For context I am from the UK and I know a lot of content here is from the US. Two years ago I’d turned eighteen, a year ago voted in my first general election. Two years ago I was a far leaning lefty, I grew up in relative poverty so perhaps I blamed the conservatives unwarrantably. I won’t go into my views on everything but one thing I’ve always loved is a healthy debate. I never forced my view onto people I simply debated from my point of view. I voted remain in the Brexit referendum thinking that leaving would destroy us. How my opinion has changed. Upon taking Politics at University, I’ve slowly become a conservative. When I debate with people my age or even older I’ve slowly seen leftist propaganda spewing, especially from the education system. One of my fellow students argued on controlled immigration and was labelled a racist and when I defended that he had a point of view and was rightly angry at illegal immigration I was labelled a racist. I’ve come to realise that the left are simply name callers and the backwards ones. I have also become a leave voter realising what a corrupt system the European Union is. What I find more insulting, despite having been a remain voter, is that people who voted leave are being named people who were misinformed or didn’t realise what they were voting for. I’ve come to realise that capitalism, having its faults like many system, has allowed me to venture into further education (first person in my family to go to university) and I’ve worked for a year and a half and earned a considerable income. Simply wanted to say how disgusted I am at the lefts name calling, undemocratic values, propaganda and having a centralised government is simply taking power away from workers and the people.",a5z0fv,self.Conservative,,True

And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this [shall be] a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.** **That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.**",a7am7b,self.Conservative,,True

Blank Slate - Staff on Strike,Conservative," Slate staff voted 52-1 to go on strike for more money, more union rights, and ... yes ... more diversity on the staff. So going for the low hanging fruit here, does that mean that they want Slate to fire some of them to hire more 'oppressed' people? But this story just reminded me of how ignorant 'workers' can be, completely unconcerned with the larger marketplace and their viability within. The online journal business is a tough one and any new expenses are going to mean more advertising or paywalls - meaning the loss of readership, and a declining influence. Slate management possibly believed that people working together for the right cause would keep staff happy, in fact studies do show that people prefer meaningful work over more pay. But, why not have both, eh! Management is in a bind, revealing themselves to be nothing short of capitalist exploiters if they fail to capitulate. But if the staff is anything like the articles I've seen on Slate, this is just the beginning of an endless stream of demands. Maybe ultimately management will have to make labor the owners, and if that happens it's likely the business will descend into the abyss as all the equal partners argue over every little issue.",a5b0lm,self.Conservative,,True

#MeToo goes too far. Radical feminism infiltrates judicial system. Male professor loses career after spurning female stalker who retaliated with false harassment claim. Female High Court judge rules that stalker’s exposure is not sexual harassment and that her defamation was not unacceptable.,Conservative,"A happily-married father and award-winning professor at the London School of Economics - whose ground-breaking research long-predicted trends including the global financial crisis, Brexit, Trump and #MeToo - was stalked and sexually harassed by an obsessive and unstable American postgraduate student and teaching assistant (TA), who exposed herself to him in a research meeting. The professor spurned the TA’s unwanted advances, terminated her employment with him and filed a sexual harassment grievance against her. In spite of corroborating independent eyewitness evidence, as well as evidence in which the TA admitted her sexual misconduct on social media, the LSE refused to investigate the professor’s grievance and initiated a university-wide cover-up. ​ The TA inverted the sexual harassment story to her mother in the US who then initiated a false grievance against the innocent professor, without her daughter’s knowledge and against her wishes. The TA therefore felt she had no choice but to follow through with the false and malicious allegations and she launched an international defamation campaign against the innocent academic. The professor was immediately presumed to be guilty by the LSE prior to any investigation, punished publicly, led to believe that he had been accused of rape, and harassed and bullied into a career-ending illness. ​ The TA’s false and malicious allegations were eventually determined by the LSE to be not proven and the 30-year-old woman has since left the country and changed her name. The LSE’s Director was forced to write a formal apology letter to the professor before stepping down as the highest-paid Director in the history of the LSE. Multiple senior LSE officials involved with this case have since left the LSE. The professor has refused to accept the LSE’s multiple increasing offers to settle out-of-court and he filed two separate multi-million pound lawsuits against the LSE for the loss of his career, which are believed to be the largest lawsuits of their kind in the history of Higher Education. The professor, whose lectures on his ground-breaking research commanded over $10,000 per hour, intends that the majority of any damages awarded would go to charity and he simply wants to do his small part to ensure that such unethical behaviour does not harm other innocent victims (whether female or male) in the future. Former UK Lord Chief Justice Woolf, who famously conducted a high-level inquiry into unethical practices at the LSE, condemned the LSE for lacking a culture of ethics. The professor’s landmark High Court trial was the first test (and gross failure) of Lord Woolf’s ethics recommendations at the LSE. ​ The UK High Court recently found the LSE to be in multiple breaches of duty of care and breach of contract which is an important finding for the professor's upcoming multi-million pound discrimination and unfair dismissal lawsuit in the Employment Tribunal. In addition, a High Court appeal has also been filed which challenges the Judge's findings that it is not considered sexual harassment when a woman exposes herself in the workplace, and that the stalker's dissemination of unproven, career-ending accusations against an innocent male is not considered “oppressive and unacceptable” behaviour which would result in a foreseeable illness. &#x200B; One media source on this under-reported scandal can be found at:  &#x200B; &#x200B;",a9qbmz,self.Conservative,,True

Petition: worldnews should not be a default sub,Conservative, World news has been a default sub for sometime. Amamassing hundreds of thousands if not millions of viewers as a default service should be required to hold some responsibility. Including allowing all of reddit's communities to participate. And not just people that hold the political ideology they agree with Because their posts are seen by millions of people. And they're directly promoted by Reddit Itself by being a default sub therefore the political censorship on that subreddit should not be tolerated. Banning users simply for expressing hey different political ideology should not be tolerated there are countless examples of that subreddit Banning people for saying exactly the same thing that I liberal said but from a conservative stance. The same kinds of insults. Of the same kinds of arguments. There are people who are band simply for using fact to discredit a liberal narrative. the moderators of that 7 gauge in censorship to curate their subreddit to a specific political ideology. But they are then rewarded by being a default subreddit for every new person who joins the site and being on all where everybody can see it. If the Donald is going to be banned from all for that then they should As far as subreddits go they have every right to curate their subreddit as they want. Unless people want read it to change its rules. But if you're going to do that then they should not be a default subreddit. They should not be allowed to have every new user automatically subscribed to them and their propaganda if they are default subreddit they should be required to follow a strict set of rules about moderation. If they don't want to follow those rules than they should be removed as a default subreddit. I think these proposals are perfectly reasonable. Since Reddit is a site to get tens of millions of Paige clicks per month. It has a mass effect on elections. It's not just a site So I proposed this petition to remove world news as a default subreddit ,a4cap5,self.Conservative,,True

'The wall is being built' So proud of our President right now.,Conservative,"I just watched him completely wipe the table with Pelosi and Schumer. They kept trying to steer the conversation away and make him look bad but he stood his ground. He managed to keep steering the conversation back to whats important: **Border Security** and **The Wall**. >One thing that I do have to say is: Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of -- a lot of wall. When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we’ve renovated a tremendous amount and we’ve done a lot of work. In San Diego, we’re building new walls right now. And we’ve -- right next to San Diego, we’ve completed a major section of wall and it’s really worked well. >So, a lot of wall has been built. We don’t talk about that, but we might as well start, because it’s building -- it’s being built right now, big sections of wall. And we will continue that. >And one way or the other, it’s going to get built. I’d like not to see a government closing, a shutdown. We will see what happens over the next short period of time. But the wall is a very important thing to us. >I might put it a different way. Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security. When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of -- we shut it down; we had no choice. We shut it down. But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security. >I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers. They’ve been incredible. The ICE agents and officers, they’ve been incredible. And very importantly, our military. Our military went in and they did an incredible job. They have been really, really spectacular. >A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in -- they were going to come in even in a rough way -- many of these people are leaving now and they’re going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries. They’re leaving. If you noticed, it’s getting a lot less crowded in Mexico. And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well. So we appreciate that. But they haven’t been coming into our country. We can’t let people come in that way. >So that’s pretty much it. We’re going to talk about the wall. I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is. I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is. And I want to talk about the wall. And I will tell you, it’s a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of -- I really think I can say “border security,” but certainly the wall. >But the wall will get built. A lot of the wall is built. It’s been very effective. I asked for a couple of notes on that. If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up. El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up. >In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent. Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent. >I mean -- and when I say “dropped,” the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren’t built. It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is. So, I mean, it’s very effective. >If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel -- 99.9 percent effective. And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better. >So we’ve done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built. A lot of people don’t know that. A lot of wall is renovated. We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape. And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military. Our military has done a fantastic job. So the wall will get built, but we may not -- we may not have an agreement today. We probably won’t. But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.

Do you think Conservativism has changed over the last 20 years?,Conservative,Son in a family of life long Republicans. Some members of my family say that the party has changed over the past 20 years. I would say that changing priorities and evolving with the times would be natural for any political party. But I am not old enough to have any real context. Do you feel that being Conservative now means something different than being Conservative 20 years ago. Big question I know. Lots of topics to think about. Any perspective that you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.,a5wk7e,self.Conservative,,True
OPEN LETTER TO SENATOR HARRIS (D-CA),Conservative,"I attempted to upload this letter to Senator Harris’ official website but was kicked off and my letter deleted. So now it is to become an open letter. I have deleted links and phone numbers in order to bypass any filters. I have also deleted my last name and will use Edward in its stead. The Senator's auto-response letter, to which I respond, is included below. Edward Semper Fidelis &#x200B; OPEN LETTER TO SENATOR HARRIS (D-CA) November 29, 2018 Senator Kamala Harris (via website) Dear Senator Harris, This letter is in reply to your October 16, 2018, response to my criticisms of your comportment during the Justice Kavanaugh hearings. I did not address you as Kamala in my initial correspondence; I addressed you as Senator Harris so as a Constituent (don't forget you work for me, we, the people of California) I would appreciate the courtesy in return: please address me as Mr. Edward in any future correspondence to me or about me. I thank you in advance. With all due respect to the office of Senator of the United States, YOU are a liar, madam. I watched the hearings with my own two eyes. I listened to the hearings with my own two ears. At no time did then-United States Circuit Judge Kavanaugh disrespect you or your colleagues. Quite the contrary, Senator Harris, the disrespect I witnessed was perpetrated by you and your Democrat colleagues, i.e., bushwacking Justice Kavanaugh at the eleventh hour with unverified, uncorroborated and even spurious accusations that Senator Feinstein kept hidden from the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee; besmirching Justice Kavanaugh's stellar name, his achievements and his family as well. There were no witnesses to back up these 'credible allegations' as you call them; in fact, the witnesses Dr. Blasey-Ford put forth to verify her wild allegation, swearing under penalty of perjury, denied any knowledge of the alleged event. Have you forgotten the fact that Dr. Blasey-Ford's best friend at the time denied ever knowing Brett Kavanaugh? No, you haven't forgotten that little tidbit; it is my contention that you just choose to ignore the facts to achieve your own agenda. Lying is not becoming of a Senator of the United States, Senator Harris. Continuing, Senator Harris, by your own standards you need to 'ask for an FBI investigation' into your own conduct regarding the ethics complaint filed against you for violating fundraising rules - trying to make a buck off of the Kavanaugh hearings; trying to make a buck off of the misery you caused this fine man and his family, is quite reprehensible. Or, perhaps, again by your own stated standards, you need to 'ask for an FBI investigation' into yourself regarding the allegations of you conspiring with Congresswoman Maxine Waters to circumvent Federal Election Commission rules/laws regarding the slate mailers. As a Constituent, I demand you 'ask for an FBI investigation' into yourself regarding these two crimes and anything else the FBI may find along the way that you have done illegally, immorally, or have ever been accused of, whether or not these crimes you committed are verified/unverified or corroborated/uncorroborated. Obviously you are guilty, Senator Harris, again by your own standards. After all, we do expect our elected officials to be fair, at the very least, wouldn't you agree? And by the way, aren't you an attorney who swore an oath of integrity to a blind lady holding a set of scales? And please correct me if I am mistaken, but do not Senators of the United States take an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States as well? Blatant hypocrisy is not becoming of a United States Senator, Senator Harris. With my own eyes and ears, I witnessed no 'misleading of the Senate' by Justice Kavanaugh. The only misleading (and disrespect) of everyone I witnessed was perpetrated by Senator Feinstein, you, Senator Harris, and your Democrat colleagues in the Judiciary Committee by keeping the unverified and uncorroborated allegations against Justice Kavanaugh sub rosa until the eleventh hour. In fact, I would go so far as to label this subterfuge by you and your fellow Democrats as 'obstruction of justice.' So your allegation of Justice Kavanaugh 'misleading the Senate' is another lie. Once again, by your very own stated standards, you need to 'ask the FBI for an investigation' into yourself, Senator Feinstein and the Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee for obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice, conspiracy to withhold material evidence, and withholding material evidence from the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, even though that material evidence was unverified and uncorroborated. Hopefully, there is already an investigation by the FBI underway regarding your comportment, as well as that of Senator Feinstein and the other Democrat members of the Committee. Lying and misleading the American People and the Judiciary Committee are unbecoming traits of a United States Senator, Senator Harris. Oh, perhaps I have already said that. '. . . accusing the women of being part of a leftwing conspiracy.' Amazingly, you ask me to believe this twisted truth from you, Senator Harris? Not until after the fiasco you and your colleagues created was almost at an end and Justice Kavanaugh was allowed to respond to the unverified and uncorroborated allegations made against him, as well your unforgivable treatment of him, did he release his anger at the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and stated his opinion that the whole charade was a 'leftwing conspiracy.' In my opinion Justice Kavanaugh stated the truth, Senator Harris. You can deny all you want, but it was plain as day. I do not blame Justice Kavanaugh for being angry - the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee did conspire against him and certainly treated him unfairly and maliciously. Just look at yourself and your colleagues on a replay of the hearings. If it were me I would be very angry too if the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee tried to frame me; and if you are honest with yourself, you would admit that you would have been angry as well. Hypocrisy is unbecoming a United States Senator, Senator Harris. I am beginning to see a pattern here, Senator Harris, of lies, twisted truths and hypocrisy on your part. Your response to my criticisms of your comportment in conjunction with the Kavanaugh hearing is unacceptable as you did not address my complaint, which was how you conducted yourself! What was your reasoning behind your conduct? Why did you think it was okay to beat the man down? I expect you, Senator Harris, as a United States Senator representing California to 'adhere to our highest ethical standards,' and to comport yourself, along with your Democrat colleagues, with a modicum of decorum, instead of acting like a mob of angry children. 'Adhere to our highest ethical standards.' Do you recognize these words, Senator Harris? They are yours. But let me be clear, Senator Harris, Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States was a great achievement for the United States. Also let me make it very clear that I do expect you to conduct yourself with the 'highest ethical standards' and “ensure our federal judiciary provides equal justice under law” while representing your constituents in the once-Great State of California. As it stands now, Senator, you do not have my vote. Is that clear enough for you? I feel it imperative that you be reminded once again, so that it is crystal clear to you, that you do work for me, Senator Harris, and the other legal residents (your Constituents) of California. We did not send you to Washington to feed your own agenda or to attack those you perceive are your ideological enemies. You work for us and not the Democrat Party. Do you think it would serve you well to remember that, Senator Harris? Finally, you embarrassed me, as a citizen and resident of California, with the disgusting behavior you demonstrated at the Kavanaugh hearing, Senator Harris. You and your Democrat colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have cast a cloud of shame and disgust upon yourselves, individually, and the Democrat Party as a whole. This is not the first public display of your vitriol, disrespect and bias towards those who do not agree with your ideologies, just so you can 'score some points' that may or may not assist you in your quest for the Democrat nomination to run for President of the United States. Have you no conscience? Have you no shame? Clean it up, Senator! Very sincerely, Edward Edward Semper Fidelis cc: Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh (via website); Senator Grassley (Judiciary Committee (via website), Tom Fitton (Judicial Watch), Larry Klayman (Freedom Watch); Fox News (via website); various other internet entities \*\*\*\*\* On Tue, Oct 16, 2018 at 9:41 AM U.S. Senator Kamala Harris >wrote: October 16, 2018 Dear Edward, Thank you for contacting me about Justice Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court. I voted against Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Several women came forward with serious, credible allegations of sexual misconduct against Justice Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh responded to those allegations by refusing to ask for an FBI investigation, misleading the Senate, disrespecting my colleagues, and accusing the women of being part of a leftwing conspiracy. I feared that, if he were confirmed, the Affordable Care Act would be gutted, rules protecting workers and the environment would fall, women’s access to abortion would be severely limited, and common sense gun safety laws would become impossible. Supreme Court justices must be steadfastly independent, adhere to our highest ethical standards, and exhibit judicial temperament. In light of his record and partisan testimony before the Committee, it is clear Justice Kavanaugh directly threatens those principles. But let me be clear: Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation is only a setback on the path towards progress, not the end of the road. I will do everything in my power to ensure our federal judiciary provides equal justice under law and to fight for your rights and the rights of all Americans. Together, I know we will fulfill our nation’s promise to provide equality, dignity, and justice for all. Thank you again for contacting me about this crucial matter. If you have additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202). Sincerely, Kamala D. Harris United States Senator",a26ak7,self.Conservative,,True

Are California's wildfires related to unwillingness to cut timber?,Conservative,"There is a pretty clear chain of reasoning behind this idea but I don't have anything else to substantiate it at the moment. This is an idle thought I had a week or three ago and just now decided to take the plunge and post about it. I decided to post here because willingness to manage natural resources is a more Conservative idea whereas blind faith in nature to take care of itself is a more Liberal idea at least as far as I can tell. So that chain of reasoning goes like this: the people who tend to live in and/or run the state of California might not be the types who encourage timber harvesting. If in any given wooded area timber is not harvested over a long period of time deadwood builds up and provides potential forest fire conditions. California has been ravaged by wildfires. I think these premises are fairly solid but is there a causal relationship? I wish I had the time to actually find data to establish the connection but I do not. I am posting the idea here in case it resonates with someone who does. However, I am also posting the idea here in hopes that if my reasoning is not sound or any of my assumptions are incorrect I might be gently corrected and therefore become wiser to the world.",a2qhqm,self.Conservative,,True

The Democrats will never sign in DACA for a border wall,Conservative,"Why might you ask? Simple. They stand too much to gain from the fear of dreamers being deported. And if they did sign it in, it would be a big victory for Trump. They want to continue dependence immigration (Immigrants who are dependent on the power of the Democrats to keep their way of life) as long as possible to change demographics as a means to consolidate power. They have already done this in California. Edit: There needs to be a term for this political strategy to properly show citizens the deceitful nature of it.

A Question Regarding Social Security,Conservative,"I’m failing to understand the core of what social security is. Politically, I want government out of things as much as possible. When looking at social security I truly don’t understand why government is involved. My thinking boils down to one question: Why is the government taking money from me and telling me when to use my money? From my perspective this seems to rid a person of financial responsibility and replaces it with government reliance. Could a person not just invest in a 10 or 30 year treasury bond or put that money in their savings? Why must I take my hard earned money and put it in the hands of the government? The only way I can understand why they are taking money from me is not because this is an investment of my money but rather a way for my money to be used on other people. Now I understand that the goal of social security is one of humanitarianism. We all agree that the sick and elderly shouldn’t have to suffer financially. The disagreement is the means used to achieve that goal. Once again, I’m not trying to act like I understand social security. I’m 19 and I don’t have a job. The thing is that I fail to understand SS even when I’m not having money taken from me. This is a serious question and I hope that I don’t offend anyone. I hope people understand that this question isn’t born out of ill will or intent but rather curiosity and interest. I also hope that I’m not viewed as heartless. Freedom for an individual is the most important thing for me. As one of my favorite economists, Milton Friedman said, “A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.”",a28crn,self.Conservative,,True

"Illegals, The Wall, and why none of this matters.",Conservative,"Think about all the divisive arguments you've seen or had about immigration. Everyone on the left is focused on the cruelty of it's enforcement, desperate people, emotional arguments. Everyone on the right is focused on supply side solutions that are difficult or impossible to actually realize, like making our enormous southern border impenetrable or scaring them away or finding them all and kicking them out. I want to make the argument that there is no will in either party to stop illegal immigration. This focus on supply side solutions like the wall is basically one big bamboozle on people that might have valid reasons to want to stop illegal immigration. It should be obvious that hiring illegals in America is big business. They work at the largest factory farms, they do landscape work, they work in restaurant kitchens, they are involved in all sorts of skilled and unskilled blue collar trade. The sectors of the economy employing illegals are so large that it should be obvious they donate to both parties. It should be obvious that some abrubt stop to illegal immigration would be disastrous for the economy short term. This is why we see this focus on supply side solutions. Big business knows a wall isn't going to stop the workers, they know a little increased enforcement is only going to make it harder for them to come over which makes hem a little more captive of an employee to get here. Big business use illegals to depress wages, they use them because they definitely can't unionize, they use them because they have a better work ethic, they use them because they can't sue or complain. It's a captive workforce, paying off the debt they owe to the people that smuggled them in. The real solution to this would pay for itself. Aggressively investigate and fine anybody that hires illegals. Isn't it suspicious that a demand based solution seems off the table, not even thought about? We arrest drug users, but not the people that profit from illegal immigration? That's cause it's a charade, political theater. Money wants cheap labor and neither party cares about how that affects you. Anyway, thanks for your time. I am curious what you guys think. I personally think we should find some way to end illegal immigration. I just think the wall is a pork project and all the supply side solutions are just a show for votes.",a6bu3v,self.Conservative,,True

"Did Bill Nye Ever respond to the Criticism After his Netflix show, 'Bill Nye Saves the World'?",Conservative,"Hi fellas, I'm sure you all remember when Bill Nye shilled for the Anti-science propaganda of the Left and LGBT communities and claimed talked about the, 'gender spectrum,' which is the left's explanation of how their 96 million genders and counting fit into Biology. Everyone knows it's bullshit and Nye has lost all credibility and respect. However that's not what I came to ask. I remember in the aftermath of the backlash against his show I remember searching for his response to the backlash and if he responded at all after everything happened and couldn't find any. This was only a few weeks after it all took place so I figured it'll take some time. I remember waiting and then i forgot about it and moved on, much like his fans did to him. Now it's been around a year since all that shit happened and I'm wondering did he ever respond to the Criticism or talk about the episode of that show? Did he ever even acknowledge that it happened? Did he say anything at all about what happened, why it happened or why he did it? I'm basically looking for if he acknowledged the whole debacle at all, if I recall correctly he does have a Twitter and he didn't say a word right? Can someone help me out here? Thanks in advance.",a29boe,self.Conservative,,True
Youtube BS,Conservative,"After watching the youtube CEO congressional hearing, coupled with the patreon bias, I decided to search for liberal left leaning videos on youtube.

However, the conservative videos had 3-5 ads EACH. Im not counting the opening ad when you click on a video, this is specifically ads during the video. This is anecdotal, obviously, but how is this not biased in some form or fashion. No one wants the ads, they are annoying AF, especially when you can't skip. Are they trying to drive me crazy?

How can WE fix the current problem in our country? [serious],Conservative,"Former moderate, now more conservative checking in. I dislike the fact that I consider myself conservative instead of moderate these days, because I am a supporter of various social issues that fall outside of typical conservative values (welfare and abortion for instance). I have been pushed to the right as a result of the ridiculous amount of aggression from the left solely on the merits of my skin color, sex, gender preference, and political leaning. That being said, I fundamentally believe that for us to have the best society that we can have we need to reach a middle ground where people who have differing values can both be beneficiaries of society and live in harmony. Visiting subreddits like r/politics, I see an overwhelming amount of craziness and hate from left leaning folks and the dismissal of any kind of right leaning thought. I don't see that here. I see mostly rationality here, despite the occasional conservative craziness. Being a Republican in 2018, for instance, I can have 100 conversations with a conservative and maybe 5% will trash talk liberals. Being from the DC area and seeing r/politics, I know and have experienced that having 100 conversations with a liberal will end up in 90% trash talking of conservatives. I get it that Trump is president and we are all instantly racists and deplorable, but rather than us reveling in the craziness of the left, can we start to think about how we can bridge the gap and be less divisive? I guess my question is, given all of this, as conservatives what can we do to engage in meaningful civil discourse that can bring us together? We are all part of the problem, left or right, but we need to get somewhere in which we can talk and come to consensus rather than this constant babble. Thoughts?",a618yg,self.Conservative,,True

He said a proud blue state fact, Washington state was the first state and allow women to vote in 1883. I didnt reply then because I hadn't done research yet. I now have, history lesson: Arthur Denny (a conservative) pushed to allow white woman over the age of 18 to vote in the Territorial Congress in 1854 originally. The vote was 8 to 9. Then in 1883 they allowed women suffrage, during Republicans being the majority in the state at the time mind you. Also because of the protests by Susan B. Anthony a Conservative Republican. Not to mention the 19th Ammendment was drafted by a conservative Republican. And guess who opposed it. The Democrat controlled Senate, 4 times it was opposed. TL:DR. It was a Red state when it gave women the right to vote.",a7ouo9,self.Conservative,,True
I don't think I'm ever voting Democrat again.,Conservative," Even if they dropped all the identity politics, I still doubt that *more* government is the solution. But, let's say they convinced me of that. And that a singular Dem politician was deemed trustable and 'from the people', let's say Octavio-Cortez. How would I know that it wasn't just the biased newspapers lying once again? I think the only way I'd trust a Democrat after everything I've seen is if Breitbart or someone gave examples that they 'weren't that bad.' Because we know BB would never go full on Democrat. Or, maybe if the MSM disparaged them the way Fox did Trump during the primary and some of the election. ",a53jhm,self.Conservative,,True

White Privilege,Conservative,"I've been a conservative for long time, and I've always been able to debate most liberals pretty well in most of the current hot topics.

Especially when compared to the Jacob Anderson sexual assault case, where he only got probation. How do you argue against such a thing as white privilege given this information? note: Please don't destroy me too bad, would just like someone to explain the error of my ways.",a68pky,self.Conservative,,True

Framing political opinions to be more palatable for liberals,Conservative,"You need to use morality to effectively communicate your point. You want lower taxes - you may want to lower taxes for all individuals and businesses, but saying you want more money doesn’t sit well with most. Sure it is reasonable and respectful position to you put not them. Instead of saying you want more money directly, you can say that you want more money to be in the hands of small businesses so communities can grow. Your emotional intentions are important to them. You have to recognize this. With gun control, it is not reasonable to expect them to find agreement on something they know so little about (they want less of them, why would they ever learn anything about them in the first place?). Instead, point out the people and communities the laws affect. Show the gun control policies as a hinderance to the safety and representation to the most marginalized people and communities. Not as an unreasonable law that says you can’t buy a certain kind of your toy or tool for no good reason. When wanting less illegal immigration or immigration in general, don’t dwell on the negative aspects that come with illegal or legal immigrants. Instead show that larger influxes of immigrants take up state and federal resources that could be used for the millions of citizens that need these resources as well. Framing issues in the way that appeals to them is effective for explaining your positions and opinions to someone not likely to be sympathetic. If you do not do this, you will appear distant, cold, and evil to them.",a464vy,self.Conservative,,True

To me, this very closely corresponds to everything I've been hearing come out of our college campuses. For example: 'Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of the State, which stands for the conscience and the universal, will of man as a historic entity' 'Grouped according to their several interests, individuals form classes; they form trade-unions when organized according to their several economic activities; but first and foremost they form the State, which is no mere matter of numbers, the suns of the individuals forming the majority.'  This isn't a complete copy but one can be downloaded from Southern Methodist with a quick search. I'm still reading through this document and noticing other similarities to policies the Democratic Socialist side of the Democratic party are pushing. I'm interested in hearing what others think of this.",a6lqhd,self.Conservative,,True
Watching 'The Lost Tapes' about Clinton impeachment reveals the power of the media,Conservative,"Bill Clinton was accused by women of being a serial sexual assaulter. Bill Clinton had a sexual affair with Gennifer Flowes for years while married to HRC. Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship with a young female intern and penetrated her with a cigar. The media portrayed his accusers and lovers as liars and opportunists. They even portrayed a 21 year old Monica Lewinsky as a seductress who lured Clinton into the affair by showing him the strings of her thong. Hillary Clinton, the great 'FEMINIST' is a woman married to a man who has repeatedly cheated on her and raped women. The media adore her. Bill Clinton is still revered by the media. When he dies---which looks like sooner than Carter from his gaunt appearance---the media's adulation for him will dwarf the Bush 41 funeral. He'll be praised as an economic genius. No mention will be made of his rapist tendencies. Donald Trump very likely cheated on his Slovenian model wife with a porn star and a Playboy Centerfold. And he's a billionaire. I just sort of figured that's what the life of a billionaire was like. I suspect most ultra-wealthy men, especially those in high profile cities like NYC had mistresses, and their wives accepted that as part of being the wife of a billionaire. I'm not saying it's right, but I don't see Melania Trump wrapping herself in the cloak of feminism, either. No, Melania is raising her son and performing traditional FLOTUS duties---kids, charities, etc. President Trump is going to be portrayed as a vile pervert horndog by the media, but Clinton is beloved.

Moral Dilemma: I'm a conservative millennial and most people I want to work with are openly liberal,Conservative,"Hey guys. I don't really see a lot of discussion type posts so I'm not sure if this is the place to put it, but I'm hoping for some input. Back story: I'm a business owner in a new niche who's just beginning to explore networking, partnerships, and other types of professional relationships. &#x200B; I need to do what I think/feel is right in order to sleep at night.. obviously. This also means not supporting people doing things I think is wrong. I'm having a moral dilemma, because I'm a creative business owner, which means lots of partnerships and relationships with other business owners. Great, relationships are one of my favorite parts of business. Not so great: many, many creative millennial business owners I potentially would and will work with are openly liberal (edit: in their business. People who use their business page or business persona to promote their liberal agenda) &#x200B; I want to be very clear here: I have NO PROBLEM with respectful differences in fundamental political beliefs. I DO have a problem with most of these people having uninformed opinions who believe the media's bullshit that conservatives are all evil selfish racists. I'm not a fan of people whose entire political views are based on what CNN is saying today. A close conservative friend of mine asks me if I really want to be intertwined with people like that. (I don't know? I mean, I guess not, but I really try to keep business and personal separate? But it's starting to feel like supporting openly liberal businesses and business owners is giving my money to something I really, really don't agree with.) &#x200B; It's so hard because my conservatism is rooted in hatred of the media manipulation.... a considerable distaste for abrasive people..... But these people are talented, and I feel I'm setting myself up for a shitty career if I actively try to avoid working with liberals. I mean, that's being as exclusionary as they are. Right? &#x200B; Anyway, I'm pretty new to politics, so this is a brand new dilemma for me. I'd really love to hear some thoughts from the more seasoned conservatives who have been in my position or currently are.

Is it bad that I can't have an opinion on Trump at the moment?,Conservative,"I'm a current high school senior right now. I was introduced to Trump like how a lot of people my age was, through memes and social commentary. As an educated political voice and very politically charged person, I loved to discuss or debate with classmates; I could grow my knowledge and either allow new ideas to permeate my worldview or block them off accordingly. For example, journalism, my favorite class, is where a lot of these discussions would happen, and the teacher (who leans slightly left, but that's okay☺️ he's the bomb) would often challenge my ideas, especially when I write political columns. Now, I was on board with a lot of the policies Trump promised. (I still am, but I'm not sure what's the same and what's different.) They seem fairly straightforward and efficient. But, ever since—I wanna say...—whenever the whole thing Mueller and the Russia scandal blew up (maybe springtime this year? I can't quite remember), I've had a hard time keeping up with the Trumpster. I'm not sure if it's the flood of names, the buzz words, or Reddit, but I've been out of the loop or behind by a few months on what the man has been doing or what has been done to the man. And, sadly, because I simply don't understand all these headlines, all these articles, all this discussion about Trump and the complex issues surrounding him, I can't have an opinion on him. This leads me to my question: is it bad that a 17-year-old Christian high-school conservative like myself doesn't know what's going on? If so, how so and how do you recommend that I go about edumacatin' myself? If not, why not? Thank you!",a4mzw3,self.Conservative,,True

6 Key Takeaways From The Comey Deposition Transcript,Conservative,"## 1. We didn’t learn much — but that was significant. Comey repeatedly responded to questions about the Trump campaign investigation by pleading ignorance, establishing he did not know of many of the facts underlying both the launch of Crossfire Hurricane and the continuing investigation. That’s concerning. For instance, in response to Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy’s characterization of Crossfire Hurricane as a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, Comey claimed that the FBI was not investigating Trump or the Trump campaign, but had instead “opened investigations on four Americans to see if there was any connection between those four Americans and the Russian interference effort. And those four Americans did not include the candidate.” Yet Comey had never seen the “FBI’s initiation document,” which Gowdy indicated referenced the “Trump campaign.” Further questioning revealed that Comey had no knowledge concerning the agent responsible for drafting the FBI’s late-July 2016 initiation document for Crossfire Hurricane, did not know who approved the draft of the “initial plan for the Russian investigation,” and never read or saw the initiation document. In fact, Comey said he didn’t even know how the FBI launches counterintelligence investigations, who has the authority to launch a counterintelligence investigation into a major political campaign, or whether such an investigation would need to be approved by the FBI Director. Comey did note that “there’s documentation in criminal investigations and in counterintelligence investigations to explain the predication for the opening of a file, that is, the basis for the opening of a file.” These exchanges raise three concerning points: First, that FBI agents — including the biased, “We’ll stop Trump from becoming president” duo of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page — had the ability, without Comey’s involvement, to launch an investigation into the Trump campaign. Second, Comey’s testimony shows that he may not have known the official basis for, and scope of, the probe because he never saw the “initiation document.” And third, the same agents who launched the investigation craft the documentation to explain “the basis for the opening of a file.” So, if the agents wanted to pin the launch of Crossfire Hurricane on George Papadopoulos’ supposed foreknowledge of the WikiLeak hack into DNC emails, they would merely need to list that as the predicate for opening the investigation. ## 2. Comey buys the George Papadopoulos pretext, But that’s because he doesn’t know the facts. Although Comey testified that he never saw the “initiation document” and had no idea who drafted or approved the initiation of the probe, he unequivocally stated that the Steele dossier did not prompt the Russia probe. When asked how he knew that, Comey said: >Because I know what the basis was for starting the investigation. It was the information we’d received about a conversation that a Trump foreign — campaign foreign policy adviser had with an individual in London about stolen emails that the Russians had that would be harmful to Hillary Clinton. It was weeks or months later that the so-called Steele dossier came to our attention. There are several problems with Comey’s explanation. First, the evidence released to date ",a50btv,self.Conservative,,True

Anyone want to guess what it'll be? Seems to me that they are teeing up polygamy/infidelity. I am often seeing articles extolling the virtues of cuckoldry and 'open marriage'.

"[Discussion] Should Conservatives favor a government shutdown, and/or less government?",Conservative," discusses the potential for the government to be shut down soon (I know I know, WAPost is yuck) and I’m sure we’re all well aware of the situation. My question, and something I’d really like to discuss with fellow conservatives, is whether we should be, or can be, optimistically looking at this situation. My belief has always been that the less government there is, the better. Now, that isn’t necessarily the mainstream for some people, and I understand that; I see it as more of a vice regarding government control. So, regardless of your view on the border situation and related policies, what is the consensus on the potential for government shut downs, and, is less government the conservative standard?

"[Long] Don't be fooled. Mitt Romney is a phony, a fraud, and his re-emergence is as damaging as his healthcare plan",Conservative,"I am glad to see the sub start to distrust Mitt Romney, but ocasionally I see people shift back to talking about his character or something, and how he's going to be a good Senator. While he can certainly change (coming from a former never-Trumper who thought he was another Nixon) all evidence throughout his life and even during the past few weeks says otherwise. Mitt Romney is a fraud, a hustler, an incompetent fool, and one of the greaetest 'Republican'political charlatons I've seen in my entire life. Let's recap, - He first ran for the Senate in Massachusets against Ted Kennedy. Switched as a Republican that year after being an Independent all his life. No biggie, people can switch parties and have their minds changed. He ran against Newt Gingrich's Contract with America (the reason Republicans dominated that year, something tells me this guy doesn't know how to win), positioned himself to the left of Kennedy on gay rights, claimed to be pro-choice and criticized Reagan. Oh well, it's Massachusets. The Republicans there are Democrats and the Democrats are commies. Smart political move I guess. In the end he lost by 17 points. Can't fault you for trying Mitt. - So it's 2002. Mitt dedicated his blood, sweat and tears to the most important event we have ever witnessed, the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Democrats are looking pretty bad again (seems like a pattern with this Democrat thing) so Republicans in Massachusets wanted Mitt to run in an open election for governor. Again he says he's a 'moderate with progressive views', pro-choicer and does some bizzare ad where he pretends to be . But this time he's more conservative than ever. Ran as a hawk on immigration, opposing amnesty. In true stockholm syndrome fashion, our alternative to a guy who just took the shit that is Obamacare is the only person ever in the United States to impose an individual mandate. Whatever though, he seems like one of the most conservative guys out there, even selects Paul Ryan. And... in the end we know what happened. But hey we expected too much to have some rich guy go out there with vague policy proposals and develop an anti-status quo camapaign. I mean that just doesn't work. - The third time's a charm! He was seriously looking to run in 2016 by [all accounts] ( Thankfully, conservaties told him to go away. You know the story from here. Romney ripped into Trump, did everything to derail his campaign and this game show host with funny hair won. Did I mention he dropped to his knees and accepted an endorsement from Trump in 2012? The guy attacked Trump for 'changing his positions over the years', if we could get any more ironic here Mitt Romney would put a fee on it. Like the principled guy he is, after suggesting Donald Trump was a fraud and even saying his foreign policy 'would make America less safe' he accepted an interview for Secretary of State. Didn't get the job, guess Trump just had binders full of competent people. - In the end he's back as a Senator, getting elected through playing the identity politics game. Now he's totally against restrictions on immigration, and Trump's attitude towards China. And even wants the [Mueller proble to continue] ( In the end the moment from this debate summarizes Mitt Romney's political career. Newt Gingrich preaches to the choir at the end of the video. Mitt Romney is not principled or an outsider he can only claim to be one because he's lost so many times. He's always wanted a piece of the political establishment.  Why the attacks on Trump now? This post will inevtiably be replied to by concern trolls with 'TRUMP FLIP FLOPS TOO'. That's great, tell me how many times Trump has run for public office. Donald Trump is everything Mitt Romney wants to be, the rich buisnessman that loved his life but saw a call to public service and actually won. And because he can't get that he attacks him and decided to virtue signal as an Anti-Trump RINO. But somehow this infatuation with him continues. Good riddance Mittens.

When answering, think about the society we live in today to help with your response. NOTE: While I understand many people feel the BOR is fine as is, this assignment is meant for you to think critically. You should answer both parts to this question.' &#x200B; Am I going crazy or is this really dumb? Why should they have to argue for less rights?? I know universities are left leaning like crazy, but this is just stupid. Can anyone lend some thoughts on this and let me know if I just sound irrationally irritated or if I am justified? I know it's just a question, but still. It seems ludicrous to ask someone to consider what rights they don't need from the BOR. Maybe I'm wrong.",a3ievb,self.Conservative,,True

My liberal uncle tried pitching me this idea... LOL,Conservative,"For some context, my uncle and I just moved to Colorado 4 months ago. Him from Los Angelas, myself from TX. We live together, he a bleeding 36 y/o liberal, myself 23 y/o conservative. For the past 3 years, the heater has been out in my truck. It was never too cold where I lived in Texas so I never cared too much to get it fixed. Fast forward to living in Colorado and where I live now, it snows daily. My uncles' (who works from home 'for himself'/can barely make ends meet) 2018 jeep sits in the garage. As my 2007 Nissan stays outside/freezes over night, nightly.. I go to work at 6am so every morning I get up early, get some warm water and pour it over my truck (not too warm) and go at it with an ice scraper and head to work. Never complain, it's just what I need to do until I can finally afford to fix the heat.. I have no truck payments and feel like my life is pretty great as I'm not bogged down with all these different payments. Just rent/bills. The normal. Anyways, my uncle tries pitching me the idea that I should just sell my truck because the heat doesn't work and it's pretty beat up. And because he works from home, he never really drives his brand new jeep anywhere, so I could use it to go to work etc and 'share' it with him, along with splitting the payments... I explain how I currently have no car payments now and it's great. I get everywhere I need to now just fine/don't complain about the heat issue and I really don't want to be paying for a car that isn't mine. It doesn't make much sense to him but he finally gives up after pressing the issue for 10 minutes. While walking away he asks why I don't just take his car to work every morning because of the weather. I explain to him how I don't complain with what I have and I make it work. Also how I was intending on using my next paycheck to finally repair the heater in my truck so this wouldn't be an issue for me any longer.... I hate turning things into politics, but I just think it's funny. One person in the house goes to work daily, doesn't complain/ask for anything and enjoys' life greatly. The other buy's things he can't afford (often), constantly makes remarks on how terrible our president is how dumb I am for being a supporter. While also asking me to give up what i've paid for just to share payments with him to make his life easier, for something that won't even be mine.

It’s Been a Bad Week for Liberals as Their Inner Workings Begin to Come to Light. Links In Post.,Conservative,"This article from the Washington Post discusses a recent research paper by two authors that reveal how Liberals will “talk down” to minorities in something called “competence downshift.”  Please note, people are already trying to dismiss this paper because it hasn’t been peer reviewed. Which, although is a legitimate criticism, the authors are obviously Liberal and if this had it flipped where Conservatives talked down to minorities, it would be widely accepted. My personal opinion. As noted in the Washington Post, this paper is based on what the authors stress is “preliminary evidence.” Most likely because their findings aren’t what they wanted. And they also interject personal opinions throughout the paper to try and spin the results as much as possible. In the paper they make sure to note, through their own opinion, that because Conservatives don’t do this it is because they “don’t care” (ie racist). The author writes this gem, “we know empirically that white conservatives are less likely to be interested in getting along with racial minorities.” As a personal aside I am a White Conservative living in a very Liberal city working for a very diverse company and am quite popular with my coworkers because I am always friendly and show respect to everyone. I don’t talk differently to anyone because I don’t view anyone as less than. I believe Conservatives look at people as people and judge them as people based on individual ability, not based on their skin color. Liberals look at skin color and then judge and act based on a persons skin color (ie truly racist). As this paper clearly shows. The author notes that minorities might not pick up on the shift but they may be aware of patronizing behavior. No shit. This next article is interesting as it talks about how narcissistic people don’t support democracy. And since all social media are liberal shitholes where they can circlejerk their wokeness, reading between the lines it really shows how much Liberals hate Democracy.  And a bonus video. One of my all time favorites. I used to be very liberal and this video reflects one large reason I walked away. Love posting this one. ",a3o124,self.Conservative,,True

Because I enjoy people, I enjoy the fast pace, and for 2 months out of the year I work my rear end off and enjoy every second of it! It's just become a tradition. Every year our tax accountant says the same thing 'You know, you won't see hardly any of this money because it all gets taken for taxes'. He's right - but then again, it is not about the money. I genuinely enjoy the people and the 'busy time of the year'. However, this year more than ever it has me thinking. Here I am, working two jobs -- one that pays very well, the other just a standard retail job -- and what thanks do I get from the tax man for it? Nada! Zip! Zilch! I am putting in literally 18 hour days and I see little to no benefit financially. Meanwhile, I turn on the news or radio and all I hear is the millennial whining going on constantly about how they don't like something, some song offends their precious feelings, or how they want to just 'wipe away student loan debt'. It has me to the point that I am boiling mad. I never seen such a group of people who want EVERYTHING for nothing. Where I work, for example, I tell people I work a 2nd job and when I hear someone say they could use a little extra money or something I always bring up 'Well, we are hiring at Department Store X working the evening shifts!' You'd think I was speaking in tongue. How DARE I suggest they get a 2nd job? I had one whiner basically try and lecture me about how they shouldn't have to work so hard to fix the screw ups that MY generation caused. I just walked away and let her keep on babbling. I'm a Democrat, and have voted mostly Democrat through the years - but I don't vote on party lines, I vote for the person. I find myself increasingly leaning more conservative as I get older. I think it really all is boiling down to this young generation and how entitled they are to be honest. I grew up (as a Gen X) poor, but we got by. Mom and dad worked, and I was working by the time I was 13 bagging groceries. We never turned down an opportunity. We never complained about what we didn't have. Yet nowadays that is all I hear is the constant complaining of this bunch. It's wearing me thin to be honest. &#x200B; Thanks all, just needed to get that off my chest.... &#x200B; &#x200B;",a67dv0,self.Conservative,,True

I was banned from a sub solely because I post in r/conservative and have high good karma here.,Conservative,"My main browsing of Reddit is r/all. If I find something interesting, I'll go into the post and comment. Once such journey brought me to r/latestagecapitalism. Come to find out, that's a socialism sub. The post I commented on was regarding tax percentage rate. I just suggested that there needs to be a formula to calculate tax rate based on income so it's commensurate for all incomes. A seemingly innocuous comment that didn't detract at all from the comments. The next day, I get a message that I've been banned from the sub. Something to do with Karma. The message is hard to understand because of some of it's formatting. Seemed like it was automatically generated. I get on their mod mail to try to sort this out. I'm not stranger to sub bans. During the election, I was banned from r/esist and r/bluemidterm2018, somewhat justified. When the mod, or whoever because the message is anonymous, gets back to me, I'm informed that the ban was because I had too much good Karma in 'reactionary subreddit.' When I inquired what that meant, I learned that they view r/conservative as a place where 'many users there express anti-communist, anti-lgbt, and anti-worker sentiments.' I pointed out that that rule was not one of their posted rules and stated that I did not post anything to detract from the sub nor have I posted anything in r/conservative that expressed those anti values. So my ban was exclusively based on my participation in a contradictory sub. I was told that if I want my ban to be reviewed, I needed to submit 5-7 sentences that described me politically. Good riddance, I say. **EDIT:** After some googling archived Reddit discussions, I found that this type of banning is actually against the moderator etiquette and rules.

"[Rant] As an independent, I don't agree with every conservative political position: I am however very annoyed with liberals because I find most of their grievances/political focus out of touch...",Conservative,"I am an independent, and take issues as they come rather then let myself be defined by a single label that determines all of my viewpoints. I like to think I'm open minded and well researched on topics I care about. There are certain issues that I side with Republicans on, and some issues I side with Democrats on. However, in recent years I feel like democrats are growing more and more out of touch with middle America. For some reference, I grew up in Kentucky. It's not a glorious place I realize, but I liked it enough. Things felt normal to me there, despite the struggles of the recession. Things weren't perfect, but nothing felt drastic. Life went on. I decided when I graduated High School to get out of my bubble, and go to a completely new place for college. I ended up in the Northwest, which is really liberal. I think life here is very beautiful with the amount of nature here, but the people have really insane views that are apparently considered mainstream for the area. For one, I really fucking hate politically correct identity politics. Everyone makes a big deal about being white for some reason, and people like to get fussy butthurt and particular over what you say. No, I'm not shouting racist slurs or anything and trying to downplay it. I've literally been lectured to before about why it's incorrect to say 'Chinese New Year' because other nations besides China celebrate the *ehem: Lunar New Year* , or how I'm stupid for admiring Abraham Lincoln because he was in fact racist (check your privilege, Mr_College_Dropout) , or how Professors and Students in class will talk about how the United States actually has no culture (WHAT? Seriously? Barbecue, Baseball, Football, Roadtrips, Rock, Rap/R&B, mean nothing?). When I try to play devils advocate and have meaningful discussion with people about *why* so many support border security, and refugee vetting, or protectionist trade policies, that it's not as simple as racism..... I just labeled as racist. They want to preach to me about rape culture....while ignoring atrocities occurring towards woman and gays in the Muslim World. They get mad at stereotypes of minorities in the media...while cracking jokes about poor white trash that are common in my home state. I just...I dont get it. America's biggest problem right now is the growing income inequalities that are causing the middle class to shrink, leaving *everyone* with a little bit less, and having to work just ever more harder. But no...we focus on...fucking bathrooms? Fucking, what some white actor said in his tweets 10 years ago? I legit feel these people live in their own world.",a6kk2f,self.Conservative,,True

Supporting Donald Trump has almost ruined my life,Conservative,"Throwaway because some online friends know my main and wouldn’t approve of my “choices”. I live in notoriously blue parts of California for context. This all stared during the presidential elections while I was 16, too young to vote. I have always found myself supporting more democratic candidates although I guess I am more centralized (for the lack of a better term). Even though I couldn’t vote I found myself doing research as if I were going to vote. Going into the elections I just couldn’t find myself supporting Hillary Clinton, mainly based on her email scandals and  along with other issues she commonly flip flops on to be agreeable to the American population. At the same time, I found the Republican Party more and more appealing, especially abortion and second amendment rights. This leads me to support Donald Trump and almost ruin my life. I never really intended to broadcast my support for trump, but getting closer and closer to Election Day debates with my friends started happening. They would talk shit about Trump and I tried to keep my mouth shut, but when it comes to illegal immigration it’s a touchy subject for me. I am against illegal immigration, and feel that if people want to come to America badly they can put in the effort to get a green card or a travel visa. My friends, however are in full support of immigration. After a few debates like this I found myself hanging out less and less with them, and eventually I was removed from our Snapchat group that I have been a part of for many years, since 7th grade (I was in 11th the time). I manage to make new friends after this who don’t give a fuck about politics and like me for the person I am. So currently I am a freshman in college (not going to reveal which one). I still have my two good friends from high school and my brother to hang out with, so I’m happy. I’ve even met a girl at school who I’m hitting it off with and we’ve been on a few dates. In all of our discussions politics have never been brought up as I thought it wasn’t relevant. So one night after some drinks, we go back to my dorm to “get coffee”. As I’m in the bathroom, I hear yelling in my dorm and then a door slam shut. I quickly hurry out and she is gone, and my MAGA hat which was sitting on a dresser is now gone (it took me a good 30 seconds to realize). So I chase her out and watch her throw the hat into a dumpster and yell obscenities at me (relating to rape, racism, and homophobia). The homophobia hit me hard, as she knows that my twin brother is gay and I am fully supporting him. (For the record, bro is also trump supporter). That happened two days ago and I’m still in shock. She told my roommates who thankfully don’t give a fuck, but has apparently told other people that I am a “rapist cunt.” I don’t know what to do right now, I just need to get this off my chest. Edit: thank you to everyone who responded! Just a quick few notes I will not be pursuing legal action at this time, because the school fortunately did not take my exes side. They sent an administrator to my dorm and we convinced her that I had done nothing wrong and it was a jealous ex. If anything harmful does come from her rantings tho, I will be perusing full legal action. ",a2igsm,self.Conservative,,True

Help Make /r/Conservative Even Better!,Conservative,"Hello there. Are you a regular commenter/poster here at /r/conservative? Have you ever thought, 'Man, there's a lot of lefties here, fouling up our subreddit,' like, all the time? I know I have, and I'm a mod! We mods can't see everything, and we want active users to help us deal with the brigaders, the trolls, the losers, and the socialists here to ruin our subreddit. Here's what to do: if you see a comment/post you think is some leftist wasting our time or breaking the rules, send a message to /r/conservative with the link and the name of the user in question. Explain what you're seeing and what you think is wrong. It'll hit the modmail, mods will review it and determine if actions is necessary. Be aware that we make no promise of a response: we barely have the time to act as it is, but we will review and take action. This is also self-policing. If some leftist attempts to report a conservative's comment or post, we'll actually be reading the content that's been accused, and if it doesn't violate the rules, we don't take action. If he tries it too many times, we'll notice and deal with him if we have to. We have been dealing with the never-ending march of trolls and leftists invading our subreddit, but we cannot increase our effectiveness unless you help us help you. We're not asking this of the newbs, the some-timers, the weaklings, or the timid. They're doing the best they can as it is. We're calling out to the the long-timers, the active, the loyal, and the full-hearted regulars. We don't want this once, or for a week, or even for a month.

A Year-End Message from the Mods,Conservative,"We want to thank everyone for an outstanding 2018. It has been a tremendous year, and we’ve experienced growth beyond what we thought possible. We’ve added more than 50,000 subscribers, increasing our base by about 33%. We’ve added two mods (welcome /u/Guitarwizard90 and /u/Beachcruisin22). We’ve increased our monthly pageviews from about 4.2 million in January to 6.6 million through this point in December. **The State of Politics in General** Certainly, it’s been a topsy-turvy year in politics: the president has been fascinating, and has had triumphs and blunders. Republicans increased their control of the Senate, but unfortunately lost control in the House of Representatives, and we end the year with a question as we have a partial government shutdown. However, his personal popularity remains relatively high. **Hostility Conservatives Face on Reddit** Dealing with lefties is not going to get better, unfortunately. There are numerous subreddits which utterly loathe us, such as /r/chapotraphouse and more recently /r/topmindsofreddit, and they will continue attacking our subreddit. Subscribers may be attacked for no reason other than our activity in the subreddit. Admin will probably continue to ignore the difficulties we face, like the brigading. Those of you who are active in politics in the real world undoubtedly experience such things, and we admire your willingness to keep it up. **Important Details** There are a few things we want to cover as the year ends. 1. We get some complaints about our “Conservatives Only” policy. This is something we are not going to change: a small number of posts are going to be designated “Conservatives Only,” and only people who have earned conservative flair on the subreddit will be able to comment there. 2. We need to reiterate that this is not a debate or open forum for all kinds of ideas. We have a mission statement, which states: 'We provide a place on Reddit for conservatives, both fiscal and social, to read and discuss political and cultural issues from a distinctly conservative point of view'. Let me be clear: liberals and leftists and their point of views are not welcome here. If you decide to infect our subreddit, we will do whatever it takes to make sure conservative conversation is favored. 3. If you see abuse, attacks, or anything which breaks the rules on the sidebar, please report them. We have the report button, or you can message us by sending a PM to /r/conservative. As the mods, we have hit the ceiling, as there only about twenty of us, but there are over 170,000 of you, and if you are reporting violations, we can deal with them, when they might otherwise be missed. **Thanks from the Modgroup** We want to thank everyone who has participated and made /r/conservative the top conservative subreddit in reddit. We intend to keep growing through 2019, keep reporting the news that the mainstream media misses, and to give a voice to all those that otherwise wouldn’t be heard in the sea of leftism that is Reddit. Thanks for making this a great place to be in 2018, Mods",ab76zd,self.Conservative,,True

Why SJW Crybabies are wrong about “Baby it’s Cold Outside”,Conservative,"First, let’s begin by looking at the lyrics. Any discussion about the song must begin with an understanding of what’s actually going on. _________________________________________________________ I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry? Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell I ought to say no, no, no - Mind if I move in closer? At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride? I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out Ah, but it's cold outside I've got to get home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there You've really been grand - Thrill when you touch my hand Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me? There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died I really can't stay - Get over that hold out Ah, but it's cold outside Oh, baby, it's cold outside Oh, baby, it's cold outside _____________________________________________________ There are a few things that have to be understood: First, the woman in song has never said no. This cannot be overstated: she said that she ought to say no, but at no point has she made it clear that she wanted to stop. It’s important to know that although she’s using “can’t” and “shouldn’t,” she has made no determination to stop the interaction, leave, or otherwise end the night. Second, this woman is indecisive, but she’s leaning towards staying. She’s playing hard to get a little, and she’s clearly wanting to stay with the guy. She’s giving excuses, but she herself isn’t trying stand her ground. She’s trying to feel good about her probable decision to stay. Is this a statement about women in general? Of course not. This is a small scene between one man and one woman. Third, there is no force or even explicit pressure from the man. There’s implication, there’s a bit of seduction (of the 1940s style), but there’s nothing more. Her arguments, though potentially valid, are almost all social in nature; his responses are personal and practical in nature. Finally, the resolution (of a sort) is never stated. By stating that it’s a song about date rape, SJWs are extrapolating well beyond what the song says. Also, SJWs are applying their own views and notions to the language of the 1940s. That would be like blaming Dwight Eisenhower for not using supersonic jet planes in WWII. SJWs are merely assuming that the evening ends with sex and that she never wanted it, even though the song never says so. The song is implicative on purpose. It draws images in people’s minds because there is so much that the song does not say. Let me finish by saying that I do not like, and never have liked, this song. I don’t like the implicative nature, and I am not comfortable with “sexy” Christmas songs. The notion of Christmas is important enough not to cheapen with such nonsense. I’ve never called for the song to be pulled off the radio and I’ve never complained publicly: I just don’t listen to it. _______________________________________________________ **EDIT** I was recently accused of being a liar and not putting in lyrics to my own advantage. I don't like being called a liar, and as evidence of at least my innocence of copying and pasting lyrics *as they were*, if not copying the best version, I am submitting a link to the website from which I got the lyrics.  Again, I am not here to base my arguments on lies. I did not look at any other lyrics websites. Perhaps there are other versions of the song sung which make it out the woman gives a hard no, but this one didn't, and I have no memory from my youth a hard no being in there. I claim ignorance in such matters, but I forcefully denounce the idea that I lied.",a5ujvz,self.Conservative,,True

"From a former democrat, I need to rant",Conservative,I used to support a lot of leftist arguments but recently i just can’t stand it anymore. It’s like liberals and Democrats are almost completely different things now and i am unable to continue calling myself a liberal. Being liberal used to be about supporting democratic views but now it’s mainly about opposing republican views no matter the issue. I’m tired of not feeling as though i can say any of my views because not supporting every single democratic view makes me a racist or just bullied in general. Along with that I’m tired of seeing how all the liberals like to gang up on twitter and just find as much news they don’t agree with and blame it on trump or the “racist republicans”. ,a65agk,self.Conservative,,True

Are there any decent right-leaning (or at least not left leaning) mostly non political podcasts?,Conservative,"I know there are a lot of conservative political podcasts where they talk about actual politics. Rush, Daily Wire, Buck Sexton, Dan Bongino, etc. I subscribe to all of those, but it can get pretty repetitive to listen to the same clips from the media about the same stories and hear 4 or 5 roughly similar takes on the same stuff day after day. I can only handle so much Mueller, Russia collusion, and whatever other big ticket story of the week is going on before just being sick of it all. So I'm wondering if there are any podcasts about movies, video games, history, whatever that are decidedly **not** going to push a leftist line. They don't even have to be right leaning, I just don't want leftism shoved under my nose when I'm trying to hear about the latest movie reviews or some interesting historical trivia or the latest stories in gaming/tech or whatever. Anyone have any ideas of fun, interesting, engaging, or educational podcasts that are *not* centrally focuses on talking about modern politics, but are also absolutely *not* even slightly trying to slip leftism in under the radar?

Is the bulk of r/politics unemployed?,Conservative,"So I’ve only just started branching out into new subs on reddit (aside from the original ones that drew me here) and I’m actually shocked at how left-leaning things like r/politics and r/economics is. Now when you read the content/comments people post there is a few noticeable things: 1. Clear sense of entitlement - as in it seems a good 50-60% of posts are about somehow getting free shit from the government 2. Everyone appears to be qualified in an economics degree? 3. Very controversial figures even on the left seem to be praised. An absolute prime example is Alexander Ocasio-Cortez: as a non American I can see that this woman is quite borderline insane, radical, quite stupid (I don’t say that to insult, just watching interviews confirms this) and attention seeking; someone should not be allowed In office, someone I thought even the left saw as crazy. Yet on r/politics she’s hailed like a god. I guess this has turned into a bit of a rant but the gist I get from these left leaning areas of reddit, is that the users are either: A) Unemployed and unwilling to find work - under some impression an all providing socialist utopia will solve all their issues B) Full time college/university students - by this I mean they’re people who trudge their way as slow as possible through a useless degree, and upon completion begin immediately studying something else, the idea being you never have to work if you’re constantly at university - this is very common where I come from, not sure about elsewhere though. I guess what I’m asking is are my observations accurate? Do you guys feel the same? Some of these left-wing breeding grounds remind me on an old saying my Grandpa used to say to me: “Everyone’s progressive until they grow up and get a job, then they become conservative”. Another final point I wanted to add is that a lot of these people give off the impression that they’re under 25/ the frontal lobe (where logic spurns from) of their brain is not yet developed. So is it possible that a reason so many younger people seem to be drawn to progressive politics is literally because they’ve yet to properly develop their brain? (I’m only 22 myself to note, so not an attack on young people) Anyway sorry for the essay and thanks for reading if you bothered! ",a4nxjp,self.Conservative,,True
