Quora had a security breach,technology,"Just got this email. We are writing to let you know that we recently discovered that some user data was compromised as a result of unauthorized access to our systems by a malicious third party. We are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience this may cause. We are working rapidly to investigate the situation further and take the appropriate steps to prevent such incidents in the future. What Happened On Friday we discovered that some user data was compromised by a third party who gained unauthorized access to our systems. We're still investigating the precise causes and in addition to the work being conducted by our internal security teams, we have retained a leading digital forensics and security firm to assist us. We have also notified law enforcement officials. While the investigation is still ongoing, we have already taken steps to contain the incident, and our efforts to protect our users and prevent this type of incident from happening in the future are our top priority as a company. What information was involved The following information of yours may have been compromised: Account and user information, e.g. name, email, IP, user ID, encrypted password, user account settings, personalization data Public actions and content including drafts, e.g. questions, answers, comments, blog posts, upvotes Data imported from linked networks when authorized by you, e.g. contacts, demographic information, interests, access tokens (now invalidated) Questions and answers that were written anonymously are not affected by this breach as we do not store the identities of people who post anonymous content. What we are doing While our investigation continues, we're taking additional steps to improve our security: We’re in the process of notifying users whose data has been compromised. Out of an abundance of caution, we are logging out all Quora users who may have been affected, and, if they use a password as their authentication method, we are invalidating their passwords. We believe we’ve identified the root cause and taken steps to address the issue, although our investigation is ongoing and we’ll continue to make security improvements. We will continue to work both internally and with our outside experts to gain a full understanding of what happened and take any further action as needed. What you can do We’ve included more detailed information about more specific questions you may have in our help center, which you can find here. While the passwords were encrypted (hashed with a salt that varies for each user), it is generally a best practice not to reuse the same password across multiple services, and we recommend that people change their passwords if they are doing so. Conclusion It is our responsibility to make sure things like this don’t happen, and we failed to meet that responsibility. We recognize that in order to maintain user trust, we need to work very hard to make sure this does not happen again. There’s little hope of sharing and growing the world’s knowledge if those doing so cannot feel safe and secure, and cannot trust that their information will remain private. We are continuing to work very hard to remedy the situation, and we hope over time to prove that we are worthy of your trust. The Quora Team",a2vqnj,self.technology,,True

A foldable drone that can rescue survivors from collapsed buildings,technology,"**Abstract** The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this work, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology. More:  &#x200B;",a7lg02,self.technology,,True

End of 40 hour work week—because of automation???,technology,"People are talking about the end of the 40-hr work week, talking about 4-day weekends every weekend and such. Saying automation and technology will enable human beings to work less—but by getting paid more per hour, we'll still make decent livable wages. I don't know. Part of me thinks this is all sunny, glowy, rose-tinted thinking. (Wasn't this workless society the utopian dream of sci-fi writers in like the 50's?) I'm also thinking about just how many unions, Teamsters and other worker's groups out there will resist—vehemently—any automation of their jobs, like trucking or taxi driving. I'm also thinking about the intense safety, regulatory and quality checks that any automation will have to overcome—if it ever does. And I'm also thinking that the biggest challenge is that you're messing with people's livelihoods. With that model of Mon-Fri, 9-5, that so many of us (and our schools and industries and governments) all base the framework of our lives on. However, that Mon-Fri model is already disintegrating. A lot of people need two jobs, night shifts, work at home at all hours, telework, etc...Universities are offering weekend courses, night courses. Media has already largely gone 24/7. And, a lot of the time, workers don't have a say. If a company wants to automate—needs to automate to stay competitive—then those are winds of change that not any union or government or anyone can do anything about. Or necessarily should do anything about. In the end, I don't see wide-ranging automation everywhere—a future where robots do most of the work. Neither do I see zero automation, or a return to some hardworking glory days of lesser automation. (Heck, the first repetitive machines, such as the steam engine and cotton gin and, yes, the wheel, were novel automations that more often than not improved our quality of life.) I do see, though, a new normal approaching on the horizon. That new normal may simply be greater diversity of working life. Some people stick to a stock schedule. Some work willy-nilly. Some take years off. Others will work from 15 yo to 85 yo nonstop. Some people will be lazy and only work as much as necessary. Some people will be busy, loving work and more work and more work. But, what that new normal will truly be, we'll all just have to wait and see. ",a6758x,self.technology,,True

"People are technologically illiterate, and that's why they are mad at Facebook, and fooled by news headlines.",technology,"To clarify, I'm talking about the recent hate bandwagon. I'm not saying that you don't have your own valid reason for hating Facebook. The recent bandwagon is based in ignorance though. Here's two examples: **People being angry that Facebook allowed Netflix, and Spotify the ability to read, and delete messages.** This is a super common practice. Spotify isn't going in, and looking at your nudes. Apps need read/write access for messenger integration. If you go on spotify and click 'share' on a song and click facebook messenger, it will open a window of your contacts, inside spotify and who to send it to, then it goes right back to normal spotify. This feature is only possible if spotify has CRUD access. Create, read, update, delete. Getting mad about this would be like getting mad that your email manager wants to read, write and delete your emails. Netflix wasn't looking at your nudes either, this was the thing where you could click 'join account' on your netflix or something and it would take you to a facebook page which said 'company xyz would like to access your account to do the following things..... allow / deny'? It just meant you could do things like for example (not a real example) click like on a netflix video and it would autopost on your facebook that you're enjoying the new TV show.. That was the purpose behind it. It needs the ability to read your account and write to your account for that, and the user agreed to that. They didn't go to facebook and say 'hey facebook give us write access to all your user's accounts!'. Think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud or to read your email on Apple’s Mail app, it's the same thing. When **you agreed to this,** it was clearly listed under this app need to : 'access your phones location read and write messages' we've all seen that warning 10-100 times . . its pretty blatant...For all those who are upset by this: how many of you are accessing reddit right now through a 3rd party app? Apparently people don’t want to be held responsible for their own decisions. People want relevant google results when they search for restaurants but get angry that google tracks their location. Android apps do this all the time when installing them, in that it allows you to see what an app can do on your phone. It's standard practice. You literally tell these apps “yes you can use this info” when they ask for permissions, and now everyone feels so violated? Don’t install the applications and grant them permission then! **People being angry about Facebook selling data** Facebook doesn't sell data. That's actually a common misconception. They direct ads to you based on the data that they have. They never sell that data to advertisers, and advertisers never see the data. The implication often made by people that say 'FB sells data'is that facebook tells whoever has money anything about you, in truth facebook never tells anyone anything about you. Facebook takes things people want to show to a certain demographic, and if you're in that demographic you see it, but they don't give info about you to advertisers. They don't take data, you agree to let them use data. You give them data in exchange for free facebook. They don't show advertisers any data, they do use data to make money. There's nothing wrong with that, most sites on the internet make money through ads, and ads are target based on data the sites have on you. If a banana seller asks you to go show a banana to someone that likes bananas, and you never tell them who that person was that you showed the banana to, then you never gave that person any information about the person. You just found someone that likes bananas, and connected them with the banana. In short Facebook doesn't sell data, Facebook sells access to your attention. I plagiarized from u/lanebrn711, u/DramamineQueen, u/houseflip, u/liquidpig, u/saquino88, u/3000dollarsuitCOMEON, u/Fireproofspider, u/dr_gonzo_13, u/halr9000 because I was too lazy to write some parts. Please don't take news headlines to heart without follow up research. Companies like the New York Times list Facebook as a direct competitor.",a87bwu,self.technology,,True

Is everyone really okay with the amount of control over our lives that we're giving to big tech companies?,technology,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this or if it's going to get taken seriously at all. Yesterday I was watching how they have a social credit system in some towns of China as an experiment, and that they would want this implemented fully by 2020, I was talking about this with some friends, and I was told something like this would never happen in the EU, that it's only China because it's so restrictive on it's own people. Now surely we don't have things like penalizations for doing 'bad deeds' and getting our rights taken away to buy things like train/plane tickets or taking loans from the bank, but it really hit me hard when I put together the bits of information I've learnt using my phones and computers these years. &#x200B; Specifically, Google tracking your moves on the Web and putting advertising that suits you more so you buy more stuff, what they tell you to buy specifically. If you have Google Maps and are using data on your phone, it tracks your every movemevent even if you are not using GPS, you can see this on 'Your Timeline' inside Google Maps, can be useful for tracking your phone if someone stole it but did not shut it down. Authorities can read through your personal conversations if you're considered suspicious of something. I believe some people and businesses will value other people and businesses based on the number on likes or followers that they have. &#x200B; Surely, there are some advantatges to all of these things, they can be helpful in certain situations but it makes me sick to think about all the control we unkowingly give to Google and social media, and I still believe we never really get the full picture from them. Right now, this doesn't seem like a big problem, because we don't have very restrictive rules or a very oppressive society, but if a government wanted to apply some of those restrictive rules and Google decides to work with them, they would be able to and we could do very little to fight back. I'm sure everyone here already knows this but I think many people using modern technology are not aware of some of these things, maybe it would be nice to raise some awareness so people are more careful about sharing their information with tech companies. Who knows, maybe I'm wrong?",a8bc18,self.technology,,True
