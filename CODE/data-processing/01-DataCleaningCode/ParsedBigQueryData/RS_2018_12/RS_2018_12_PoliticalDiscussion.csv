"With automation continuing to rise, what do you think of tax-breaks to employers for each employee as opposed to UBI?",PoliticalDiscussion,"As a capitalist, I see a real problem with automation looming. Capitalism says 'Yeah man, more robots and AI means more savings!' but it also says 'Oh look, all of your customers live in abject poverty now' The DSA suggests Universal Basic Income is the key. Just guarantee everyone a near-poverty level income so they don't starve. On the one hand, I like people not starving, but on the other hand I see a real problem with paying people to do nothing. Personally, I don't mind funding a great big safety net so that no American ever dies of exposure or starves. We're a rich nation, this should be a no-brainer. But my problem is that I think having healthy employable people be idle is super-bad. I think it causes society to start to break down. And my fear is that the idle-employable would not be able to find their place and would resent it and maybe become destructive. I think humans *need* jobs to feel a part of society. My alternative is rather than taxing everyone to pay people to do nothing, we tax everyone to pay companies to hire people. The amount we'd have to pay companies would adjust based on some variable criteria. More subsidies for better pay. Job satisfaction would be a requirement (no reimbursement if your employees hate you). Job safety is critical, no reimbursement if you have a lot of preventable injuries/illnesses. There'd also be a cap. You don't get reimbursed over a certain $ payment, so executives and upper management are exempt from the subsidies. It basically does the same thing as UBI, but maybe costs a little bit less (employers still pay some of the salaries).

"Do you think the 'blue wave', in the suburbs in particular, is a temporary shift?",PoliticalDiscussion," - Republicans haven't really changed up their strategy to appeal more to suburban areas, a group that they had previously relied on for support, but lost to the Democrats in the midterms. Do you think that this 'blue wave' is simply a temporary rebuke to Trump's presidency, or a sign of the changing values and demographics of America? Furthermore, do you even believe that there was a 'blue wave' as many commentators have been saying?",a30r4p,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True

The Next World Order,PoliticalDiscussion,"With the end of the Unipolar world order that has reigned since the collapse of Communism coming sooner or later, our attention must turn towards navigating the next one. China is ascendant, Russia revisionist, and the EU considering a unified military. How should the EU approach the world? Attempt to maintain the liberal order, or focus on their own regional development? How could the US attempt to show its ability to abide by its commitments? Or rebuild its influence and power? Will it try to? What are likely to be the biggest obstacles to China's rise?",a84ggi,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
Should politicians be required to periodically take questions from the public under oath?,PoliticalDiscussion,"I’m picturing something along the lines of what publicly traded companies do: put out quarterly earnings and hold a call where investors can ask questions. False or misleading statements in these venues would likely run afoul of securities laws. Would something similar work for high ranking government officials? Have the heads of the major agencies/branches put out quarterly reports and field questions directly from the public (perhaps mediated by the press) under penalty of perjury. There would be some limited ability to opt out of questions regarding national security, governed by the appropriate courts. Are there any countries that have attempted something like this?",a4t8w6,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
U.S. Options in Afghanistan and Peace with the Taliban,PoliticalDiscussion,"There have been reports of U.S. diplomats meeting Taliban spokespersons to broker a peace deal. Peace has been sought by Afghani president Ghani . With 17 years past since their original ouster, and the U.S. military describing the battle as a stalemate, is peace with the Taliban the only option? What assurances can be given that they will be a non-violent player in normal politics and not seize control? Could a similar situation to the U.S. pullout of Vietnam play out?",a76q6t,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
The US is Losing its Ability to Defend Itself Says National Defense Strategy Commission Report,PoliticalDiscussion,"The commission  that “America has reached the point of a full-blown national security crisis.” >“If the United States had to fight Russia in a Baltic contingency or China in a war over Taiwan, Americans could face a decisive military defeat,” the report warns. “These two nations possess precision-strike capabilities, integrated air defenses, cruise and ballistic missiles, advanced cyberwarfare and anti-satellite capabilities, significant air and naval forces, and nuclear weapons — a suite of advanced capabilities heretofore possessed only by the United States.” >Even if the United States were able to prevail, it would face “harder fights and greater losses than at any time in decades.” Air superiority, which the United States has taken for granted since World War II, is no longer assured. And, without control of the skies, U.S. ships and soldiers would be vulnerable in ways that are difficult to imagine. Is this a fair categorization? If so, How did the US get to the point? Is there any going back? What are the implications of the new world order?",a5xmms,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
Child labour abroad,PoliticalDiscussion,"Do we can all agree that child labour is bad, right? And we all agree that companies that hire children, and workers in general, in third world countries to exploit cheep labour are bad. I often see people saying they are not going to buy products from the Company X because they have cheep and/or child labourers abroad. But here's my problem with that. Those people might be getting paid in less that a dollar a day, but they ARE getting paid. Alternative for them is to not work and not get paid. If Company X bankrupts because people boycotted them for their child labour, well those children and families I'm third world countries will lose a part of their income. Believe me they would rather work the entire day for a dollar, than not work and get nothing. It seems that we should request grom thear companies to raise wages for those people but then we get another problem. Firstly, Western countries can't decide on laws of third world countries and even if companies were forced to raise their wages, they would just fire a massive chunk of their workforce and the majority of their workers would lose their less than a dollar of income. So what do you think we should do to fix this? Only thing that pops into my mind is to help third world nation's develope so that their citizens could get better job opportunities. But we also have a problem that many Western countries are in debt themselves, so sending their own tax payers money to foreign national would also probably be hotly debated ",aa05wj,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
"With the first Democratic primary debates set to take place in roughly six months, what are the advantages and disadvantages of announcing a presidential bid sooner rather than later?",PoliticalDiscussion,"The pros of announcing before your opponent seems clear; longer amount of time to fundraise, increase brand recognition, media coverage, increased likelihood that voters coalesce around you, etc. We saw Sanders gain incredible momentum in 2016, but by the time his popularity had reached it's peak, the primary was all but decided. If he had announced a few months earlier — I would think he would have had a better shot at the nomination. The disadvantages of declaring early are, however, not as apparent. An increased likelihood of 'fizzling' out? Or could it be that it is too expensive to run campaign operations for so long before actual elections take place? So let's discuss what the primary advantages disadvantages there are to announcing a presidential bid early. Does announcing sooner than your opponents often yield better results?",a9ot1j,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True

How will the Medicare for all/Free college Progressives differentiate themselves in the 2020 Democratic primary?,PoliticalDiscussion,"In 2016, it was just Bernie vs. Hillary. You either voted for the progressive wing of the Democratic party, or Hillary. Now there are at least 5 other contenders that have incorporated Bernie's platform into their own. So what happens when you have 5 or 6 candidates running essentially the same platform. How do they differentiate themselves from each other to become 'the' progressive candidate? What can they debate if they [progressives] all approve of implementing or expanding the same governmental programs? How will they respond to the question of, 'Why should I vote for you, as oppose to Kamala, Warren, Sanders, or Gillibrand?'. Attacks on their opponents past records? Proposing other government programs? Electability? The debates will be awfully boring if they all agree with one another. If it comes down to two progressives, what are they even going to debate about? Foreign policy? Who has a better chance at beating Trump?",a6tp4r,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
"Feasibility of giving citizens, not legislatures, the ability to choose where our tax $ go?",PoliticalDiscussion,"Certain bills have to be paid for no questions asked. But in terms of 'discretionary funds', has any legislative body (city, state, country) ever allowed each voter to allocate (say $1000) to the topics and causes they think are important? I think it would be very interesting to see how people would 'spend' the money. How many people fund 'the wall'? How many people fund the military? How many people fund green energy? How many build new schools?",a6fh2o,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True

"A federal judge has ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional as a whole due to interactions between the individual mandate and tax reform. How much merit does this argument have, and how will it fare in the Supreme Court?",PoliticalDiscussion,"A summary of tonight's ruling can be found here:  A lawsuit between several states opposing the Affordable Care Act and the government (which has declined to defend the ACA, therefore making the actual 'defendant' a consortium of pro-ACA states) has been given a ruling tonight. The ruling states that the ACA's individual mandate to purchase insurance is both unconstitutional and 'inseverable' from the remainder of the ACA. The ruling therefore effectively states that the ACA as a whole is unconstitutional and should be struck down. Given that healthcare is still a hot-button political issue for many of the states involved, it seems very likely that the consortium of pro-ACA states will appeal the case to the Supreme Court. Assuming that happens, how will/should the Court handle this case? The individual mandate has already been addressed in a 2012 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the 'penalty' for not buying insurance was a 'tax' and constitutional. (EDIT: this last sentence originally said 'unconstitutional' due to a typo.) Will the Court, which has changed substantially in membership since the 2012 case, decline to hear the case? If not, how will it address the merits of the most recent ruling? Is there a chance that the individual mandate will be split from the rest of Obamacare, or will it all be treated as one entity like in tonight's ruling? *Personal opinion* As a non-lawyer, the logic of this most recent ruling seems strange to me in light of what politically motivated both the 2012 and 2018 lawsuits. Basically the impetus for the original lawsuit was that the plaintiffs felt that imposing a tax/penalty on the uninsured was onerous and unconstitutional. Now that is has been ruled that the penalty was a 'tax' and constitutional, the new lawsuit argues that this 'tax' needs to be continually enforced in order to remain constitutional. Basically it seems like the original lawsuit was arguing that the individual mandate 'tax' should have been $0 but now that new legislation has changed it to actually be $0, the new lawsuit argues that it constitutionally needs to be not-$0. It seems like this new argument is based on a very opportunistic reading of the 2012 case. *End personal opinion*",a6bj5n,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True

"If single payer healthcare is unrealistic for the time being, what are some more realistic health reforms that could be passed in the near future",PoliticalDiscussion,"I'd like medicare for all, but even places like Vermont and California can't get it passed, so I doubt it goes anywhere in the next few years. I'd like it to, but I doubt it. So having said that, what other kinds of health reform do people think will happen that is realistic on either the state or federal level? Adding medicaid or medicare to the ACA exchanges? Increasing the subsidies for buying private insurance? Allowing reimportation of pharmaceuticals? Streamlining administration? Personally I'd like to see a law passed which states any of your AGI that goes to health care above 15% of your AGI will get automatic tax credits and subisides, including spending on insurance premiums. It isn't uncommon for some people (mostly temp workers and the self employed to spend 20-30%+ of their AGI on health care when you include premiums. That is unsustainable.

Do you think Medicare-for-all is feasible to implement in the United States?,PoliticalDiscussion,"Medicare-for-all is gaining a lot of popularity with some polls suggesting very high support from the public among both republicans and democrats. It’s also suggested that this type of single payer health care system would be vastly superior to the current operating system in the US. What would be the major hurdles to implementing this nationwide and what would be ways to overcome these hurdles? On the other hand, if people oppose this idea; why would you oppose this? And any recommendations on changing our current system?",a2xgrz,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
Should the electoral college be removed?,PoliticalDiscussion,"For a number of years, I have seen people saying the electoral college is unconstitutional and that it is undemocratic. With the number of states saying they will count the popular vote over the electoral vote increasing; it leads me to wonder if it should be removed. What do you think? If yes what should replace it ranked choice? or truly one person one vote (this one seems to be what most want)",a4lgb3,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True
"What are your long-shot, tinfoil-hat predictions for the next two to four years?",PoliticalDiscussion,"Mine is that in the coming years we will see more than one person running for public office claiming to be QAnon, and *at least* one of these candidates will win. Probably this will happen in some small local elections, but I wouldn't discount the possibility of some dude running for US Congress as Q. Tbf, tho, I thought this might even happen in the 2018 midterms, but now I think it might've been too soon since QAnon still claims to be a federal employee or something. Edit: ok so about half of these have been actual off the wall theories, the rest have just been mostly uncontroversial predictions.",a5bm58,self.PoliticalDiscussion,,True

Prosecutors believe that donald trump commanded Michael Cohen to commit a variety of felonies. Is impeachment justified if this is true?,PoliticalDiscussion," New York prosecutors are alleging “individual 1” commanded Michael Cohen to establish an illegal LLC in order to facilitate the transfer of money to a porn star and a playboy bunny, with the intent to influence the election and hide his adultry. Much talk has been made of impeachment for increasing parts of the electorate; is it possible that this may be the tipping point for a much more widespread call for impeachment?
