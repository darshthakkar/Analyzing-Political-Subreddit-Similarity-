We need to clean up this sub. Taking applications for new mods now.,TrueReddit,"Hey everyone, I worked as a temporary mod for TrueReddit a few years back. Technically I still am one, but for the most part I don't mod anymore. /u/kleopatra6tilde9, the creator of this sub, wanted this site to be self-moderated. That is, admins shouldn't remove anything and users should be responsible for moderation with their voting buttons. I don't think that strategy works in the era of paid trolls and increased brigading. Since she appears to have been off reddit for 2 years (and absent from this sub longer) we should think about moving to a more active moderation strategy. No offense to her, but things need to change. /u/DublinBen is the defacto mod of this sub, but I'm not sure if he's been around recently either. I think we should get four new active mods and hand it off to them. People who will keep high effort content and delete spam, pandering and misinformation. Obviously, the sub will lean extremely liberal due to the user base (people are still going to use upvotes and downvotes as agree/disagree buttons, unfortunately), but as long as something is cogent and well written it belongs here. For instance, **GOOD**: The Atlantic, The New York Times, Star Slate Codex, War is Boring, and yes, even National Review from time to time. Lesser-known sources are fine as long as they're well written. **BAD**: Blog spam, alt-right nonsense, low-effort liberal pandering (e.g. 'drug war = bad' articles, 'fuck Paul Ryan'). Even high-effort liberal pandering should be avoided. I'll wait for /u/DublinBen to respond, and if he doesn't in a few days I'll start the mod selection process. Comment here if you want to do it with a brief statement of why you're qualified for it. Also, **link to an insightful comment or article you've posted on this sub that's at least a month old.** ",a7zxzt,self.TrueReddit,,True
