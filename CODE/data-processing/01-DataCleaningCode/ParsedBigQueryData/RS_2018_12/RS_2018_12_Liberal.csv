"I have a question about corporations, shareholders, and economics",Liberal,"It all started last night when I was making chili mac for my family for dinner. I noticed that the two boxes of mac cheese and two cans of chili was no longer enough to go around, because there was less macaroni in the boxes. I am told that corporations are legally obligated to maximize profits for their shareholders. They must take any actions that will increase profits because otherwise they can be sued for mismanagement. I am wondering, what is the end game here? They can reduce the amount of macaroni in a box more and more until people simply refuse to buy it. Will we eventually be paying full price for a box with only two or three noodles? What about short-term versus long-term profits? What if an increase in pay to their workers will result in greater productivity? Would increasing wages still be considered a betrayal of their shareholders? What about harm to the community or the environment? Are corporations legally obligated to continue policies practices that pollute or that put a strain on public funds, because otherwise the shareholders will be mad? It seems to me that there ought to be some restraints on this kind of thinking. Obviously, we need laws to prevent corporate mismanagement of other peoples' money; but I don't think it should be an unbridled imperative. ",a342e6,self.Liberal,,True

A surreal conversation about public displays of military propaganda.,Liberal,"Throughout this area, up and down all the major streets, there are permanent banners celebrating the military and locals who are in it. Not people who died or *did* anything in particular, just people who happen to be in inform. Those displays have been there for years, and similar displays in other facets of local life have just been becoming more and more prevalent, while basically no other profession sees anything like that kind of public adulation. Finally, I got irritated recently with something another person was saying on the subject, and expressed my long-held thoughts about it. The result was a surreal dive into a rabbit hole of authoritarianism and brainwashing. This is paraphrased, but captures the gist: X: They deserve our respect and appreciation for their service. Me: Do you feel the same way about teachers? X: Absolutely. Me: Where are the banners for the teachers? X: I'm sure they're in lots of places. Me: Well, these banners for the military are *everywhere* around here. X: We don't want to leave anyone out, and they deserve a lot of respect for their service and sacrifice. Me: Do nurses deserve a lot of respect for their service and sacrifice? X: Of course, lots of people do. This isn't about that. Me: *Why* isn't it about that? Why is every major street in this area covered in praise of the military, while every other form of service is treated like it doesn't exist? X: Nothing stops you from putting up a display for teachers or anyone else. Are you going to? Me: It does *so* stop me from doing that - it's public property that needs approval from the city. And those military displays aren't some private citizen group's spontaneous act of generosity, they're taxpayer-funded and part of a nationwide propaganda campaign that's been going on since 2003. X: Our brave men and women in uniform deserve our respect for their service and sacrifice. (*At this point I felt a chill at the robotic way the guy recited this phrase from memory*) Me: If I went to the city council and proposed replacing half of those military displays with celebrations of local teachers, firefighters, nurses, doctors, or whatever, would you support it? X: Why would we have to disrespect the troops to respect anyone else? Me: Wait, so having *fewer* taxpayer-funded displays all over the city celebrating the military would be 'disrespectful' to them? They're *entitled* to being praised everywhere all the time? X: They deserve all the respect we can give them. Me: But it's not disrespectful of teachers, nurses, scientists, etc. to have *no* significant displays honoring them? Fewer displays for soldiers is 'disrespect,' but no displays at all for anyone else is *not* disrespect? X: The service and sacrifice of the troops deserve all the appreciation we can give them. If you want to honor someone else, no one's stopping you. Me: But they *are* stopping me. I just told you that. It's public property and they don't want to 'distract' from the military displays by putting up other things. X: Why are you so angry about this? Don't you think our Brave Troops Deserve to Be Honored for Their Service and Sacrifice? It just went downhill from there. I lost count of the number of times the terms 'service' or 'sacrifice' were used as a thought-terminating cliche to deflect from some painful contradiction they were caught in.
