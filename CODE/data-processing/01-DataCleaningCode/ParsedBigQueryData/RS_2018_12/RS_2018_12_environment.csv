Australia's answer to soft plastics,environment," The REDcycle initiative aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste that enters landfill, by converting soft plastics into outdoor furniture-which can continually be recycled again an again. So far, the company has collected over 380 million pieces of soft plastics, and only 7% of the items collected has made its way to the landfill (due to contamination). In recycling the plastics, no fumes are emitted in detriment to the environment, making it at little to no extra cost to the environment. The website lists the types of common household waste that can be disposed, including; any plastic bags, chip wrappers, chocolate wrappers, cling wrap etc- generally any soft plastic that can be rolled into a ball. I only recently discovered the bins (which can be found in Coles and Woolworths all over the country) and it's as easy as keeping a separate plastic bag and filling it with this waste and dropping it off every time you do some grocery shopping. In doing so, I've noticed much less rubbish entering the regular garbage bin. So if you live in Australia, consider heading to the website and seeing if there are any collection points near you and begin reducing the amount of rubbish that heads to the landfill! It's currently not well known, so it'd be great if more people could start recycling waste that would generally accumulate in the normal green bin as a small contribution in helping the environment. &#x200B;",a7vb7c,self.environment,,True
Calling all humans: Time to take action and end the global collapse of biodiversity,environment,"The conservation of wild species around the globe is unquestionably necessary for the persistence of humankind. As individuals, we need to take responsibility for the global chaos that we've caused, and start reversing it by making more wildlife-friendly choices. The recently published Living Planet Report 2018 by the World Wildlife Fund reflects this, by documenting a 60% decline in wild animal populations over the last 40 years. &#x200B; Although this global collapse of biodiversity is devastating from a nature standpoint, humans often only call an issue into action when it threatens our own way of living. The benefits we receive from nature often feel far removed from out every day lives, seeming to be relevant for science, tourism, spirituality and nothing more. Once we start understanding that nature is the backbone of our health, economy, security and general livelihoods, then our motivation to push back against species depredation can fuel the large-scale change that is needed. &#x200B; Whether its the 70% of medical drugs and treatments derived from natural resources, the 35% of global food production made possible through natural pollinators, or the protection we receive from coral reefs against storm surges and large waves from the open sea, we can't deny that humanity is largely dependent on nature's many services. Because of this, the conservation of the world's biodiversity should be on everyone's radar. &#x200B; We can think of biodiversity loss like a cake recipe. All of the ingredients come together to make one delicious dessert. If you lose an ingredient like sugar, the cake will still be a cake, but it might taste funny. If you also lose the flour, then your cake won't be much of a cake at all. Biodiversity is similar in that all species are part of a larger global system. If we lose one species to extinction, the effects will ripple down and weaken the entire network. The system might still function, but it won't be the same. If we lose even more species to extinction, then the entire system could fail. &#x200B; The biggest threats to biodiversity and our earth's natural resources are agriculture, overexploitation, and energy development. Agriculture is responsible for an estimated 80% of global deforestation, and is driven by non-necessary dietary preferences and lifestyles of the western world. We plow forests down for crop fields, and we allow our livestock to graze and trample natural habitats down to the bare bones of the earth. &#x200B; Overexploitation is a primary driver of species loss on land and at sea. I'm sure everyone can remember the massive crash of Atlantic Cod populations in the 90s, which was devastating for both nature and humans, destroying the marine life, coastal economy, and many peoples livelihoods. &#x200B; Energy development is largely dependent on fossil-fuel burning, which contributes to over 60% of our worlds carbon footprint. The impacts of energy development on biodiversity are less obvious to the untrained eye, but the green house gasses produced by this industry are largely responsible for global climate change. Climate change as a whole has huge impacts on wildlife activity, persistence, distribution and abundance across the globe. &#x200B; As individuals, we can combat these industries by starting to make small changes in our every day lives. The following three changes are a good start. &#x200B; First, we need to fight mass-agriculture by harvesting our own small gardens, and choosing more sustainable meat sources; local is often the better choice. &#x200B; Second, we need to be conscious of where our consumer products come from, and refuse to support industries that thrive on overexploitation such as mass- fisheries, or the palm oil industry; read product labels to inform yourself of what activities you are supporting. &#x200B; Finally, make more energy-efficient choices; use more sustainable transportation, decrease energy use in your home, and avoid buying products that support massive energy development. &#x200B; If we all start taking steps towards creating a more wildlife-friendly world, then governments, and industries will have to follow suit. We can spark the large-scale change that we'd like to see on our planet, and give our children, and grandchildren a more promising world to live in. @CarlyEcology",a3gnf6,self.environment,,True

One of them is that the power sector is poised to both field a dramatic increase in electricity demand and defend against extreme hazards and efficiency losses, owing to higher temperatures. The sector has responded fiercely to climate change—but it still faces potentially debilitating uncertainty.

"Is there free will, or is it all just bullshit?",environment,"*Mery Xmas* The golden ratio is full spectrum everywhere mathematically, in places both big and small. Too much math will turn you into a Zen Buddhist, or maybe worse, a Taoist, whatever that is. I always found that when I look into my belly button too deeply, it stares right back at me. This next chick is smart as a whip and funny as a bunny. She says math can prove free will. I only have one rule, don't believe what you can't understand, that's why I never trust physicists or priests, or believe pretty girls, but I'll always pretend to believe a smart pretty girl.

"In the future, I want to build solar panels in the rural areas of the world. Along with that, I want to make lunar solar and kinetic rain energy popularized. If possible, using perovskite solar cells could work out. How can I accomplish all of this?",environment,"As you can see, I have some pretty ambitious plans. I will explain each one in depth so you can tell me your suggestions as to how I can accomplish these goals. First off, I want to build solar farms in the rural areas of the world. More preferably, the parts of the world that receive the most sun. Places that would be ideal (I am not saying these places receive the most sun; They’re just ideal places) include western China, the Sahara Desert, deserts in Australia, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Mexico, and India. Now, I know I would need a lot of funding which I think would be possibly to receive. I know that solar farms exist and all, but building systems where there aren’t any currently could attract funders. I would also like to make these farms better than the rest and make it so each can have high capacities of MW. The most in the world right now is 1,547 MW. I would aim for 2,500 at least on each farm. Keep in mind the solar industry is really just getting started and won’t become huge until a few more years in the future. I predict we will see a big boom in solar sometime throughout 2025-2030. It will be like the technology boom but maybe not as big. I just know something is coming. That’s my prediction though. Secondly, I mention lunar solar. Now, lunar solar is a very interesting concept. “Lunar Solar Power (LSP) arrays would receive higher energy density from sunlight than we get through Earth's atmosphere, avoid weather, and could beam energy to any part of Earth facing the moon.” - Discover Magazine. So, basically putting solar panels in orbit and transmitting the energy back to earth by using either laser power or microwave power, solar panels in space could solve the problem of solar energy not working at night (and during rainy/cloudy days) and could produce extra power for here on earth. While it could be more costly and needs to be perfected, it could eventually work well and become practical. Also, putting solar panels on the Moon could work as well and supply much energy for earth. I mention rain energy as well in my title. I’m talking about kinetic rain energy. While according to Stanford it could only supply 25% of the USA’s need at max, I still think making rain farms in highly rain prone parts of the world could work out. Once again, funding and perfecting a model for how rain could be harnessed would have to be perfected. On top of all this, I would like to use Perovskite solar cells if possible. The cells (from what I hear) would be more efficient and would be easier to manufacture. This is just from what I’ve heard. It could eventually be the future of solar cells. So, how could all this be accomplished? What are your thoughts on these ideas? ",a8ed94,self.environment,,True

How the Trumpf Stole Logic,environment,"A holiday tale by michael (also obviously Dr. Seuss) Every Us Down in Us-ville Liked Logic a lot But the Trumpf, Who lived just east of Us-ville, Did NOT! The Trumpf hated Logic! All of Logic, and each fact! Now, please don’t ask why. We’re not sure, to be exact. It could be his head wasn’t screwed on just right. It could be, perhaps, that his ties were too tight. But I think that the most likely reason of all May have been that his brain was two sizes too small. “They’re all loving their neighbors!” he snarled with a sneer. “All day they use Logic! It’s painfully clear!” Then he growled, with his small fingers nervously Tweeting, “I MUST find some way to stop Logic from leading! But, Whatever the reason, While his hair he caresses, He stood at the White House, hating the Usses, Staring down from his desk with a mean, Trumpfy frown We were getting along all over the town. For he knew every Us down in Us-ville beneath Was busy now, making plans to impeach. For, Tomorrow, he knew… …All the Us girls and boys Would wake bright and early. They’d protest with joy! And Oh!, Their collective Voice! Oh, their Voice! Voice! Voice! Voice! That’s one thing he hated. Their VOICE! VOICE! VOICE! VOICE! Then the Usses, young and old, would all live in peace. There’d be such peace! Too much peace! Too much PEACE! PEACE! PEACE! PEACE! There’d be peace on the holidays, and happy families Which was something the Trumpf couldn’t stand in the least! And THEN They’d do something That would make him frown Every Us down in Us-ville, the white and the brown, Would stand close together, emphatically doting. They’d stand hand-in-hand. And the Usses would start voting! They’d vote! And they’d vote! AND they’d VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! And the more the Trumpf thought of this Us-Logic-vote, The more the Trumpf thought, “My rein must stay afloat! “Why for two whole years I’ve dealt with it now! “I MUST stop this Logical next step from coming! …But HOW? Then he got an idea! An awful idea! THE TRUMPF GOT A TERRIBLE, AWFUL IDEA! “All I need is a scapegoat…” The Trumpf looked around. But, since scapegoats are scarce, there was none to be found. Did that stop the old Trumpf…? No! The Trumpf simply said, “If I can’t find a scapegoat. I’ll make one instead!” So he looked in the distance. And saw Thems from afar. And knew just what to do to start a new war. “I’ve got just the idea! The Trumpf jumped to his feet. And he opened his phone and got ready to Tweet. And he chuckled, and clucked, “What a great Trumpfy caper! With my Tweets and my lies, they’ll all hate their own neighbor.” Then the Trumpf shouted, “Send!” And the Tweets were sent out Toward the homes where the Usses Had no reasons to pout. THEN He loaded his phone And some old empty sacks Onto Air Force One And declared WAR on all facts. All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air. All the Usses were dreaming sweet dreams without care When he came to the first little house on the square. “This is stop number one,” the old Trumpf monster hissed And he climbed to the roof, phone and bags in his fist. Then he slid down the chimney. Fast food greased his lumps. But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Trumpf. He got stuck only once, for a moment or two. Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue Where the TV played PBS with the volume on low. “This channel,” he grinned, “is the first thing to go!” Then he slithered and slunk, looking like quite the caper, Up to the couch to swipe a New York Times paper! Clean water! And Footballs! Cannabis! Fresh food! Solar panels! Dictionaries! Health Insurance! How rude! And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Trumpf, very nimbly, Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimbley! Then he reached for his phone. And started to Tweet! “The Thems took your healthcare! They’re out on the street! Thems are different then you and they’ll soon rule the country.” He lied through his Tweets. He put it quite bluntly. Then he stuffed Logic’s helpers up the chimney with glee. “They’ll read all my Tweets! said the Trumpf, “Now just wait and see!” As the Trumpf grabbed his phone, and he started to climb He heard a small sound coming from down behind. He turned around fast, and he saw a small Us! It was a young boy, and his name was Gus. The Trumpf had been caught as the climate got hotter Gus got out of bed for a cup of cold water. He looked at the Trumpf and said, “Mr. President, please, Don’t destroy Us’s Logic, I’m down on my knees!” But, you know, that old Trumpf was so evil and snide He thought for a bit and then quite swiftly lied! “Why, my sweet little tot,” the president said, “The Thems took your Logic. They’ve messed with your head. “So I’ll ban all of Thems with my power, my boy. “And I’ll put some in cages so Logic can’t be destroyed.” And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted his head And he opened a soda and sent him to bed. And when Gus went to bed with his soda can, The Trumpf sprang to the chimney like a coward and ran! Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire! And replaced it with coal, so his friends could retire. On their walls he left nothing but NRA posters and wire. And the one speck of food He threw on the floor from his hand Was a steak from his discontinued meat brand. Then He did the same thing To the other Us houses Leaving steaks Much too gross For the other Us mouthses! It was quarter past dawn… All the Usses, slept away, All the Usses, still a-snooze When he got on his plane, Packed it up with their Logic! Their science! Their Reason! Their Empathy! Their Respect! It was simply high treason! Six hundred feet up! Up the side of Trump Tower, He rode to the top to enjoy his power! “Pooh-Pooh to the Usses!” he was Trumpf-ish-ly humming. “They’re finding out now that the Thems are all coming! “They’re just waking up! They’ve been sleeping all night “They’ll read my hateful Tweets for a minute or two “Then the Usses will rally and cry, “Trumpf was right!” “That’s a noise,” grinned the Trumpf, “That I simply MUST hear!” So he paused. And the Trumpf put his hand to his hand to his ear. And he did hear a sound rising over the snow. It started in low. Then it started to grow… But the sound wasn’t mad! Why, this sound sounded merry! It couldn’t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY! He stared down at Us-ville! The Trumpf popped his eyes! Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise! Every Us down in Us-ville, the white and the brown, Were getting along all over the town! He hadn’t stopped Logic from coming! IT CAME! His lies couldn’t stop it, it came just the same! And the Trumpf, while his Trumpf-feet paced in confusion, Looked puzzled and thought: “But I created such an illusion? “I called the news liars! I’m building a wall! “I told them a violent invasion of migrants would be our downfall!” And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore. Then the Trumpf thought of something he hadn’t before! “Maybe Usses,” he thought, “see no Logic in my Tweets. “and can’t be convinced to hate each other easily!” And what happened then…? Well…in Us-ville they say That the Trumpf’s small brain Grew three sizes that day! And the minute his brain understood empathy, He stopped using his phone as weaponry And he brought back their media! Thems in cages would be released! And he… HE HIMSELF…! The Trumpf would call for some peace!",a5unbc,self.environment,,True

"Trump signs farm bill that backs climate change programs, avoids food stamp cuts",environment," President Trump signed the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill on Thursday to the cheers of environmentalists, who praised its creation of a new multi-million dollar climate change program. Trump signed the long-awaited agriculture measure, saying it was a 'great bill' that was difficult to pass — but had to be passed to support ranchers and farmers. The $867 billion farm bill provides billions of dollars in aid to farmers while avoiding cuts to the federal food stamp program that some members of the GOP sought to slash. The environmental community praised the bill's passage for slightly different reasons, pointing to the inclusion of a new climate change pilot program to help farmers deal with the effects of climate change. The bill provides $25 million per year to begin 'conservation innovation' trials for a soil rotation pilot project to help farmers improve soil health while lowering greenhouse gases that are blamed for global warming. &#x200B; ",a8a371,self.environment,,True

I think I know a way for people to have more faith in this cause.,environment," If historically people were so willing to give themselves for their nation, why do not we invent a nation on the Internet whose ideals and values are environmentalist? Let's play a little. In times of crisis one goes by crazy branches and unorthodox solutions. &#x200B; Traduced with Google Traductor. &#x200B; But for you to understand, I am going to give an introduction to the bases of the plan. I have realized that the human being does everything in order to follow his deepest beliefs. Faith moves mountains. The problem of solving climate change is that it is too far from everyday life, so people lose their faith in the cause and do not change their habits, or even do not even believe that it exists. They do not feel identified with a global community, instead they feel identified with their nations (something I respect a lot and in fact I myself very much attach myself to the national values ​​and traditions). The idea is not that they abandon their nationalist faith as many believe the solution is, the idea is that they feel their faith in their nation and a new global cause but equally present in their imagination: create a nation without territory or government in Internet with which people from all over the world feel identified, a great abstract global entity, and be driven to follow their ideals. This artificial nation will need several of the requirements that define a nation, as a culture of its own (in it we will set environmental goals, how to carry out an action every week or month). 'A large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular state or territory' (Oxford definition of 'nation'). The difference is that this 'particular territory or state' is Internet. Once people feel identified with this global entity that we have created, they will be driven to act according to their ideals. Of course I was inspired by Kekistan. People will see it fun and act accordingly. &#x200B; A somewhat ethereal and abstract creation, but it will be a social engineering for the better. &#x200B; Any ideas on how it will be? It must also have a history, even if it is invented. &#x200B; Then we will put a docx file in Internet Archive with the total description of the nation (name, flag, history, etc.), but meanwhile you can work here: . &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; PD: Warning so that this does not cause rejection in the common people: \_No impose their ideals through the laws. \_Do not bother those who do not want to join this cause. \_Do not use this for political purposes.",a3w1wb,self.environment,,True

It will take at least 70 years for that dark orange color to replace all the other colors on the graph, according to Vaclav Smil. By looking at this graph, that doesn't seem like much of a stretch.  **Emissions** 2007 = 300 Gtons/yr 2017 = 334 Gtons/yr Growth = 10%/decade  Source: BP 2018 Energy Review, page 49 **Runaway Tipping Points = Runaway Mass Extinction** Every 10 years = 14% energy growth + 10% emissions growth. Many scientists agree with Claire Fyson: We must reduce energy emissions 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 1.5 C. Many scientists agree with Stefan Rahmstorf: We must reduce energy emissions 100% in 20 yrs to avoid 2.0 C. Hans Schellnhuber says that cascading runaway hothouse begins when 5 major tipping points are triggered between 1.5 - 2.0 C. Cascading only means the triggering of more than one tipping point.  Energy emissions/demand are growing between 10-14%/decade They must decrease 50%/decade for life on earth to continue. Our whole world depends on annual growth of 2% per year. Your job, your bank, your pension, your government all depend on growth. We have 3 weeks of riots in France over gas prices. People in the country can't afford higher gas prices, like people in the city can. **Water** Water shortages could affect 5bn people by 2050, UN report warns  By 2020 about 30-40% of the world will have water scarcity, and according to the researchers, climate change can make this even worse.  With only 7% of the world’s freshwater, China plans to produce 807 million gallons a day from desalination by 2020, roughly quadruple the country’s current capacity.  By 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will live in areas plagued by water scarcity, with two-thirds of the world’s population living in water-stressed regions.  There will be about 1 billion more mouths to feed worldwide by 2025 and global agriculture alone will require another 1 trillion cubic meters of water per year (equal to the annual flow of 20 Niles or 100 Colorado Rivers).  UN studies project that 30 nations will be water scarce in 2025, up from 20 in 1990.  According to the U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security, by 2030 humanity’s “annual global water requirements” will exceed “current sustainable water supplies” by 40%.  The global middle class will surge from 1.8 to 4.9 billion by 2030, which will result in a significant increase in freshwater consumption.  Water demand in India will reach 1.5 trillion cubic meters in 2030 while India’s current water supply is only 740 billion cubic meters.  If current usage trends don’t change, the world will have only 60 percent of the water it needs in 2030.  By 2035, the world’s energy consumption will increase by 35 percent, which in turn will increase water use by 15 percent according to the International Energy Agency.  By the year 2040 there will not be enough water in the world to quench the thirst of the world population and keep the current energy and power solutions going if we continue doing what we are doing today.  The number of people living in river basins under severe water stress is projected to reach 3.9 billion by 2050, totaling over 40% of the world’s population.  Compared to today, five times as much land is likely to be under “extreme drought” by 2050.  Feeding 9 billion people by 2050, will require a 60 percent increase in agricultural production and a 15 percent increase in water withdrawals.  Water demand is projected to grow by 55 percent by 2050 (including a 400-percent rise in manufacturing water demand).  By 2050, 1 in 5 developing countries will face water shortages (UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization).  Between 2050 and 2100, there is an 85 percent chance of a drought in the Central Plains and Southwestern United States lasting 35 years or more.

An unprecedented trial sentences argentinian agricultural producer to reforest 11 thousand hectares with 120 thousand trees per season,environment,"This is a plot of land in the Department of San Martín, for which agricultural producer Juan José Karlen was convicted of 'judicial disobedience' in an unprecedented ruling in Argentina. The sentence, promoted by the criminal prosecutor Pablo Cabot, was followed by a civil lawsuit worth millions which, after a complex conciliation approved by Judge Claudia Yance, will now allow the total recovery of the devastated forest. &#x200B; The reforestation plan agreed with Karlen is part of international trends that seek ecological and social effectiveness in environmental recompositions. The conciliatory project, reviewed and homologated by the Civil Court of Tartagal, in charge of Judge Claudia Yance, is the result of a long and complex conciliation between the defendant and the Attorney General's Office. &#x200B; In the agreement, Karlen ceded his agricultural claims over the 11,000 hectares clandestinely cleared (an area equivalent to half the size of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) and agreed with the Attorney General's Office on an environmental recomposition plan that will cover the entire farm and extend over time for 30 years. &#x200B; Among other objectives, the plan includes a nursery with 120,000 specimens per season, which will be used to afforest the devastated forest. It is estimated that between 200 and 245 native trees will be planted per hectare, as well as an important investment in social matters, which includes members of aboriginal and Creole communities. &#x200B; It also establishes that if the agreement is violated, the farm will be affected until its total natural recomposition as a private protected area. &#x200B; It should be remembered that expert studies had determined that the forest on the farm, prior to clearing, had an 'Arboreal density of 245 specimens per hectare and a Basal Area of 10.7 m2/ha. Considering these parameters and with respect to the reference values of the Western Chaco Forest (Balducci and Eliano; 2012), it can be said that it was classified as GOOD'. &#x200B; Conciliation &#x200B; The unprecedented proposal for environmental recovery in Argentina was achieved within the framework of the conciliation process that the judge opened, as required by the Civil Procedure Code, after the six-month conditional prison sentence imposed on Karlen for the crime of judicial disobedience. &#x200B; The criminal process initiated after an administrative fine that has now been judicialized was promoted by the then criminal prosecutor 1 of Tartagal, Pablo Cabot. The criminal sentence, meanwhile, was dictated by Judge Azucena Vázquez of Chamber II of the Trial Court on October 2, 2015. &#x200B; The unpublished condemnation in environmental legal matters in the country regarding illegal deforestation was followed by a civil lawsuit against the landowner, a process that was left in the hands of the Attorney General's Office and the Civil Prosecutor's Office of Tartagal. &#x200B; The figure demanded, estimated at 171 million pesos, arose from an environmental study in order to achieve the repair of the cleared land, which was carried out by technicians from the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Fiscales (CIF), the Dirección Nacional de Bosques, the I.N.T.A.

Sun in a Box: Scientists Discover New Ways to Store Renewable Energy,environment,"Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a system that restores renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and is able to deliver that energy back into an electric grid as needed. The new design, which is conceptual at this point, gathers excess electricity from solar or wind power and stores heat in large tanks that are filled with a white-hot molten silicon. The light from the silicon is then converted into electricity upon demand. Because of this, the new design, described in a study published yesterday in the Energy and Environmental Science journal, would dramatically cut costs on lithium ion batteries, which are the current method for storing renewable energy. Similarly, the new design would cut the cost in half on pumped grid-scale hydroelectric storage, which is presently the cheapest form available. “Even if we wanted to run the grid on renewables right now we couldn’t, because you’d need fossil-fueled turbines to make up for the fact that the renewable supply cannot be dispatched on demand,” said Asegun Henry, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. “We’re developing a new technology that, if successful, would solve this most important and critical problem in energy and climate change, namely, the storage problem.” The researches initially set out to find a way to increase efficiency for concentrated solar power – a type of renewable energy. Henry and his team added an extra step to the conversion of light directly into electricity. Their design converts light into heat first, and only then into electricity. “The reason that technology is interesting is, once you do this process of focusing the light to get heat, you can store heat much more cheaply than you can store electricity,” said Henry. The published article describes the process as the following: the heat is stored in large tanks containing molten salt, which can be heated to 537 degrees Celsius. When the demand for electricity arises, the hot molten salt is put through a specialised machine called the heat exchanger, where the heat becomes steam. Then, a turbine converts steam into electricity. Henry says that while the technology itself is not new, “the thinking has been that its cost will never get low enough to compete with natural gas. So there was a push to operate at much higher temperatures, so you could use a more efficient heat engine and get the cost down.” The problem was that heating the salt to extreme temperatures would result in a corrosion of the tanks that stored them. The researchers then focused on materials that could handle higher temperatures. They chose silicon, as its easily available and can easily handle temperatures of more than 2,204 degrees Celsius. The next step was developing the pump that could withstand the heat from pumping liquid silicon through a new renewable storage system. They succeeded, and the pump they developed has even been noted in “The Guinness Book of World Records.” The next step in the design was to develop a full energy storage system that would use this pump. The new system the researchers have described in their conceptual paper is called the TEGS-MPV, the Thermal Energy Grid Storage-Multi-Junction Photovoltaics. The proposal is to convert electricity generated by sunlight or wind into heat via joule heating, a process by which an electric current passes through a heating element. The applicability of the design is in that it can combined with the renewable energy systems that are in existence, to capture excess electricity during the day and store it for later usage. Henry cites a small Arizona town that partly uses electricity from a solar plant. “Say everybody’s going home from work, turning on their air conditioners, and the sun is going down, but it’s still hot,” Henry said. “At that point, the photovoltaics are not going to have much output, so you’d have to have stored some of the energy from earlier in the day, like when the sun was at noon. That excess electricity could be routed to the storage system we’ve invented here.” “One of the affectionate names people have started calling our concept, is ‘sun in a box,’ which was coined by my colleague Shannon Yee at Georgia Tech,” Henry says. “It’s basically an extremely intense light source that’s all contained in a box that traps the heat.” For the project to come to life, researchers say that they first needed to develop tanks that are thick and strong enough to insulate the molten liquid within. “The stuff is glowing white hot on the inside, but what you touch on the outside should be room temperature,” Henry says. Henry proposed graphite for the tanks, although there was risk of corrosion when graphite reacted with silicone. That possibility was tested, and the researchers found that corrosion does not happen. “It sticks to the graphite and forms a protective layer, preventing further reaction,” Henry says. “So you can build this tank out of graphite and it won’t get corroded by the silicon.” The researchers also found a solution for preventing leaks by using grafoil, a type of flexible graphite that can act as a high-temperature sealant. “Innovation in energy storage is having a moment right now,” says Addison Stark, associate director for energy innovation at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and staff director for the American Energy Innovation Council. “Energy technologists recognize the imperative to have low-cost, high-efficiency storage options available to balance out nondispatchable generation technologies on the grid. As such, there are many great ideas coming to the fore right now. In this case, the development of a solid-state power block coupled with incredibly high storage temperatures pushes the boundaries of what’s possible.” The research is promising: Henry and his team estimate that a single storage system can power 100,000 homes by renewable energy only. What’s more, the system can be used anywhere in terms of geography – unlike the current hydroelectric pumps, that need to be near waterfalls and dams. “This is geographically unlimited, and is cheaper than pumped hydro, which is very exciting,” Henry says. “In theory, this is the linchpin to enabling renewable energy to power the entire grid.” Photo credit: MIT Source: ",a3nz22,self.environment,,True

6 times the environment won in 2018 | Grist,environment," It’s been a big year for clean energy pledges. The Sierra Club’s Ready For 100 campaign encourages cities to go 100 percent renewable and tracks their progress over time. Since the campaign was established in 2015, 102 cities have joined — and 45 of them, plus Washington, D.C., signed on this year alone. Cincinnati, Denver, and Minneapolis are among the trailblazers paving the way for a greener planet. Many of these cities are aiming to make good on their clean energy promises by 2030 or even earlier! That’s a pretty big deal, especially considering that the Trump administration decided to opt out of the Paris Agreement. It’s pretty clear that local leaders across the U.S. are still committed to the goals laid out in that landmark accord. We wrote about one standout on this list back in May: Abita Springs, Louisiana. The town’s Republican mayor, Greg Lemon, is among a growing wave of conservatives who believe renewable energy and their party’s values actually go hand in hand. He’s a champion of solar-powered street lights, energy efficiency, and sustainability. He’s also against fracking, something that puts him at odds with the town’s two fossil-fuel powered utility companies. Sounds like Lemon is making lemonade out of climate lemons.

"Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Waste Plastic?",environment," Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China. To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world. It is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it. The Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total. However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad. **Selected Sources** ",a6ch3t,self.environment,,True

There is so much incredibly valuable content here, definitely check it out and PLEASE support them if you are financially able to. :)  - subscribe to their channel and hit the notification button so you get notified when they upload new webinars. From the email: >Three years ago Raleigh and I created Sustainable Design Masterclass to shorten the distance between people out in the field and people that wanted to be. There were too many unknown success stories, and I thought we could spread their good news. >We have had some amazing people on our show: folks like Tony Rinaudo who just won an alternative nobel prize for his work on FMNR. Nicolas Netien, who produces the world’s healthiest olive oil (and has for the last three years) in the Cyprus desert. Rebecca Burgess, the founder of fibershed working with multinational corporations to create regenerative textiles. It's been a good ride. >At this point, we are considering letting Sustainable Design Masterclass go; we have been able to pay for our software costs, but not for our time, and both of us have big projects we are pursuing. However, before we make a final decision, we are going to try something new. >We are releasing all of our previous webinars on youtube. It is likely you have only seen a fraction of our webinars, and while our production quality has not been awesome, the content has been remarkable. And it seems a shame that we have had them squirreled away behind a paywall. >Worst of all, because we were operating through Vimeo, we couldn’t see who our subscribers were.

Otherwise, we will just have one of the most inspiring and educational youtube channels ever.** >Are we offering you anything extra if you choose to participate?

With only 7% of the world’s freshwater, China plans to produce 807 million gallons a day from desalination by 2020, roughly quadruple the country’s current capacity.  By 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will live in areas plagued by water scarcity, with two-thirds of the world’s population living in water-stressed regions.  There will be about 1 billion more mouths to feed worldwide by 2025 and global agriculture alone will require another 1 trillion cubic meters of water per year (equal to the annual flow of 20 Niles or 100 Colorado Rivers).  UN studies project that 30 nations will be water scarce in 2025, up from 20 in 1990.  According to the U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security, by 2030 humanity’s “annual global water requirements” will exceed “current sustainable water supplies” by 40%.  Water demand in India will reach 1.5 trillion cubic meters in 2030 while India’s current water supply is only 740 billion cubic meters.  If current usage trends don’t change, the world will have only 60 percent of the water it needs in 2030.  By 2035, the world’s energy consumption will increase by 35 percent, which in turn will increase water use by 15 percent according to the International Energy Agency.  By the year 2040 there will not be enough water in the world to quench the thirst of the world population and keep the current energy and power solutions going if we continue doing what we are doing today.  The number of people living in river basins under severe water stress is projected to reach 3.9 billion by 2050, totaling over 40% of the world’s population.  Compared to today, five times as much land is likely to be under “extreme drought” by 2050.  Feeding 9 billion people by 2050, will require a 60 percent increase in agricultural production and a 15 percent increase in water withdrawals.  Water demand is projected to grow by 55 percent by 2050 (including a 400-percent rise in manufacturing water demand).  By 2050, 1 in 5 developing countries will face water shortages (UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization).  Between 2050 and 2100, there is an 85 percent chance of a drought in the Central Plains and Southwestern United States lasting 35 years or more.

Yellow jackets in France,environment,"I think we should really be paying attention to the spark of this movement, “green policy” fuel tax hikes. This kind of eco-austerity, and this similar, seemingly unbreakable obsession with “ethical consumerism” are really just excuses for more neoliberalism. Not only are things like a universal carbon tax, and fuel tax hikes essentially poll taxes, and thus rightfully unpopular, but they are also just inefficient. With 90 companies causing 2/3rds of global emissions (or 100 companies causing 70% of industrial emissions or whatever), the most effective way to stop runaway climate change (if we can) is to go after the companies. It is, for example, significantly more effective to simply ban fossil fuel cars by a certain date, than ramp up the prices of fuel. Another example is with campaigns to stop people using plastic straws, they will never EVER be as effective as simply banning the damn things. Just some thoughts have a good day.

Bipartisan climate tax and dividend bill introduced in Congress!,environment,"This is huge:  Under the bill, 100% of carbon taxes are returned to ALL US residents, with a full share to every adult and half share to every child.

The carbon tax would also be assessed on imports unless already taxed by the exporting country. Therefore (1) companies have no benefit from relocating outside the US and (2) our trading partners are incentivized to assess their our carbon tax otherwise they are losing the tax dollars to the US. The fact that the bill has 2 Republican co-sponsors is a game changer. If you think this is a good idea, please call or write your Representatives to support this bill.

Without the Sun, temperature must be 0 and below that. So it is cannot be called as Global Warming for the “warm” from the Sun we are receiving from the Universe is the same. Climate is always change since the down fall many thousand years ago. From the time human was hunting wild animals without thinking to mining metals, to the time even abusing ritual like calling rain, storm to the modern world today. The only word correct for current Earth nature is environment dying or optimistic environment self-recovery. All of you must find the cause, the real problems of the environment dying in order to able have the working harmony solution. What a joke to see UN spent 400 billion $, another stupid joke is professor from Harvard University think can use “stupid chemicals, machine” to prevent the Sun light, etc. Humans are creating using many artificial chemicals like plastic, gmos, pestisites, etc. Many nations even bury un-recyable stuffs to under the land. What if volcano erupt was try to burn all of these stupid chemicals by nature? Very possible. Now compare China vs United State about the CO2 level: China Population 4 times over, but China CO2 level only 2 times over United States. And China is the “factory of the world”, have more factories and work more than United States. If base on math, CO2 level of China suppose to be at least 4 times higher than the US base on population. The question is why? The answer is tree and natural! You need to remember the trees and some natural force absorb CO2 naturaly. You can say planet Earth have too much CO2 or have too little tree (CO2 absorber). If you want to have bigger investigate, just check the TDS (Total Dissolve Solid) or the melting point, melting temperature of all the stuffs human are using. It is just very some factual. If you want to have global ideal solution and raise awareness of everybody, you must setup bounty hunter system with minimum reward start from 1 billion dollar. It is going to show the truth about artificial chemicals, plastic, gmos and some natural replacement for plastic, concrete and everything else.

An Open Letter to Environmentally Panicked Humans,environment,"An Open Letter To Environmentally Panicked Humans **** Dear Fellow Overwhelmed Earth Lovers, In the past two years, I traveled to several beautiful countries including Costa Rica, Argentina, Italy and Spain, and have been lucky enough to experience the pristine, breathtaking beaches they possess. However, I noticed these scenic landscapes had one thing in common: plastic pollution. After returning from these trips, I became inspired to monitor my plastic consumption and to research sustainable alternatives to everyday plastic products. As a California native and a concerned citizen of the earth, I am very familiar with the hold that plastic has on society and, quite frankly, my dependence on this troublesome industrial good. Of course we would love to see the earth change for the better, however, I would even go as far to say that plastic is a beloved part of our lives even though we know that it is hurting our environment on almost every level. Letting go of plastic is difficult. I myself find it hard to imagine my life without plastic, the cleaning and upkeep of reusable products honestly seems exhausting. So, I understand that we will not solve this plastic invasion anytime soon due to the majority of the population’s stubbornness and convenient naivety. However, we can start making small changes that have large impacts on our prolonged quality of air, water, and general life on this planet. **** I began thinking about what areas of my life had become dependent on plastic and I found that it was pretty much every area. After, witnessing such undeniable proof that my use of plastic is harming animals and ruining the beautiful landscapes I love to admire, I then researched a bit more and found that there are sustainable, . The hardest part in switching from a plastic product to a reusable product is actually committing to making the switch. Yes, reusable products may take more effort. Yes, you might have to clean the cotton produce bag once a while. Yes, you might have to spend a little bit more money up front for a reusable water bottle. However, these products seem worth it when you consider that if we continue the way we are now, plastic pollution will outweigh fish pound for pound by 2050. Should you go looking into sustainable alternatives, be proud that you are even considering making these changes. You may inspire someone else to do the same thing and that’s exactly how we are going to get back to the point where there are more stars in the sky than plastic pieces in the sea. The payoff is a healthier world for you and your loved ones, for your pets and your favorite animals, and for the future inhabitants of this earth to live in and to explore.

What is the best way to offset the negative externalities from by beef (aside from asking people to abstain from beef)?,environment,"Hi r/environment! &#x200B; I own a restaurant and we're always looking for ways to make our products and processes more sustainable. (Recycling, using recycled packaging, biodegradable utensils / straws, etc.) As I expand the business I'm considering pivoting our model and implementing a social cause. This would be similar to Tom's shoes, which, for every pair of shoes purchased donates a pair of shoes to a person in need, only our cause would be related to curbing the negative environmental impact imposed by beef. &#x200B; As you may know, the methane off-put from cattle is detrimental to our atmosphere, as cows require substantial land and water use. Hamburgers are a popular item on our menu and though we already offer several vegan 'garden burger' options, we'll also be offering a plant-based meat (Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods) option to appeal to meat-lovers who want to reduce their meat consumption. &#x200B; Still, we want to do more. We recognize that asking Americans to abstain from eating beef is unrealistic, so we'll still offer beef patties. That said, we'd like to use the customer's experience to educate and leave them feeling empowered and with a clearer conscience as a result of choosing to dine with us. How? Because they'll know a portion of profits in this new social-cause approach. So, we're looking for an effort or non-profit organization which mitigates the impact we're having by selling beef. &#x200B; **This leads me to my question:** As a business pledging an on-going contribution, what would be a worthwhile effort or NPO we could donate to which is involved in efforts to help offset some of the same negative externalities from beef? &#x200B; My initial thought was to pledge 50% of corporate profits to land conservation NPOs. These organizations purchase development rights from private individuals who own precious lands important to historical or environmentally threatened habitats. (Replacing native plants and animal habitats with pavement/development is another way in which we contribute to climate change.) &#x200B; That said, I'm wondering if there's a better use of these funds which would have a bigger impact? In other words, we're looking to implement a self-imposed, backend carbon tax on our profits (no increase to the price of the product) to help curb the destructive, resource-intensive aspects associated with our most popular product. &#x200B; I made a post a few days ago which got some good feedback, but I worry was too long and complicated. I'm hoping this more-concise post will garner more feedback. Thanks for your time!",a467ge,self.environment,,True

Biomass Distribution: Humans Have Killed Off About Half of Life on Earth,environment,"By measures of biomass, human land use has killed off about half of the living cells on earth. To understand how this could be so, consider that land plants make up about 80% of overall biomass. From the article: A worldwide census of the total number of trees (32), as well as a comparison of actual and potential plant biomass (17), has suggested that the total plant biomass (and, by proxy, the total biomass on Earth) has declined approximately twofold relative to its value before the start of human civilization. The total biomass of crops cultivated by humans is estimated at ≈10 Gt C, which accounts for only ≈2% of the extant total plant biomass (17). : Deforestation and other land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58% of the difference between current and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects, i.e. land-use induced biomass stock changes within the same land cover \[like forest management and grazing animals\], contribute 42-47% but are underappreciated in the current literature. Avoiding deforestation hence is necessary but not sufficient for climate-change mitigation. Our results imply that trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for climate change mitigation.

What do you guys think of this person refuting the main-stream consensus on climate change?,environment,"## I'm referring to the pdf contained in this website.  &#x200B; first couple of pages &#x200B; FROM JESSE SKIDMORE TO RANDALL: Sorry to bring this up twice but I was anxious to hear what you would think of this. A giant corporation lied about science and got caught. By their own employees. Burn. • August 31, 2015 An amazing new trove of fossil fuel industry documents was released in summer 2015. FROM RANDALL TO JESSE SKIDMORE: Hey Jesse. Been on overload the last couple of weeks and have only looked into this superficially. What first struck me is that their work relied on computer models and were exploring worst case scenarios. Given that current computer models have failed to accurately represent what is occurring now, particularly in terms of the divergence between projections and actual global temperatures, the computer models from the 70s and 80s must have been notoriously inept at producing realistic projections of the future. I think that at least some of the scientists involved in this realized that there were too many variables to determine precisely the role of CO2 to any high level of confidence. What I see here is too typical of the fear mongers who are trying to paint a picture of some vast conspiracy to 'deny' science, when what they mean by 'science' is big government funded, officially sanctioned science that was created in pursuit of an agenda that does not allow dissent or alternate points of view. The United Nations Framework convention on Climate Change is pretty unambiguous in its mandate to the I.P.C.C. to make the case for anthropogenic climate change to the exclusion of all other factors. And given that congressional investigations have revealed that Exxon contributed only around $20 million to various groups over a decade, only some of which had anything to do with climate change, and this was the supposed primary source of funding for the nefarious 'astroturf' groups that, it is claimed, are misleading the poor gullible public, I would suggest that one consider the billions, yes billions, that the global warming zealots have received in one form or another in the same time period. There is a lot more I could say but due to constraints of time and space that will have to wait for now. I will only say that the treatment of this 'disclosure' by the pro-warming factions is a prime example of propaganda in the service of an agenda rather than an attempt to understand the reality of the situation. FROM ART GIBERT to Randall. Randall, I'm quite shocked at what I see here. Not the further accumulation of evidence that the fossil fuel industry has long been aware of and funding denial of anthropogenically-caused global warming, as this has long been obvious to anyone who understands the fundamentals of climate &#x200B; and the simple notion of gases trapping heat in the atmosphere, along with the simple fact that money corrupts. How could it not, as you once said to me. No, what's astonishing is your denial of this wealth of science and evidence of both climate change and corporate malfeasance in favor of a conspiracy theory on the part of government rather than by the mega-corporations whose monetary incentive combined with their corporate muscle simply cannot logically be denied. Boiled down to the essential analysis, your convoluted reasoning here does not withstand comparison to the available facts and information- though you may simply deny them- in short, you're wrong about this. That said, I don't dismiss the concept of government conspiracies in multiple other areas of society. RESPONSE to Art Gibert Art, at the outset of a discussion of this important issue I would request of you to provide the evidence for fossil fuel industry malfeasance of which you speak. You say “further accumulation of evidence that the fossil fuel industry has long been aware of and funding denial etc.” I would be interested if you could supply details - specifically the money trail and where it leads, which scientists received payoffs and most importantly some examples of fraudulent science funded by this money. You say that this is obvious to anyone who understands the fundamentals of climate change. Really? The potential of CO2 to influence the climate has been recognized long before Exxon funded some research in the 1980s, going all the way back to Svante Arrhenius in the late 19th century. (See On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground, The Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, April 1896, p. 237) I notice that you couldn’t help throwing in the word “deny,” as if I am denying some facts and information which you apparently presume I haven’t considered. Having now gone through the supposed scandalous documents purporting to prove Exxon’s disreputable behavior I find virtually nothing of substance. I will repeat: they funded several in-house computer studies to try and predict the long term influence of CO2 on the climate and realized what many, many scientists outside of the IPCC have realized (and not a few inside) - that the climate system is chaotic and not amenable to simple single parameter computer projections, not now and certainly not in the 1980s. They acknowledged that there could be consequences to the unrestrained addition of &#x200B; CO2 to the global atmosphere, but at the same time were confronted with the enormous complexities of integrating multiple factors that could drastically alter the outcome of their models. Your entire response to my comments is a statement of opinions. I would like to see some hard facts. I do completely agree that money has the potential to corrupt. So if Exxon’s paltry $20 million or so has corrupted climate change science how about the $7 billion+ assets raised by Generation Investment Management, which stands to profit handsomely from global warming remediation schemes such as Cap and Trade? How about the $300 million pledged by Google to SolarCity, one of GIM’s investments, in late Feb. of this year? How about Tom Steyer’s nearly $100 million to NextGen Climate, an unabashedly pro global warming group? How about the US government’s yearly subsidies of $2.5 billion to the Global Change Research Program, a giant pro warming bureaucracy? To dispel any doubt as to what their position is here is a quote from the intro to their National Climate Assessment (NCA) report: “Global climate is changing. Most of the warming of the past half-century is due to human activities. Some types of extreme weather are increasing, ice is melting on land and sea, and sea level is rising.” It then goes on to describe a litany of all the ills that are going to befall us if we don’t turn over the control of all energy production, distribution and consumption to the government. The above list barely scratches the surface of the vast complex of vested interests that stand to gain through implementation of carbon remediation measures. I have not even touched upon the billions that flow to various environmental groups that promote global warming hysteria. I’ll get back to that. The first sentence in the above NCA quote is absolutely true. Of course the global climate is changing! From your statements I would assume that you believe you have a degree of climate science education. So tell me, when has the global climate not been changing? What actual empirical evidence, independent of adjusted computer models, is there that most of the warming of the last century is due to human activities when the global climate actually began warming at the end of the Little Ice Age in the mid-19th century, nearly a century before significant introduction of fossil fuel derived CO2 to the atmosphere? Glaciers began receding worldwide in the early to mid-19th century after having grown to their greatest extent in 10 thousand years during the Little Ice Age. Throughout the second half of the 20th century they continued &#x200B; doing what they had been doing for at least a century, shrinking back from their LIA maximum. Of course, you must know this. Right? What types of extreme weather are increasing? I would challenge you to show some examples. Hurricanes? Not hardly. Floods? Not any more than has been normal throughout the centuries. Drought? We have not seen anything like some of the well-documented droughts that have occurred around this planet for thousands of years, long before we humans were driving SUVs. To this date half of all US states, that is 25 of the 50, have all-time high temperature records which were set in the 1930s and have not been exceeded since. The last high temperature record set in any US state was in Connecticut in 1995. Since 1975 only 6 other states have seen high temperature records broken. This data is directly from the National Weather Service and has been spared the endless “adjusting” such as the IPCC performs on the raw HadCRUT data in order to proclaim “the hottest year on record” (by not much more than a hundredth of a degree)− a record, I might add, that is barely over a century old, and appallingly incomplete. The statement in the NCA report that “Most of the warming of the past half-century is due to human activities” is duplicitous. This conclusion is derived from computer models that are programmed only to factor in anthropogenic effects, specifically CO2, to the exclusion of other possible variables, including the Sun - computer models designed to confirm the pre-ordained conclusion that humans are causing irreparable and disastrous global warming, oh, excuse me, “climate change.” Are we seriously supposed to believe that complicated natural variables that have driven extreme climate change over and over again, long before a significant anthropogenic influence, have suddenly, in the 20th century ceased to operate? Is sea level rising? Well, yes it has risen roughly 8 inches during the past century. This is about the same as the century before. It rose nearly 400 feet at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition ca 12 thousand years ago and has been fluctuating up and down ever since. Not infrequently it has stood many feet higher than present. Are we to assume that sea level would never change absent an anthropogenic influence? Now let me state for the record: It is my belief that humans ARE influencing the climate in multiple ways, not only through introduction of CO2 into the atmosphere but through deforestation, agricultural and industrial activities, and",a3enwh,self.environment,,True

Blamewarring,environment,"Fair warning, this is a cross-post. I first submitted it to r/anticonsumption. I'm posting it here and other subs I anticipate will find it relatable. I often stumble across threads that go something like this. Person A: Why are we still talking about individual lifestyle changes? 100 corporations are responsible for 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Person B: That's true, but the resource footprint of the average person in a developed country is still way too large to be sustainable, and there are pretty straightforward ways to reduce it. Plus, doing so will eliminate some demand for dirty industry. Person A: Nothing you can do individually will change anything. Corporations are the problem. Stop blaming the consumer. I've noticed this on a litany of other subs. Essentially wherever and whenever posts concerning human civilization and its ecological consequences get popular. Sometimes this formula gets packaged into a full-fledged post with a snarky meme or twitter screencap or something. There was one recently on r/socialism. Something along the lines of 'STOP BLAMING CONSUMERS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE' with a tweet from CNN and a reply. I think this is a pernicious way of conceptualizing the problem. I suspect some here will share my objections: 1) Industry does not operate in a vacuum. If demand disappears, so does the incentive to produce. This of course ignores ecocidal activity funded and operated directly by government, which can be insulated to some degree from the necessity of profitability, but a similar principle holds for the viability of governments which lose the support of their citizens. 2) There is a fine line between causal analysis and blame. The former helps to identify effective forms of action, and is thus productive. The latter is linked to external locus of control and can absolve us of the sense of personal responsibility required to make sacrifices in pursuit of a goal, and is thus neutral if not actively harmful. 3) Individual lifestyle changes are obviously a drop in the ocean, taken alone, but they are often the most effective way one can begin to address the problem. It's vastly easier in most cases to change your habits than to change the behavior of governments or corporate actors. The former is a question predominantly of initiative and self-control. The latter involves political organizing, large-scale social persuasion, civil disobedience, etc. And it's often surprising how much of an effect one can have on others simply by providing an example to follow. That's not to say it's not also productive to try to make an impact beyond yourself, but it often makes practical sense to tackle the spheres within which one actually has substantial influence first. 4) On some level, I think it's fundamentally hypocritical to claim to care about environmental issues if one is unwilling to change one's own way of life. I could go on, but you get the picture. Have others noticed this? Is anyone else concerned by it? Is it likely that this is largely just your everyday human blame-shifting/rationalization of an unwillingness to accept responsibility or sacrifice the comforts of a high-consuming lifestyle? I think that sort of thing is definitely a factor. But could any significant portion be shilling? The motivation appears plausible, in that one is less likely to change one's habits as a consumer if one believes it's a futile, meaningless effort. And finally, what are the most effective ways to push back against these ideas? How can they best be countered?",aa0m2h,self.environment,,True

"How should I make my restaurant business more sustainable? Thoughts, ideas, criticism welcome!",environment,"Hello r/Environment! &#x200B; **TLDR;** I own a hamburger restaurant but recognize how detrimental beef is to the climate. I'm expanding the business to a larger city with a more liberal population, and want to implement a more sustainable approach to the business without scaring away meat-loving customers. Along with offering plant-based garden burgers, using recycled and biodegradable containers / utensils (which we already do), I'd like to offer plant-based meats like the Impossible Burger or Beyond Meat. The idea is not to just appeal to vegans, but to use our successful establishment to educate meat-lovers on more sustainable options and invite them to consider trying these products without inducing guilt which would discourage them from doing business with us. There are cultural / political barriers on this issue which I hope to break through by taking a 'middle ground' approach; We'll implementing Meatless Mondays (discounted plant-based burgers), and a pledge of donating 50% of corporate profits to land conservation non-profit organizations (NPOs). &#x200B; So, my questions for you are: 1.) Is pledging profits to land conservation NPOs (reducing the amount of sprawl and environmental destruction) the best use if we're wanting to make an environmental impact? Would donating these funds to some other effort be more effective? 2.) As a potential customers, is this approach something you'd find meaningful enough to choose over another hamburger establishment? How could it be improved? 3.) How else can we educate and inspire without demonizing our biggest product, thus potentially causing would-be customers to feel vilified? &#x200B; **Important history / context:** Though I'd barely consider myself an activist, I've been following this sub for several years (under a different account), and have always cared about the planet. My concern has grown considerably in recent years not only due to the worsening situation of the climate and the attitudes held by our current leadership, but because after starting a successful restaurant I've learned that I've been complicit in contributing to the problem! With the recent uptick in popularity related to gourmet burger shops, the fast casual business model (provides value to customers in terms of *convenience* and *quality*, instead of *convenience* and *price* \ These type of NPOs purchase development rights from entities which own precious land, private properties which are important to preserving historical or environmentally threatened habitats. The idea is that if customers want to eat beef they still can, and ours comes will leave you with a clearer conscience. In other words, we're implementing a self-imposed, backend tax to help curb the negative externalities associated with our most popular product. &#x200B; This is different from other social cause for-profits like Tom's or Even Stevens which are more quid pro quo ex: 'Buy a pair of shoes at a marked up price, and we'll use the additional profits to give a pair of shoes to someone in need' (Tom's), or 'Buy a sandwich at a marked up price, and we'll use the additional profits to donate a much cheaper sandwich to a local food shelter' (Even Stevens). Instead, our offering doesn't promise a specified parcel of land per item purchased, but has a more evergreen corporate policy where the monetary sacrifice is imposed on individuals who aren't actively involved in daily work required to keep the place running. &#x200B; So, (again) my questions for you are: 1.) Is pledging profits to land conservation NPOs (reducing the amount of sprawl and environmental destruction) the best use if we're wanting to make an environmental impact? Would donating these funds to some other effort be more effective? 2.) As a potential customers, is this approach something you'd find meaningful enough to choose over another hamburger establishment? How could it be improved? 3.) How else can we educate and inspire without demonizing our biggest product, thus potentially causing would-be customers to feel vilified? &#x200B; Thanks for your time and input.",a3i7zl,self.environment,,True

[rant] California isn't as eco-friendly as we believe.,environment,"(TL;DR - I went to Los Angeles airport and they had no recycling bins. This is but one of many problems I've seen here that contradict the green image California has. How can I address these kinds of problems that are bigger than myself?) Rant// Yesterday, my wife and I had to take a flight from LAX and I have to say that it was probably the most frustrating and deeply angering experience I've ever had in an airport. What I noticed is that, for all of this talk about being eco friendly in CA, the is major airport did not have a single recycling bin in sight while I was there. Now, there was indeed a trash can every 10 feet, but no matter how many corners I turned, there was nothing available for recyclable materials. This was especially frustrating because the lack of bins forces you to throw away anything that you need to dispose of, *especially* near TSA. One of my main values is conservation and reducing waste and abstaining from buying unnecessary goods is at the forefront. Imagine my distaste when I just wanted a burrito but also received a plastic tray along with it. With no place else to dipose of the remains, I had to suck up my pride and toss the tray into a trash can (along with other bottles, cans, etc.). Now, California is almost always in the news for pushing the green agenda. However, in my experience, I've come to believe that California isn't really ahead of the curve at all when it comes to being green. I could go on and on about urbanization encroaching vernal pools in San Diego, excess water loss dues to over watering, the plumes of chemicals I've breathed in while visiting the central valley and more. It seems like sometimes the state pats itself on the back for simply funding research, taxing plastic bags and promoting eco-friendly businesses (which I commend them for because that's more than other places in the world are doing), but when it comes to the minor details things fall off by the wayside. Sometimes I look at the news and see that it's not worth it to get angry at these things because the green movement is being beaten down by our leaders. But then I think about the years and years of ignorance that this country partook in and just get worked up. I'm obviously not the only one to see these problems around me. Aside from lobbying, how can I address these issues that are bigger than myself? Write a letter? Lobby for conservation movements? Edit: removed some irrelevant information.

Not only do the animals suffer, the environment suffers as well since; the waste from factory farming pollutes water, land, and air in close by communities, the heavy use of antibiotics leads to increasingly resistant bacteria, methane emissions from cows leading to further global warming.

The content and style will obviously depend slightly on the person in question, but the intention will be to persuade, rouse, alarm, apply pressure and so on. My thinking is that there are many things I would like to do (spend £100m on solar energy farms across the developing world, for example), but obviously these are things I will never be able to do; however, there are people who do have the means to do big things. Politicians don’t generally have that kind of money, but they are still people with influence (and hearts). Perhaps I am too romantic, but I also think that a physical handwritten letter has a certain power to affect. But before I crack on, I need more knowledge, and that’s where I’d like your help (if you know what you are talking about). Saving the planet is a complex job; in realistic terms, what are the most important/effective things that need to be done to minimise the damage we are currently doing to the biosphere? If I am going to write effective letters, they need to have emotional persuasive power but they also need to be able to point to concrete plans of action or targets. I need to know what the very biggest problems are, and the ways in which we might hope to deal with them. Thank you in advance for taking the time to equip me with knowledge and ideas! These are some of the things I have in mind (please tell me if they are misguided): \- Curbing and reversing population increase, especially in the developing world (somehow). \- Putting an absolute end to fossil fuels across the world. \- Somehow enforce a reduction in the amount of meat produced and consumed globally. I also need suggestions of country/government-specific cases. For example, I recall recently reading that Norway was investing more in fossil fuels, and it struck me as mad that such a developed country (in a way, the most developed country!) would be pursuing something so harmful. Surely they need to be leading the way in terms of going fully renewable, and then perhaps more nations will follow. Finally, I would like to encourage you to join me in this endeavour, and start writing letters left, right and centre. If you know someone who is silly rich, I guess they are a good place to start.

It’s well understood by even children as being something you want less of. If we talked about smoke instead of CO2, scientifically challenged people might have a better intuitive sense of how smoke is slowly filling our atmosphere with byproducts we don’t want.

I've lost hope. I'm giving up on change and going into survival mode,environment,"Apologies if this doesn't fit this sub. It's my first time posting here. This will be a bit of a rant. A paragraph I read on Reddit recently really hit home for me: >I listen to conversations around me at work on mondays to hear what people around me feel is important that happened over the weekend. Mostly personal stuff or hockey, then maybe celebrity gossip or something about the weather. Very rarely politics or about the economy, and only if affects them. I’m just sitting there thinking, “we’re living through a mass extinction and our grandchildren probably won’t survive the effects of man made climate change that are going to hit this century.” I feel such a cognitive dissonance with everyone around me. It’s surreal. - u/OptimisticViolence A conversation with a colleague two weeks ago may have been the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Over lunch, he pointed out again (again, again) that I wasn't eating any meat, and smilingly added that his family had just started meatless Thursday dinners because of climate change. Same day, in the evening, I heard a radio program with a woman talking about reducing consumption for Christmas, and using wrapping paper twice. 'What's the issue?' you're maybe thinking. 'Those sound like positive small steps.' Yes, they do. *Small* steps. I hear those people talking as if their 'sacrifices' are what is necessary to 'save the planet', then I read an article about coral bleaching or 5 degree shifts or mass extinctions or the Clathrate gun and I just want to scream. The disconnect from reality just seems so utterly impossible to reconcile that I don't know what to do. And those small steps are some of the *good* things. We currently have world leaders and industry leaders denying climate change is even a thing, or simply ignoring its effects in order to focus on profits. Closer to home, I see Christmas crap being thrown out from stores and people going about their daily lives, driving to work, chowing down on roast pork, taking advantage of sales. *So few people are truly worried.* I've been a vegetarian for over 20 years. The only thing I buy for myself new is food. I haven't flown in nearly 5 years. I rarely drive. But I live in a relatively cold climate in a heated house with my family, a house that is likely much larger than we truly need. Our food often comes wrapped in plastic. My house needs to be maintained. My kids use school supplies. I'm using a computer right now. Nobody is perfect, but I'm not naive enough to think that everyone is willing to make even the sacrifices I've made. And guess what - *even that wouldn't be enough*. So I give up. I think human greed and selfishness, basically human nature, will win over all the pragmatists telling us to ditch meat and our cars while trying to implement carbon credits. Polluters gonna pollute. Most people won't care until they are choking. I just don't see a realistic scenario where everything turns out OK. A miraculous new source of infinite clean energy? Great, we'll just use more of it. Cloud seeding or other crazy solutions? I honestly don't think we're close to ready to try those solutions without serious risk of creating an uninhabitable planet. Maybe we'll be more desperate soon. So what to do now? I've been tossing around ideas with my wife over the holidays. Maybe emigrate to New Zealand or Canada. Buy a big chunk of land at least 100km from a big city. Teach our kids things like beekeeping, canning and water purification rather than violin lessons or handball. Quit our jobs (our cost of living can be ridiculously low out there). Basically go into survival mode while I'm young enough (42) to still do so, and to be able to teach my kids useful skills before shit really hits the fan (and I believe it will). Because *yes*, even here in a developed country I'm sure we'll be affected. First we'll see a few years of bad storms and hunger in underdeveloped and developing countries (hell, we're already seeing this). We'll break heat records. We'll see food prices rise. Probably soldiers protecting Europe's borders before long from more and more refugees (I believe what we've seen from Syria is a drop in the coming bucket). But eventually it will start to affect our daily lives for real. At that point, I wonder what happens to my smiling colleague and his meatless Thursday dinners. Nobody is ready for what's coming. Ho ho ho. And apologies for my English.",aadsdf,self.environment,,True
Climate Change: A fight worth fighting?,environment," TLDR: Is the fight for stopping climate change lost? How do you deal with the topic? Can the masses be mobilized and change something? &#x200B; Dear Reddit It is in anguish and with a heavy heart that I walk the streets these days. After weeks and months of studying the topic of climate change I have made a few changes in my life. I have sold my car, stopped my motorsports hobby, stopped eating red meat, and reduced other meats/fish to once a week. I try not to fly too much, against the will of my boss, I do not take advantage of next day delivery on Amazon prime and choose the long delivery times, and buying produce I am trying to not buy anything that comes from too far away. I know these changes are good. But I also know they are not enough. As I walk through streets these days, I observe people, driving cars, buying meat, shopping for plastics that most certainly come from china. This is when doubts strike me the hardest. Could we ever change if we wanted to? I have been talking to a lot of friends, family, and some strangers on social media about this. And even if the initial skepticism faded with each new fact that I brought, and their buy-in grew, I also observed stagnation. When they saw the problem, they tried to solve it. And as they did, they realized that this is not a single problem, but involves politics, economy, immigration, and others. When they inevitably failed to find a solution to a problem that engages the smartest minds of this planet, they became silent. Then hopeless. Then depressed. Then defiant, in saying that this is for smarter people to solve. Then they changed the subject. Then they go back to their lives, dealing with their own problems. I believe that one of the greatest challenges is that this enormous task falls into a period of the Self, for self-discovery, advancements, realization and happiness. It falls into a time of constant distraction, if we want it or not. From a psychological point of view, humans are not great at recognizing intangible problems, especially if they are far out. So does that mean we are lost? Personally, I believed that this is the defining fight of our age, if not our species - overcoming the focus on the self, the countless distrations, and stand up for a better tomorrow. Countless movies have been made around that topic, and now we are presented with this opportunity to act. I believed that if we could mobilize a critical mass, we can pressure governments to finally invest heavily into research, renewables, and a change of the way we live. I believed they would be able to hold corporations accountable to be ecologically responsible, even though if that meant we had to change our lives drastically, at least for now. But for we had mobilized, and were aware, we would accept it. I know great advancements have been made bringing down cost sand reducing time to market. But is it enough? If it were, the climate summit in Katowice may have presented different numbers. But with every new climate report that explains how we need to cut emissions by 2030 to avoid the big change, with every study that shows that in 2018 we increased carbon emissions globally, with each article and website that details that we are emitting magnitudes more co2 than during the last global warming 66 mio. years ago, which took over 4000 years to unfold – with each piece, and each car I see driving by, each delivery truck I see, I ask myself: is this a lost cause? I will increase my activism, and try to talk to more and more people, I would be ready to scale back my job in the name of this challenge. But is this too much to handle for our civilization? There are activists groups, and others like me, but why are still nowhere close meeting the 2030 deadline. So can we still make a turn? Do you believe that if we can communicate the problem better, and broader, than people can still change something? PS.: This is not an invitation to discuss the facts of climate change. If you still doubt that such a thing exists, please have a look at this  and specifically the first 3 videos – their angle is not to convince you of climate change, but rather they compare the current situation with anything that has happened in natural cycles before.
