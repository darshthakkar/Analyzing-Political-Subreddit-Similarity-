Are the powers of the Wisconsin governor's office and AG overly-broad compared to other governorships and AG offices?,NeutralPolitics,"The Republican legislature of Wisconsin  -Giving some appointments to the economic development board to the legislature over the governor's office. -Prevent the incoming governor from banning guns in the state capital without the legislature's approval. -No longer could a nominee denied by the state legislature serve provisionally in that office, or be renominated. -Any names of pardoned or commuted sentences by the governor could by, by request, given to the state legislature. Some changes also exist for the incoming AG: Under the newly passed measures, the attorney general would need lawmakers’ approval to settle certain suits. Also, the measures would allow legislative leaders to intervene and hire their own lawyers — in addition to the attorney general — if the constitutionality of a law were being challenged. Under the new bills, the attorney general could no longer appoint a solicitor general to represent the state in major lawsuits, and would be restricted in how he spent settlement money, which lawmakers would now oversee. ------ Tony Evers, the incoming democratic governor has stated on the bills: “Wisconsin has never seen anything like this,” Mr. Evers said in a statement. “Wisconsin values of decency, kindness, and finding common ground were pushed aside so a handful of people could desperately usurp and cling to power while hidden away from the very people they represent.” Martha Laning, the chairwoman of the state’s Democratic Party, said: 'This is as brazen as it gets, to do this after an election you don’t like.” Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the assembly, has said: “What it does is make sure we have an equal amount of power at the table.' ------- I have two questions about this: 1: Are these powers of the Wisconsin governor's office and AG overly-broad compared to other governorships and AG offices? 2: Are there any federal powers that can interfere with the rearranging of Wisconsin government?

What value lies at the top of the hierarchy of legal values in the United States?,NeutralPolitics,"*Minersville School District v Gobitis*^ that overturned it in 1943. The plaintiff challenged the requirement that children say the pledge of allegiance in public school because they believed that doing so would be equivalent to worshipping graven images; the Court ruled in favor of the school district. The latter case was foundational because it represented a shift in society's advancing understanding of the First Amendment. The justices found that after the *Gobitis* case, a wave of persecution fell upon Jehovah's Witnesses. Lynching and social ostracization became commonplace for JW's across the nation. This excerpt from Justice Frankfurter's majority opinion in *Gobitis* stated the following: >Even if it were assumed that freedom of speech goes beyond the historic concept of full opportunity to utter and to disseminate views, however heretical or offensive to dominant opinion, and includes freedom from conveying what may be deemed an implied but rejected affirmation, the question remains whether school children, like the Gobitis children, must be excused from conduct required of all the other children in the promotion of national cohesion. **We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values.** National unity is the basis of national security. To deny the legislature the right to select appropriate means for its attainment presents a totally different order of problem from that of the propriety of subordinating the possible ugliness of littered streets to the free expression of opinion through distribution of handbills. In the *Barnette* case, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote the majority opinion in light of the persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses, and similar to Justice Frankfurter in *Gobitis*, the international totalitarian regimes (the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany) of his day and the U.S's involvement in World War Two. This is an excerpt: As governmental pressure toward unity becomes greater, so strife becomes more bitter as to whose unity it shall be. Probably no deeper division of our people could proceed from any provocation than from finding it necessary to choose what doctrine and whose program public educational officials shall compel youth to unite in embracing. Ultimate futility of such attempts to compel coherence is the lesson of every such effort from the Roman drive to stamp out Christianity as a disturber of its pagan unity, the Inquisition, as a means to religious and dynastic unity, the Siberian exiles as a means to Russian unity, down to the fast failing efforts of our present totalitarian enemies. Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard... If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us. In light of this profound and sudden transformation of legal philosophy, is it possible to ascertain a hierarchy of values unique to the United States and its republican form of government; if so, what does it look like? What does this imply for other areas of American common law? ",a77mum,self.NeutralPolitics,,True
How comparable are the false statements given during the Clinton e-mail probe to the ones during the Trump-Russa investigation?,NeutralPolitics,"In response to the number of indictments coming out of the Mueller Russia probe,  that many of Trump's associates are being charged with lying to the FBI, which is something that happened during the Clinton e-mail server investigation but, unlike with the Russia probe, no charges ever came out of it. For me, this breaks down into a number of questions: 1. Is lying to the FBI the main charge against Trump associates like Flynn, Manafort, and Cohen? 2.

Is changing the definition of a machine gun to include bump stocks via executive order constitutional?,NeutralPolitics," Background info: A bump stock is a modified stock that you can fit on a semi automatic firearm, and allows the firearm to reciprocate in a way, that when combined with forward force on the front of the firearm, essentially lets the user pull the trigger very fast. It does not modify the firearm in any way, and it remains a semi automatic firearm. , despite the fact they were bought legally and the ATF ruled they were not machine gun parts. Creating new law is within the domain of Congress and interpretation of existing law is the domain of the court system. The DOJ/ATF's job is to enforce existing law, as written.

How was a federal judge able to rule the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional when the Supreme Court originally said it was not unconstitutional? What does this mean moving forward?,NeutralPolitics,"A federal judge in Texas rules that the individual mandate of the ACA is now unconstitutional because in the 2017 tax bill, the penalty for being uninsured was wiped to $0. ( The article says that the rationale beind it was that with no penalty for non-compliance, there can't be a mandate, which doesn't make sense to me because in Department of Health and Human Services v Florida (i.e. the SCOTUS case in 2011) they ruled the ACA as constitutional because the mandate penalty is considered a tax.

How is Russia able to take those Ukrainian ships with The UN Law of the Sea and The Kerch Strait Agreement in place?,NeutralPolitics,"On 25 November 2018 three Ukrainian Navy vessels (two gun boats and an accompanying tug boat) were attempting passage from the Black Sea through the Strait of Kerch and into the Sea of Azov. Prior to entering the Strait, Russian FSB border security vessels intercepted the group off the coast of Crimea, ultimately capturing the vessels and their crew- which are being held in Kerch. Russia asserts that their actions were permissible as the ships had illegally entered Russian territorial waters; however, coordinates offered in statements by both Ukraine and Russia indicate that the encounter occurred in international waters. The event has prompted Ukraine to enact martial law in border regions and restricted the entry of Russian men aged 16-60 for fear of civil unrest similar to the events in 2014 that stemmed from Euromaidan. The Kerch Strait Agreement defines the strait and Sea of Azov as historically shared waters and provide for shared use by both parties and the UN Law of the Sea contains provisions for innocent passage.

"Are there past policies, either in the US or other countries, that have that positively impacted the middle class and could be applied to the US today?",NeutralPolitics," >According to the Census, the middle class stopped earning the majority of national income in the 1980s, and fell below the share of the top 20 percent by the early 1990s. Last year, the top 20 percent earned 51.1 percent of aggregate income while the income share of the middle 6o percent fell to 45.7 percent, the lowest level in nearly one hundred years.
