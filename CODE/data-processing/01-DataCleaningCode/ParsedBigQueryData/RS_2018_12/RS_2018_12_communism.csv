"Guevara, foco, and the Bolivian Campaign",communism,"I've been reading up on Che's Bolivian Campaign. Of course the guerrilla movement in Bolivia at that time was a horrible failure that undoubtedly went downhill due to their inability to gather any type of support from the Bolivian population and peasantry. According to existing records, they never gained a single recruit from the population they interacted with. Of course there were other factors that affected this, like the Bolivian Communist Party's stubborn resistance to supporting Che's guerrilla war. However failure to gain support from the population can be agreed on to be the most important fault in the actions taken. With their failings to build up their movement that was still in its bare infancy, it wasn't hard for the capitalist government of Bolivia, and their American 'advisers' to easily beat them in both their military and propaganda struggles. Does anyone have any idea on why the peasantry refused to side with Che, and how this could be prevented? ",a2vp8w,self.communism,,True

How is this compared to communism? 2. How has the perception of communism changed in your community over your lifetime? Do you see more support or less? What do you believe is driving this? (would be good if you can name your country for these questions) 3. Do you believe your country's political system to be moving further to the left (socialism/communism) or the opposite?

DiaMat Question: Antagonistic and Non-Antagonistic Contradictions,communism,"So I was skimming the  website linked in the sidebar of /r/communism101 and noticed this entry in their glossary: “Antagonistic” and “Non-Antagonistic” Contradictions: This bogus distinction was part of the dialectic thought of the socialist countries, beginning about 1930. “Non-antagonistic” contradictions were supposed to be ones that die out without becoming more intense or destroying either side of the contradiction. Historical experience shows that this did not happen in the socialist states. Their internal contradictions became intense and destroyed the socialist system. This distinction should be rejected outright, rather than saying that all contradictions are antagonistic. What are some good readings on this subject? And what historical experience are they referencing exactly? The most prominent instance of a non-antagonistic contradiction from socialist countries would be between the proletariat and peasantry. To my knowledge, the peasantry wasn't actively attacked and destroyed like the bourgeoisie so this passage is confusing. **EDIT: Actually just came across this excerpt from an 1987 Soviet text:  ... Such essential qualitative demarcations of dialectical contradictions and social antagonism excludes the possibility of applying them to one another and spreading specific features of antagonism into the universal-general and essential, deep character of dialectical contradictions. This means that a dialectical contradiction cannot be characterized as an “antagonistic contradiction” or as a “non-antagonistic contradiction.” It is remarkable that the works of K. Marks, F. Engels, and V. I. Lenin do not contain the expressions “antagonistic contradiction” or “non-antagonistic contradiction,” to which many authors are attracted. ",aa0k5y,self.communism,,True

looking to form a consistent position on Israel-Palestine-conflict,communism,"The motivation for this post is that somebody in this subreddit just triggered the anti-Nazi subroutine in my brain, by making remarks along the lines of Palestinians threatening the 'lebensraum' of the Jews, including references to the holocaust. I basically do not accept nativist arguments for rightful owners of a place, because this is just a battle for inventing ancestor origin-stories. Palestinians have a right to live there simply because they live there and nobody ought to be displaced, and the same is true for Jews. I also do not accept claims for exceptional-ism, based from past horror. Hitler did not grant permission to Israeli forces to shoot Palestinians, when he ordered gas chambers. Adolf doesn't get to have that authority. Also Israel is not under threat from Palestinians. One side has Nuclear weapons and a professional military, while the other has tunnel-diggers, protestors throwing rocks and 'rockets' made from sugar, fertilizer and drainage-pipe that are so primitive and ineffective that the last time somebody might have considered this as a weapon probably was in the 18 century. There are more powerful rocket motors used for pyrotechnical displays. Let me add some criticism here I have seen people in this sub regarding these toy-rockets as retaliatory action, and that's fucking ridicules. At best they are a symbol of defiance, that has had some civilian collateral-damage, at worst just cyclical provocation. The usually proposed solutions revolved around two-state or one-state concepts, which is academic idealism where the material reality is that of intellectuals offering to manufacture claims of legitimacy via cultural and political rhetoric, for what ever power is willing and able to actually implement the proposed concepts. This is a dead end because it plays on the pride of 'statesmen' looking to have legacy. I think we have to dig further down and look past national, religious and ethnic identities. And start categorizing based on material reality. The state of conflict in this region is very costly, if you pictured this happening in other places, it would probably lead to economic collapse, yet somehow it continues, what is actually enabling this ?

Decaying Capitalism and Social Theory,communism,"Is it a reasonable or Marxist assertion that the premise of fascism, (i.e. given the systematic and cyclical decay of capitalism) there is an attempt to reimpose the conditions which originally led to the success of capitalistic accumulation. In other words, are constructs established primarily in early stage capitalism reimposed during decay through the mechanism of fascistic social theory? For instance, Nazi Germany sought the destruction of homosexuality as a concept, the reimposition of strong gendered roles within the family, and naturalized Eugenics.

Is it true that communists initially supported Batista?,communism,"After reading *History will absolve me* I wanted to learn more about Batista's rise to power and Cuban history pre-Castro. I couldn't find good sources, but I got some context from the wiki page on Cuban history (I know it's not the best source for this kind of thing). From what I gathered it seemed that some people thought Batista was anti-American and revolutionary, but how could anyone think that when he came to power by violently overthrowing the first attempt at government by the Cuban people without foreign influence?

"Excerpts from arguably 'the' book on socialism with Chinese characteristics, “China’s Socialist Economy” by Xue Muqiao, 1981.",communism," From the Author’s Preface: “In 1955 the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee assigned me the job of co-authoring...a textbook on political economy...titled “The Socialist Transformation of the National Economy in China” in 1959. [I] found expression in about two dozen articles and dozen of speeches [since then]. In 1978 the People’s Publishing House offered to publish a collection of articles I wrote during the period from the founding of New China to the eve of the Cultural Revolution, called “Theoretical Questions of the Socialist Economy”. This may be regarded as my first venture into the subject. During the Cultural Revolution, I spent all available time reading through the Selected Works of Marx and Engels, the Selected Works of Lenin and Marx’s Capital along with a further study of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. I tried my hand at a book entitled Questions of the Socialist Economy and rewrote it six times over the next eight years, trying to produce a textbook called Political Economy of Socialism. ...[R]evising the text showed a departure from my earlier plans to write a textbook. Instead of trying to develop a comprehensive theoretical system, I did my best to apply the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism to a study of the historical experience of China’s socialist revolution and construction as as major economic problems awaiting a solution. I deepened my understanding of the laws of motion of the socialist economy. I would like to say a few words about my principles for studying the socialist economy [I’m only listing them, rather than the full unpacking below each one for “brevities” sake]: * 1. Integration of theory with practice. * 2.Concrete analysis of the contradictions in a socialist society. * 3.The study of the socialist relations of production as a process.” Contents: Chapter I China’s Socialist Revolution and Socialist Construction 1.

Marxist understanding of the siege mentality,communism,"I grew up in a community which I would say was plagued by a , the idea that the community was under constant threat by those outside of it. We generally held a lot of resentment towards the outside society, which produced an underlying psychological state that was very hard, i.e. we shouldn’t compromise with outsiders, the outsiders’ sole mode of existence was to usurp us, everything bad which happened to us was merely a conspiracy by outsiders, you get the idea. I’ve done a little bit of research on the topic. Most populations with the siege mentality tend to be highly reactionary (American and European white supremacists, Israelis/Zionists, Hindutva nationalists, white people in Africa, etc.) in the sense that they already hold a lot of institutional power yet remain in a constant state of fear that their power will be challenged and overthrown. However, my community (Muslim-Americans primarily of South Asian and Levantine Arab nationalities) in no way held that much power (even though many were part of the national bourgeoisie back in their home countries, hence why they had the ability to migrate to the US in the first place), yet embodied this mentality to the highest degree. After 9/11 and the subsequent imperialist wars and racial profiling (I was eight years old at the time) things got way more intense since the adults really did believe the West was now “at war with Islam”, but even then the reasons for holding said mentality went far beyond this. On one hand, the feeling of being under siege has an advantage insofar as that it can motivate pretty drastic action and provides quite a bit of consciousness, a sense of extreme urgency. But, it’s also emotionally bearing and causes a lot of irrational and downright reactionary behavior (paranoia and also pretty rigid black-and-white/absolutist thinking).

Victory of the Far-Right in Andalusia,communism,"Not sure how big this is abroad, but in Spain it's been getting a lot of attention. The far-right party Vox (ironically having the same name as the progressive news site) just broke major ground in Andalusian parliamentary elections yesterday (December 2nd) going from 18,422 votes in 2015 to 395,978 votes 2018. The interesting thing is that the region of Andalusia has typically been quite left-leaning, being a very agricultural region and home of Marinaleda. Currently, the way the parliament looks, the most likely coalition is going to be Ciudadanos (center-right), PP (right), and Vox (far-right), while the Left took quite the dive despite the coalition made between Podemos, United Left, and Andalusian Left. Voter turnout was at 58.7%. Currently I do not have the data necessary to say where Vox's support is coming from, but I would not doubt that it stems primarily from the Catalonia incident, which has caused a lot of polarization within Spanish politics. The biggest question here (from my perspective) is whether this means that we, the far-left, also have an opportunity to expand (parties such as PCPA, here in Andalusia).",a2nsnp,self.communism,,True

The enlightened worker commands the value of his own labor,communism,"&#x200B; Marx deciphered for the worker class that knowledge is power, and the knowledge that we are in stages of reversals of power attaining is that labor is magic, and priceless. Vast sums of wealth are being produced by the humblest labour, and the labourers do not partake in this wealth as much as the owners, and this is natural, as ownership is a very demanding kind of labour. Most that win great fortunes lose them quickly. But the difference between the price and the value of labor is too great. I dare say this is not the case because the owners are evil, but because the workers have in general not been enlightened. Because even though we all know our time is our life and that is priceless, it is only in moments of pure inspiration and creative unfolding that we see what our labour is really worth, namely that it is not just our time, but our whole being. &#x200B; 'The enlightened worker commands the value of his own labor'; the enlightened worker commands the value of his own being. His self-value comes under his control, and his actions will resonate with the logic of power, so that they will have the consequences one intends, because he values the things that are indeed valuable to him; that is enlightenment. Not to know that all values are relative in general, but to know that values are relative to ones own true nature. This knowledge pushes the worker to be precisely aware of what she is working at. And this in turn will bring about the enlightenment of the Proletariat. There is no Party to take control of the means of productions, there are only enlightened workers in control of their own labor, meaning; workers with a purpose. ",a2wpgo,self.communism,,True

I have read all the major works of marx, engels, lenin, stalin, and mao so I'm not looking for suggestions to read 'on contradiction' or anything. I have a decent understanding of Mao's ideas (mass line, people's war, new democracy, etc). I'm looking to better understand MLM as a developed theory. At the moment MLM seems very ultra-left to me, although that may just be the maoists in my area. If there are any texts that can address that concern as well, I'd appreciate it. Also, there seems to be an obsession among the maoists in my area with identity politics. Is this normal, or are the maoists in my city just oddballs?

On the so-called 'Russigate' scandal,communism,"I just wish 'Russiagate' would go away, but it just escalated again and again it's tried to throw progressive groups like Black Lives Matter and my own party PSL under the bus, so here we go. Russiagate peddlers and observers, please read. Most importantly the Russiagate narrative has been used as a political cudgel against so so so many perfectly unaffiliated people and groups including: Black Lives Matter, my own party PSL, Jill Stein, Bernie Sanders, and this poor Maria Butina woman who is very obviously not a spy and was simply broken by her dreadful treatment by authorities over the last months of her detainment to get her to plead guilty ever since her detainment in JULY. We're at the stage now where people are essentially being tortured to satisfy the Russiagate narrative - Butina has been through a great deal of deeply sexist treatment. It's a long ridiculous and sordid list of scapegoats. This is not about 'protecting democracy' or any such thing, this is about salvaging an increasingly weakening US regime - because Trump does suck at managing the affairs of capitalists, especially the financial imperialists, which the president is supposed to be good at - and if you keep that in mind this whole circus makes a lot more sense. It's even become a cottage industry, there's a lot of money to be made by producing media about this. It all too perfectly suits this political project to prop up the CIA, FBI, NATO, the so-called 'rule of law'*, and even sometimes Wall Street as our saviors and fuck that 1000%. Just take a look at Robert Mueller's history and the role he played for George W Bush post-9/11. Why are progressive people expected to support this at all! Not to mention the core evidence of the story just doesn't add up. Hillary Clinton lost an election she could have easily won except that she sucks, her campaign sucked, and the electoral college is archaic bullshit that makes gerrymandering effective. Trump lost the popular vote by about 3.5 million votes. Any claims of Russian (btw does this mean Putin, the Russian government in general, powerful Russian financial interests** (power relatively to Russia anyway, nothing near the United States), or just Russian people? I'm pretty sure we're just supposed to be xenophobic toward everything Russian now) meddling rests on extremely flimsy (if I'm being charitable) evidence. The Internet Research Agency (IRA, lol), the infamous 'Russian troll farm,' spent a whopping $4700 on the election, where Trump spent $90 million, not to mention all the free and wildly-greater-than-his-opponents' coverage he got from every big US media outlet, even during the primaries. The hacking thing is technologically impossible. The emails must have been taken by a leak (a hack from afar was technologically impossible), and zero evidence has been presented that the leak - which is not even talked about, for popular US media it was a hack - had anything to with Russia. A lot of the evidence, including some of that IRA spending, that's supposed to point to election meddling happened after the damn election was over. Michael Flynn asked Russia to support a pro-Israel measure once Trump was president-elect, I forget the exact issue - again, after the election. That's supposed to be Flynn's aiding in Russian collusion... forget Israeli collusion, apparently! Also remember if we impeach Trump, we get Pence. Seriously consider whether that would be any better than Trump or if it's worth drooling over Rachel Maddow's empty speculation. What exactly is to be accomplished by all of this for progressive people? The story itself is bullshit, and more importantly it's utility actually serves interests to the political right of where Trump is on those issues. Most of what Russiagaters of all classes and types want out of this seems to inevitably lead to WWIII via even further provoking Russia. Also China, but that's for another post. *I want to be clear that 'lock em up even if it's a charge for something unrelated to Russia because fuck em' - they are all of course bad people - i.e. essentially the 'left'-tacking rule-of-law argument is a fine thought before you consider it's implication. 'Fuck em lock em up' is a dangerous precedent, especially in the US! for everyone when it doesn't have to actually fit any kind of logic whatsoever. **I used 'powerful Russian financial interests' because I refuse to use the word 'oligarch,' because of a photo I put in the comments below. The definition was changed to include the Russian part recently, i.e. after the 2016 election. Take a look at the global economic and financial positions of the US/it's closest allies and of Russia and tell me the US and a great number of other countries don't deserve to occupy that place in that definition over Russia, if we even have to include a particular country at all on a damn google search for 'oligarch'",a7llpo,self.communism,,True

There was a day when the Lincoln Brogade fought fascism in Spain, but they are gone now; there was a day when anarchists took their fight to Haymarket, but they are gone now; there was a day when fathers, sons, and more fought off the world's strongest military in a glorious revolution gone terribly awry in the later years. I want to believe in the revisionist future the CPUSA preaches, that we don't need arms we need votes, that we don't need revolution we need reform, but its feeling more and more like now is the time to take up arms because decades since the last people's revolution these passive aggresive protests got us no where. There is no reform occuring only entrnchment of our two party system. On one side of no man's land we have the democrats, bourgeoisie who pretend to care; on the other side bourgeoisie who are open about their price and apathy. Then there is us, the proletariat, the silent majority stuck right here in the middle waiting watching. Nationalists, aware or unaware of their position have begun acting as an auxiliary military force, yet the proletariat have no defenses no dug in position, no vanguard. I love the constitution and the power it gives to states and to citizens, but the reigns of power no longer belong to us, and both sides are trying to take away everything that remotely resembles freedom, when will the vanguard return to be champions of the proletariat.

The Future?,communism,"Hello folks! There has been something that has been repeatedly wracking my mind, and I wanted to rant a bit in the vector of Reddit. There may be some questions tossed in here, please comment or answer at your leisure :) So, story time. Some years ago, I achieved a semblance of class consciousness after a series of experiences demonstrated to me the political/social/economic illnesses the USA suffers. Paired with a voracious reading appetite, this subreddit, a lot of books that would make Sean Hannity’s head literally explode, and a desire to change our society for the betterment of everyone and *ouila*, next thing I know, I’m emailing the CPUSA and meeting two Party reps at a local Starbucks (the irony of this meeting place did not escape me lol) We have some lovely conversations about the current state of affairs in 2017 American politics, discuss the plight of local workers, the political goals of the Party’s chapter, some leftist literature, and the times and locations of local meetings. I never went to the meetings and stayed a ghost despite paying dues and being a member. Now, I’m quite sure that I am past my dues and am probably no longer a member. Allow me to explain myself...I have no excuse, comrades, other than shameful fear which I feel I must confess. As a veteran, I once claimed a clearance (my job did not deal with anything crazy - just maintenance on equipment lol I never had the backup codes to the Football XD ) which was quite low. I knew that joining the Party would likely annihilate keeping that clearance (not that it matters, I don’t plan to work for the government in any capacity in the future for obvious reasons) but I didn’t care. My criticism of the US Government, while radical in nature, is most decidedly out of love, and never born out of a desire to commit an act of violence or terror. I would love nothing more than to see a peaceful revolution brought about via our “Democratic” traditions. In truth, comrades, I am a lukewarm leftist because I am afraid. I am afraid what will happen to Marxists (and those who claim to be either by personal predilection or by partisanship) in the future at the hands of an unpredictable government, which I view as a product/tool of Capitalism which chiefly serves the privileged Bourgeoisie. I see the resurgence of Marxist, and therefore anti-Marxist rhetoric reviving among the youth, especially on college campuses. I fear that the days of blacklisting, imprisonment, etc of Reds (whether they actually are or not) will come soon, and we shall see comrades persecuted unjustly again in the US, *en masse*. I don’t want to be labeled a coward although I must admit I am afraid. Just because things get a little “dicey” does not mean one should abandon their principles. However, would you keep your political predilections public (or at all, for that matter) were you threatened with persecution by the government for your beliefs? I would like to hope I would, and that the American public would see this as a grave injustice. (I can hear conservatives now: “Tell me more about how you believe in *individual freedoms*” smh lol) Imprisonment (or worse) is just what would happen to me; my wife is assuredly not a leftist (much to my dismay but she’s still a keeper haha) but what if she was affected by how I vote, view national and international history, partisan affiliation, etc.? What if she lost her job like some did in the past despite not even being leftist? What if my future children are affected? What if my family members like my parents or siblings were affected; they have their own lives and political affiliations separate from mine as well. In reality, the majority of my family has no idea what I believe politically speaking, as they are staunchly conservative. I want to protest, to get out there and have my voice heard...our voice. My tears flow Red as I lament my inadequacy; Yet what I fear most is the Red which will flow in the streets, winding through the cobblestones and bricks like the network of lies we unwittingly choose to embrace.

Opinions on stance toward the military,communism,"I am German and since the German military stopped using the draft to recruit soldiers for their imperialist wars in 2011 they have relied on professional soldiers and on voluntary recruits. In the history of the German anti-war movement the communist party had the line of basically encouraging leftists to join the army and to do political work there. This is in line with thinking that if a revolutionary upheaval happens we need soldiers to revolt and point their guns at the right people. Well even granting that this was a viable political line back in the day when the draft still existed due to the fact that a lot of soldiers didn't really want to be in the army but had to some still hold this line, encouraging people to join the military because 'we need good people in the army'. I consider this to be a severe underestimate of the institution of the bundeswehr and also encouraging proletarians to go and kill people in the middle east and Africa just seems not right.

By easing and understanding the world through a materialist lens, I’ve been able to better leverage my labor power to advance my economic situation. I have a much better job and am on an upward trajectory career wise. Because I’ve worked on liberating my mind from oppressive bourgeois constructs, I’m able raise my kids free from misogyny and racist beliefs. The extra income I’m receiving has allowed me to help local comrades agitate and organize for the working class. A better world is possible.

"William Blum, indispensable critic of US imperialism, passed away today.",communism," Coincidentally, my reading group is reading the introduction and a few chapters of *Killing Hope* this weekend. The introduction is one of the best introductions to anti-imperialism I’ve read and this quote specifically helped me finalize the shift from anarchist to ML: >The boys of Capital, they also chortle in their martinis about the death of socialism. The word has been banned from polite conversation. And they hope that no one will notice that every socialist experiment of any significance in the twentieth century – without exception – has either been crushed, overthrown, or invaded, or corrupted, perverted, subverted, or destabilized, or otherwise had life made impossible for it, by the United States. Not one socialist government or movement – from the Russian Revolution to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, from Communist China to the FMLN in Salvador – not one was permitted to rise or fall solely on its own merits; not one was left secure enough to drop its guard against the all-powerful enemy abroad and freely and fully relax control at home. >It’s as if the Wright brothers’ first experiments with flying machines all failed because the automobile interests sabotaged each test flight. And then the good and god-fearing folk of the world looked upon this, took notice of the consequences, nodded their collective heads wisely, and intoned solemnly: Man shall never fly. -William Blum, *Killing Hope*",a4scqz,self.communism,,True

I guess technically I’d be considered a Trotskyist, since I believe in permanent revolution and find the USSR extremely problematic, but I personally prefer Marxist or Marxist-Leninist, since I hold many of Lenin’s ideas (certainly 95+% of what I’ve read) so strongly. I am also a member of the ISO, so do with that as you will. I will also say that while I don’t really have much positive views of any modern Socialist states (though as the PCUSA has educated me I’ve become more sympathetic to the USSR, and could certainly could be won over to Cuba because of its healthcare and trans rights) I will admit much of it is due to ignorance) All that being said, I personally am very committed to United Front work. I remember when I worked with my ISO branch to organize a May Day event in 2016, a member of PSL organized with us and spoke at the event. We’ve also done a lot of work with a local Antifa group. And my branch has done a lot of work around abortion rights and have participated in/organized several clinic defenses, and naturally these involved many Liberals/Soc Dems. While I ultimately see Liberals being counter-revolutionary or neutral and therefore don’t rely on them, I view any Leftist group as worth working with. In the struggle, and certainly in the revolutionary period, it is vital to have numbers and to win. And my current view is that disagreements I have with Anarchists, Maoists, and other tendencies are things to deal with later. And hopefully in a proper way. We have to save bullets for the capitalists after all. So all that being said I’m interested in everyone’s thoughts. It’s no secret that this sub is certainly more Stalinist/Maoist in nature and I’ve seen the ISO be torn a new one several times. So I guess my part B question would be, despite disagreements over, let’s say potential diplomatic relations, how would you all handle my Trotskyist comrades and me? ",a2kx1e,self.communism,,True

The line between criticism and sectarianism,communism,"I've been a Marxist for several years by this point. The specifics of my beliefs have changed over time, but I've always been consistently Marxist. That said, my relationship with Leninism has been touch-and-go. I admire Vladimir Lenin, absolutely, but I've found myself in disagreement with some of his ideas and interpretations. I mention this because a lot of communists today seem to identify as Marxist-Leninists (could even be a plurality, but I don't know the actual numbers). &#x200B; Something I've noticed is that a lot of MLs tend to be more defensive of countries like China and North Korea than non-Leninist Marxists that I've also seen (not saying this in any kind of absolutes, it's just my personal observation), even when the criticism is coming from other socialists. A common critique of ML states by Western socialists is that they're 'not really socialist,' but state capitalist (or some variation thereof), which of course MLs dispute. &#x200B; Now, let me clarify that I'm not bashing MLs here--I think they do make fair points about why such criticisms can be harmful to the socialist movement overall. I also agree with showing solidarity towards socialist-identifying nations (of course), and with the basic fact that socialism will look different everywhere it's applied. Having said that, I'm also weary of offering no criticisms whatsoever--of course, it's fair to say that 'No True Socialist' isn't exactly a great criticism anyway. &#x200B; What I'm trying to say is, where do you think the line should be drawn? Obviously solidarity is important in the face of capitalist criticism (I don't think anyone seriously disputes that), but when it comes to socialists? I mean, should criticism of Chinese socialism be left solely to the Chinese or is outside (constructive) criticism by other Marxists simply a part of solidarity? &#x200B; Personally, I'm not really sure. I used to agree with the 'not socialist, state capitalist' crowd, but over time I've come to see the flaws in this, so I'm trying to decide my position.",a6ma8p,self.communism,,True

Some thoughts I have been having about why revisionism was inevitable . What do you guys think?,communism,"I have been thinking that perhaps revisionism was inevitable, especially in China. These are some of the reasons why I think so: 1) Just look at the steel production of China in 1976 it was just 21,000 tons per annum while Poland which had a much much smaller population had an output of 17,000 tons . That gives 0.00049 tons per capita for Poland and 0 .000024 tons for China. Thats a 20 fold difference. How could China compete with that kind of backwardness? 2) After the Sino/Soviet split, where would China get modern technology to improve its productive capacity? Just look how the US is trying to destroy Huawei and ZTE right now. Even now there is a ban by the US for exporting lithographic technology to China, so that China doesn’t become self sufficient in making computer chips. Would China redevelop or reinvent everything, that’s hardly realistic. The soviets had industrialised by exporting grain and buying technology from the West, they were blessed enough to exploit the largest capitalist economic crises to date ie the Great Depression. Western companies were hungry for orders because the western markets were in the depths of a depression. There was no such crises in the 1970s. Besides in the depths of the Cold War and having just lost in Vietnam would America had allowed history to repeat it self? Also all other countries like the US, Japan and South Korea all industrialised by importing capital from abroad. The Soviets were the exception. 3) The US and its allies, were in a much better position. They had a long time to develop, Britain financed all of its industrialisation by colonial plunder, they were growing even richer each passing day by exploiting all the third world by unequal exchange, imperialist plunder, FDI returns etc. Plus the US mainland was not touched by any of the World Wars unlike China. How could China remotely compete with Imperialism in such a situation? 4) The more China would fall behind, the more the populace would ascribe the failure to develop to socialism rather than on Imperialism. The intelligentsia might see Japanese and South Korean development and would start favouring capitalism. The CCP would have had lost power, a colour revolution financed by the West would have had more chances to succeed (Tiananmen Square).. 5) After the Volcker Shock, when the rate of profit precipitously declined in the west, Imperialism became even more vicious. This is when Neo-Liberalism starts and also when the US went on an orgy and assassinated many third world socialist leaders ( Sankara, Allende, Bhutto etc). Perhaps Imperliasm might even had directly attack China, or attempted to encircle it? Edit: This is my attempt to find material causes for revisionism. Of course I would prefer for it not to happen.

how to start to change people’s minds about communism,communism,"i’ve seen a lot of people asking about how to hook people on their lives on communism, and i had a conversation with someone recently that gave me an idea on how to do that. the person that i had this conversation with is a very socially aware high school teacher, and therefore he comes in contact with lots of kids that say and think problematic things. he told me that you can’t always get them to agree with you, but finding some middle ground is something. get them to agree on something small. how this applies to us is even though you might not be able to make someone a communist in one conversation, you might be able to convince them that capitalism is inherently oppressive and unethical or something that’s a component to the ideology of a communist.",a3rhdy,self.communism,,True
Totalitarianism as a concept isnt grounded in reality,communism,"The notion of totalitarianism where certain governments(good like USSR or bad like Hitler) control every facet of an individuals life is absolute bullshit. No government has ever done it before, and no matter how much the people like their government if its 'totalitarian' then all the supporters of the government are 'indoctrinated'. Not only is this cartoonishly stupid, it takes the responsibility away from the people for the actions done. The holocaust was done by the people of nazi Germany, but calling Germany totalitarian places the blame on Hitler and the leaders almost entirely, while in reality Nazi Germany was millions of individuals participating in the shitshow willingly for the vast majority of cases. This notion, especially when attributed to the Nazis and the USSR is excellent propaganda to support the status quo of American Empire hegemony, basically putting the United States on the pedestal of Enlightened centrism.

The Revolution Must Begin In Africa,communism,"Comrades, We are united by our hatred for the injustice we witness worldwide in the modern day. Nowhere is the pain of injustice and capitalist corruption more obvious the continent of Africa. Our comrades in Africa have endured the worst of imperialism's evil. The simplest freedom from oppression is world communism, beginning with a global revolution. In Africa, all the ingredients of a communist revolution are in place; ample weaponry, guerrilla environment, and many sympathizers of socialism/communism. The great continent of Africa has more than a billion people, more than a billion comrades waiting to be freed of the injustice of capitalism. Many problems of the 21st century, such as climate change and disease, have been directly addressed under communist states such as that of Sankara's. Comrades, if we wish to see a day where the working class is free from the tyranny of the bourgeoisie, we must begin an African revolution that will tell all: 'Proletarians of the world, unite!'",aa74i6,self.communism,,True

It began with a few sjw cringe videos being suggested on my homepage here and there and it has completely morphed into literal Nazi propaganda. I’ve had channels like black pigeon speaks and other straight up fascists recommend to me. I guess this once again shows how afraid of leftist ideas corporations like YouTube are and how far they’re willing to go to silence us and force us off the platform. ",a2kjln,self.communism,,True
