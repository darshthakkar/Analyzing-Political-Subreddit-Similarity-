Cannabis meets cyber-culture - Live Stream anarchist book launch!,Anarchism," The success of the campaign to decriminalize cannabis in South Africa will be celebrated at an innovative book launch event on 6 December. Stalwarts of the cannabis campaign Gareth Prince, Jeremy Acton and Monica Cromhout will be recognised for their contributions to the struggle for decriminalization at the launch of local writer Mike Kawitzky's book, Journey to Everywhere, which will feature a live online streaming show with the author. Journey to Everywhere is a book that is likely to enrage the anti-drug lobby as it encourages a more enlightened approach to thinking about psychoactive substances. The launch will celebrate cannabis activism because mind-altering substances form an integral part of the book's storyline. Comments Kawitzky, 'The decriminalization of cannabis is one step along the path to freeing the potential of human consciousness through the judicious use of psycho-active substances that enhance creativity. The measures towards legalization have come not a moment too soon.' Kawitzky is a former columnist for Intelligence magazine and a cyber-guru who has explored online culture in both his writing and practice in internet communications. An early adopter of internet technology, Kawitzky is a pioneer of internet streaming in South Africa and the launch will be streamed on his YouTube channel using a special set for the show. Those who want to view the online launch can do so on December 6th at 6.00 PM (GMT+2) (tomorrow)  In his book Kawitzky chronicles his adventures on the path to making an innovative movie about human consciousness called Cognition Factor. Mike's alter-ego Schwann takes the reader on a hilarious road-trip across the globe where he encounters many luminaries of science, psychedelia, cyber-culture and spirituality. They include 'magic mushroom' specialists Terrence and Dennis McKenna, the inventor of LSD Albert Hoffman, leading biologist Rupert Sheldrake, visionary artist Alex Grey and other colourful characters. The book documents the evolution of cyber-consciousness via social networking from a uniquely South African viewpoint. Says Kawitzky, 'It's a look-see into a world of psychedelics, an experiential romp with sacred madness through a desert of corporate zombification to an oasis beyond insanity.' Kawitzky's adventures range from covering solar eclipses and hanging out with the animals in the Kruger National Park to clubbing in Ibiza and attending the LSD Symposium in Basel, Switzerland. Here he met the creator of LSD, Albert Hoffman, as well as blowing the audience out of their seats with the boom of an atomic explosion in his promotional video screening. The book abounds with such quirky escapades as 'Schwann' travels to Europe on a container ship, braves the vicissitudes of uncooperative weather and tropical heat to record solar eclipses and shares cannabis spliffs with his travelling companions as he narrowly escapes death on the road in his V8 Pontiac. Kawitzky left his early career as a 'suit' in the fashion business to become a free-wheeling writer and film maker determined to live outside of the mainstream. As one reviewer wrote, 'Journey To Everywhere sheds light on the fascinating untold story of '90s counterculture, the early days of South African internet, M-Web and the cyberpunks who cobbled it all together as they went along. But it does so through a unique lens, one man's quest for enlightenment – both spiritual and digital – for himself and everyone else. Although Schwann is an everyman in some ways (i.e. he searches for meaning in life; treasures creative freedom) his openness to radical ideas and dedicated follow-through despite an uncertain destination sets him miles apart from most average people.' Journey to Everywhere is available from Amazon.com and print copies will be available at book stores throughout South Africa in the near future. Update: Due to the authenticity of this event, the live stream goes directly to 'private' when we're done. So you will not be able to view after the event.

Abstencionismo (Spanish),Anarchism,"Vaya por delante que no es mi intención hacer un llamamiento a la abstención, ni al voto. Ni evitar una u otra cosa. La intención de este artículo es desmontar la absurdez de parte de la izquierda de querer responsabilizar de sus fracasos y miserias o del ascenso del fascismo a la abstención o a no haberlos votado a ellos. Si, así son, no se cortan... Algunos sectores de la izquierda como ya saben, en la prepotencia y falta de autocrítica que les caracteriza, querían culpar a la abstención de su fracaso electoral. Que no chico, que la gente no te vota porque no se sienten identificadas con tu mensaje ni ideas, porque están cansadas de más de lo mismo, y porque te has diluido dentro de un Sistema que cada vez causa mas rechazo, y bueno, pues ¿qué esperabas si te mezclas con algo que causa rechazo?...Y encima, viendo las declaraciones y posiciones después del fracaso, siguen erre que erre, no quieren escuchar el mensaje que les han mandado... -Gracias a la abstención, hace que los resultados electorales no sean legítimos (que sí legales), es decir, gobierne quien gobierne, apoyados en quien quieran estar apoyados, gracias a una alta abstención seguirán siendo una minoría que no han contado con el apoyo mayoritario del pueblo ni de lejos. Esto no hubiera sido así si una amplia mayoría hubiera ido a votar (independientemente de a quién) legitimando a los gobernantes de turnos y todo lo que con ello puede traer. Si aceptas las reglas del juego, si las apoyas, no tiene sentido que luego te quejes porque no ha salido el tuyo. En eso consiste el juego. ¿Esto en la práctica en qué se puede traducir? Pues en que tenga más sentido tus luchas y reivindicaciones contra los resultados electorales que si los hubieras apoyado (insisto, independientemente de a quien hayas votado) pues carecería más de sentido, y además, no serías responsable de los posibles pactos post-electorales, esos que son tan habituales y frecuentes, que dejan vendidas a las oprimidas, ademas de negar casi todo aquello que prometieron en campaña. -Un resultado electoral, en las condiciones particulares del Estado Español y otros muchos sitios, nunca pueden ser legítimos, porque los que se presentan no parten de condiciones igualitarias. Si unos controlan los medios de comunicación, prensa, radio, tv,...es decir, gran parte de la opinión pública y los medios de adoctrinamiento del Sistema, son subvencionados por empresarios y bancos, hacen campañas con muchísimo dinero,...Y otras no tienen absolutamente nada. ¿Cómo puedes decir 'venga, alá, ahora a votar, y lo que salga es justo, es lo que la gente ha querido'? No, los poderosos siempre van a ganar, incluso yendo a votar el 100% del electorado, y si salen unos u otros, simplemente ha sido porque los poderosos así lo han querido, dándole cabida en sus espacios, apoyándolos,... -Cuando votas, votes a quien votes, significa que estás de acuerdo con el Sistema. Es decir, al acudir al llamamiento del Régimen a participar en su juego, y tu aceptarlo voluntariamente, estas diciendo que sí, que vas, que apoyas su juego, su sistema, sus reglas, su representación...Y conociendo las reglas de este juego, entre otras muchas cosas lo anteriormente mencionado, puede no salir el que tu quieres, y si sale, es bajo unas condiciones impuestas de antemano por los poderosos. Es decir, si decides voluntariamente apoyar y acudir al llamamiento del sistema, legitimándolos con tu voto (al sistema), luego, no es muy coherente que si no sale el que tu querías, o que si sale pero con un discurso y unas acciones muy descafeinadas y muy distantes a lo que decían anteriormente (insisto que las condiciones para llegar las ponen los poderosos y el propio sistema), te quejes. Aceptaste el juego conociendo las reglas, lo legitimaste. Es como si te invitaran a jugar un torneo de fútbol, te explican las reglas, te explican la influencia de los poderes económicos en el torneo,... tú aceptas jugar voluntariamente, y luego te quejas por no haberlo ganado. Para ser justas, también cabe mencionar que puedes votar a una opción que sus propuestas son claramente contra el sistema, es decir, en principio en la teoría estarías por un lado apoyando el Régimen al entrar en su juego con sus reglas, pero a la misma vez, rechazándolo, dando tu voto a quien es crítico con el mismo. La experiencia nos dice que esa crítica se va difuminando seguir esa opción va escalando puestos y estando mas cerca de cuotas de poder, y casi que no los culpo, porque como ya sabemos y hemos dicho anteriormente, para que te permitan alcanzar cuotas de poder, tienes que ser lo menos molesto posible para los poderosos (y no hablo de políticos sino de toda la maquinaria capitalista que hay detrás) y su gran poder tanto económico como de influencia. -Una alta abstención se puede dar por múltiples razones, y sería poco honesto achacarlo solo a lo que nos interesa. Pero entre esas múltiples razones, me atrevería a confirmar que predominan: Un rechazo a la clase política (a toda), un descontento con el sistema, con los partidos políticos,...una desconfianza hacia los mismos. La abstención en gran medida es la demostración activa, real, de darle la espalda al Sistema, a los partidos, a todos en general, y no legitimar su poder sobre nosotras. Al contrario, es decir con hechos: 'yo no te voté. Ni la mayoría tampoco lo hizo. Ni a ti ni a ninguno. Por lo que me veo con todo el derecho del mundo a luchar contra la imposición de tu poder sobre mí. ¿quien te ha dado ese derecho?' Pienso que la abstención activa es una de nuestras mejores armas. Una vez dicho todo esto, soy de los que piensan que no se puede generalizar. Es decir, llevar la abstención por bandera y válido para cualquier situación, no creo que sea lo correcto ya que lo convertiríamos en un dogma de Fe. Cada contexto, cada lugar, cada momento,...requiere un análisis concreto sobre que es lo mas oportuno. También soy de los que opinan que el tema de votar o no votar, es algo personal, que cada cual haga lo que considere conveniente después de analizar cada situación concreta como he dicho anteriormente, y que lo realmente importante es lo que haces el resto del año, y no cuando eres llamada a participar en el sistema.

They may do what they wish to the state-property, Of course! It keeps true, Bakunin: All property is theft! &#x200B; Let us not count the crimes any longer, jurists. Yellow coats, they let faux-police free reign. A wave of yellow coats, amidst them, killers. The killers must wear no coats. The police kill. The faux-police behave like that, From a highly visible mist. &#x200B; Pick one off and put on your coat. Disappear. Waves of tremor through all in The industry of the uniform. &#x200B; YELLOW COATS DO NOT INTERFERE WITH FAUX-POLICE. YELLOW COATS DO NOT SHOOT OR JEOPARDISE OTHERS. &#x200B; Rise, you who wish to rise. Long live post-subjugation, whenever she arrives. Paris, your bravery is seen elsewhere.

If it were possible to measure public opinion would it be a good idea to do so?,Anarchism,"There are people who are honestly trying to fix our democracy, but at the same time they worry about the outcomes. Here is a typical example from a group trying to fix democracy: “My Vote” is a website where anyone can vote, and anyone can submit a question to be voted on. Here’s the problem, ”My vote” Controls the questions to be asked, and as stated on their website, if they become popular in the future they will begin requiring participants to view information packages use prior to voting. Do you see a problem? Am I the only one? It seems that I cannot get anyone to discuss a free system with no controls. Do you think it would be a good idea if we could accurately measure public opinion? Or do you think it’s better to have some kind of controls like the people at “my Vote”? I’m going to ask Noam Chomsky his opinion on this question in an email, what do you think his response will be? Here’s why I’m asking these questions. The big problems of this world can only be solved by worldwide cooperation from the average people of this world.

'The Market System Must Go! — Section 4: The Futility of Reformism' (1997). A part of a pamphlet from the SPGB.,Anarchism,"{**Note:** I am posting this part in particular as opposed to the whole pamphlet as while much of the content in said pamphlet is helpful for anarchists, large parts of it are not due to the fact that it was created by a revolutionary socialist party and not an anarchist organization. } &#x200B; **Section 4: The Futility of Reformism** &#x200B; Many people have sympathy with the socialist idea of a world of common ownership and free access to replace the present system of buying and selling, but say that such a transformation is a long way off and that in the meantime we must still aim for improvements within the framework of the existing system. They point to the changes that have taken place in peoples lives since the nineteenth century. They point to the fact that in countries like Britain children no longer run around without shoes on their feet, no-one starves, medical facilities are available to all, everybody receives an education, and many people own things previously undreamed of - a car, a house perhaps, and a host of electrical gadgets. It is worth trying to get more of these improvements, they say, and the best way to do it is to press governments for reforms. &#x200B; Legislative reforms may have helped to improve the conditions of life for wage and salary earners,but the main factor in this has been the struggle of workers in trade unions to gain pay increases and improved conditions. Before considering whether it is worth working for reforms, the question it is relevant to ask is why do governments bring them in? Is it through concern for people's well being? Is it through pressure from groups of committed people outside Parliament? Is it through a combination of the two? Or is it for some other reason? &#x200B; It may at first sight seem that certain reforms are motivated by humanitarian concern on the part of governments. The 'welfare state' legislation, for example, brought in after World War Two, provided state pensions and medical treatment for almost the whole population. It may seem that public agitation for reforms also does a lot to help, as when abortion was legalised in 1967 after many years of campaigning by members of the Abortion Law Reform Association. &#x200B; Yet if we look closely at the mass of laws governments have passed over the years, we find not only measures which seem to have a humane motive, but others which are just the opposite. Labour's 1965 and 1969 Immigration Acts, for example, caused heartbreak for many would-be Commonwealth immigrants including some with British passports, while in 1980 some of the poorest among Britain's population were made poorer still by a Conservative Social Security Act which cut benefits for unemployed people and invalidity pensioners by five per cent. And if we look closely at the history of reform legislation, we find that sometimes governments seem to take notice of relatively small-scale campaigns (such as with the 1967 law change on homosexuality) while at other times very large reform movements -such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament - produce no alteration in government policy at all. &#x200B; Why then do some of the reforms governments bring in seem to mark social progress while others are clearly backward and oppressive? Why does a government appear on one issue to listen to appeals from reform campaigners and on another to be completely deaf to them? The answer to these questions is that the attitude of governments does not depend on the good-heartedness or otherwise of particular parties or politicians, or on the special ability of any particular pressure group outside parliament to influence them. The answer lies in an understanding of the function of governments. &#x200B; Governments are not there to solve the problems of those who elect them. Nor are they impartial. Governments are there to administer in the most smooth and efficient way possible a system whose whole economic mechanism is governed by the search for profits. Priority has to be given to profits since they are, as it were, its lifeblood. The single-minded pursuit of profit is the system's economic logic, the driving force of capital, and imposes itself on governments whether they like it or not. Governments can try to resist it - as some have done for a short while - but in the end they are forced to accept the logic of the system that puts profits first. The capital and the profits are owned by that small class of people who possess the land, the factories, farms, offices and communications systems - society's means of living. Governments, therefore, exist to serve the interests of this minority class. &#x200B; It follows that all reforms are brought forward within the economic limitations of capitalism and generally have the aim of creating the best conditions possible for profits to be made. They cannot allow the interests of the wage and salary earners to obstruct this. This explains why a government can pass some laws that are unambiguously detrimental to workers' interests and others that are of some benefit. The point is that any benefit is always incidental, never central, to a law's purpose. &#x200B; This also explains the seemingly inconsistent attitude of governments to pressure from reform campaigners. If a campaign is proposing a certain reform that happens to be in line with, or at least not contrary to, a government's own plans for administering the capitalist system, the government will not be averse to lending an ear and indeed not be particularly upset if the campaign takes credit for any legislation passed. Campaigns are, in fact, sometimes whipped up by governments themselves to gain support for unpopular, but from the point of view of a section of the capitalist class, essential measures, as for example the Labour Party's campaign in the 1975 referendum to get people to vote 'yes' to staying in what was then the EEC. If, however, a campaign is out of line with the profit-making needs of the system, then no amount of protest or public pressure has any effect. The recent campaign against nuclear weapons was doomed to failure because it ignored the fact that the British government, like others, has to have at its disposal the most up-to-date weapons available to protect the interests of the British owning class in potential disputes, and deter foreign owning classes interfering with the power structures, markets, trade routes and sources of raw materials which are essential to the continued making of profits. &#x200B; In the same way a well-intentioned organisation like Shelter cannot succeed in its aim of obtaining decent housing for everyone. The housing problem could of course be solved tomorrow if production were allowed to be carried on simply to satisfy human needs. What prevents it is the rigidity of the economic system that insists that profits must be made out of producing things. As there is no profit to be made in producing decent houses for people who cannot afford them, a government cannot pass laws ordering houses to be built for them without making someone pay the bill. &#x200B; This is not to say that governments can never be influenced by protest campaigns. The outcry in the trade union movement in 1969 caused the Labour government to drop its plan to introduce an Industrial Relations Act ('In Place of Strife') and the campaign by Welsh nationalists in 1980 persuaded the Tories to keep their election promise to set up a television channel in Welsh (S4C). Similarly, in the early 1990's the campaign against the Community Charge ('Poll Tax') helped get that tax replaced by another, although in this instance the campaigners were helped by the gross inefficiency of the Poll Tax as well as by popular discontent. &#x200B; Despite the hopes of reform campaigners everywhere, governments will only bend to such pressure on issues of either minor importance or which are causing them social, political or financial problems. They are not, as many people think, free agents who can do whatever they want. They operate within a definite economic and social framework that severely limits their options. &#x200B; Governments - all governments - must constantly bring in reforms. The continuously changing industrial, economic and social situation produced by the systems dynamic, competitive nature dictates this. These reforms, however, must be broadly in line with the overall interests of the owning, profit-making minority. Let us take a few examples from the history of reform legislation to see how this has operated: &#x200B; The 1870 Education Act, supported by both Liberals and Tories in Parliament, began the process whereby basic educational facilities were to be provided by the state for all children regardless of their parent's means. This was not done, however, with the idea that workers' children should as of right have a decent education, but to ensure the turning out of more literate, better trained workers for an industrial society that was becoming increasingly complex. &#x200B; The first modern-style social security legislation was brought in by the Liberals with the introduction of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908 when pensions started to be paid to the state to some over-seventies. Here the government was not acting out of compassion for old people suffering poverty, but was following up a Cabinet paper of December 1906 which pointed out that pensions for the old would mean large savings in Poor Law costs. &#x200B; The introduction of the 'welfare state' in Britain under a Labour government after the Second World War brought in a comprehensive system of 'free' health care, unemployment benefits, state pensions and family allowances. However, contrary to popular belief, this legislation was not wanted for humanitarian reasons. It resulted from the realisation by politicians and industrialists that an all-embracing scheme of social security would be cheaper to run than the existing piecemeal system and, above all, that healthier, more contented workers would make a more efficient, and therefore cheaper, labour force. Sir William Beveridge, who drew up the original plan, constantly argued in his Report that his proposals would be more economical to administer than previous methods, and in February 1943 Samuel Courtauld, millionaire Tory industrialist, said of the Report: 'Social security of this nature will be about the most profitable long-term investment the country could make. It will not undermine the morale of the nations' workers: it will ultimately lead to higher efficiency among them and a lowering of production costs' (Manchester Guardian, 19 February 1943). Most other employers were apparently of the same opinion, for in a poll conducted at the time, 75 per cent of them agreed that the Beveridge Report should be adopted (Susanne MacGregor, The Politics of Poverty, p.21.). &#x200B; In 1956 the Clean Air Act, brought in by the Tories, introduced smokeless zones and got rid of London's smog. But the Acts driving force was not the desire that people should have a clean environment to live and work in, but the findings of the government Beaver Committee that the cost of pollution to Britain (and therefore a loss in profits) was in the order of £250 million annually, then a huge sum. &#x200B; The 1969 Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, a Labour Private Member's Bill which gained all-party support, had provision for services and facilities to improve living conditions for disabled people. But, even in this case, the expense had to be justified on economic grounds: its sponsor, Alf Morris MP, stressed the saving that would result from providing disabled people with facilities to live at home rather than institutionalising them. &#x200B; It should be clear to everyone that all the political parties that have held office are reforming parties. No one party, 'left' or 'right', holds a monopoly on reforms. Although the Labour Party has always posed as the champion of reforms and is thought of as such by many people, reforms which have been of some apparent benefit to workers have no less often been brought in by Liberal and Conservative governments. Even the set of reforms the Labour Party is fond of parading as its showpiece, the 'welfare state', was accepted in principle by the wartime coalition of Liberal, Labour and Tory parties. Its first stage, the 1945 Family Allowances Act, was a measure agreed by the Coalition government and actually became law during the short Conservative ministry of May-July 1945. &#x200B; Furthermore, when the needs of the system have dictated it, Labour has shown itself to be just as ruthless as the other parties in introducing reforms that have been openly harmful to the working class. Its National Health Service Amendment Act of 1949 provided for a charge for prescriptions from family doctors, and in 1951 it introduced charges for dentures and spectacles. This was after Aneurin Bevan, Labour Health Minister, had already stated in a press conference that the government had 'set its face against' the whole idea of NHS charges. Labour's 1964-70 measures included a wage freeze, increases in prescription charges, the abolition of free milk in secondary schools and the 'four-week rule' under which any single unskilled worker under the age of 45 would be granted supplementary benefit for only four weeks if work was considered to be available in the area. In 1977 a Labour government again cut back on the National Health Service and also made drastic cuts in resources allocated to education. &#x200B; The claims of the Labour Party to be the reforming party par excellence are simply not backed up by experience. Nor, given the nature of the system it commits itself to administer, can this be any different in the future. Whatever the levels of state benefits may be, the overall income of workers in real terms tends to adjust to the amount necessary to maintain themselves as workers and to bring up their children in a similar condition. And if any further evidence of this is needed, we need only look at the total failure of Labour's counterparts abroad - in France under Mitterrand, Australia under Hawke and Keating, and in Clinton's America, to name but a few. All these administrations with great reforming intentions were able to do was run the system according to its own economic logic - profits first, wage and salary workers a poor second. &#x200B; There cannot be such a thing as a humane reforming party. Moreover, even when reforms of incidental benefit to workers are brought in, in practice they often turn out to be less beneficial than people expect. Labour's post-war nationalisation reforms are in a case in point. Many people had great hopes for nationalisation. These hopes were reflected by Will Paynter of the National Union of Mineworkers in his book British Trade Unions and the Problems of Change, where nationalisation was referred to as 'the dawn of a new era' in which 'workers were moving forward to the control of their own destinies'. But it quickly became clear to people that neither 'public ownership' of the nationalised industries nor working in them made any fundamental difference at all to their conditions of life or work. Paynter, who had been secretary of the NUM, realised this and went on to say 'The relationship between management and workers remained the same; the union still had to fight hard to get improvements in wages and conditions and little in the daily lives of the men reflected the change that had taken place'. &#x200B; Another example is Labour's 1965 Rent Act. It was widely thought that the setting up of tribunals to allow appeals against rent charges would lead to a lower level of rents. Its effect was the opposite. Many landlords applied for increases while few tenants applied for reductions. The reason for this was that to apply for a reduction was likely to be the equivalent of signing one's own eviction notice. &#x200B; There are many examples from capitalist history of reforms that promised much but delivered little. Indeed, the very nature of capitalism and the conflicting interests within it make the outcome of reform legislation uncertain and unpredictable, however well-intentioned it may be. Governments constantly need to revise and modify reforms to fit in with new circumstances that they did not or could not foresee. In the long run only those measures that 'pay their way' in the sense of maintaining or increasing the productive efficiency of the workforce, are useful to the system. If, either through miscalculation or changed circumstances, a reform turns out to be over-generous then the situation is sooner or later corrected by the reform being drastically cut back or whittled away. In recent years we have seen many examples of this in countries the world over - in health, education, social security, transport and other fields too. The expenditures of the state have become too burdensome for the profitable sectors of industry to carry, so changes have had to be made. Funds have been cut, privatisation introduced and commercialisation pursued in essential services. &#x200B; The question the reformers of all parties must consider is, after decades of activity, was all their reform campaigning really worth it? And today, is there any point in spending so much time running fast to simply stand still? Socialists unequivocally answer no - it need not be like this. A democratic socialist revolution can sweep away the need for constant reform activity, its stresses and its failures. Socialists know that the work of patching up capitalism will never be done, so why waste time and energy embarking on an impossible mission?",a5eam3,self.Anarchism,,True

Are those who consciously choose to submit to hierarchy equally as dangerous as the exploiters themselves?,Anarchism,"Are they responsible for taking away the freedoms of those who don’t want to partake in it by willing submission to the exploiter in the first place (Within situations when they can infact choose to resist) in thinking along the lines of “I know my place master/my superior, and others must learn their place too. You are the stronger one and entitled to more food than me.” If it’s faked obedience for survival where they can then plan to backstab it when the chance comes then this is understandable, but if it’s the above case they are enemies of and traitors to the people alongside our freedom? In this sense these people if they exist are known as Enemies of Liberty/Freedom as talked about by people such as Robespierre in the French Revolution. They enable the hierarchy through willing submission, discourage/shun/shame rebellion and encourage submission, conformity. I’ve seen quasi-fascist neoliberals who’ve adopted the ideology and Nazis like to throw around the term ‘alpha/beta’ while citing ‘pack mentality’. In reality this is a reinvention of an old pre-enlightenment reactionary concept that men have ‘natural superiors’ who are somehow entitled to obedience and compliance from the ‘lessers’ because ‘nature says so’. Mostly in mind when talking about those with a ‘bully’ personality nobody likes. They forget this cannot exist without any of our consent in the first place. The archetypal ideal behind the enlightenment was disobedience and rebellion against these so-called ‘natural superiors’, as well as rebellion against injustice in all its forms.",a4i9il,self.Anarchism,,True
Some words of holiday cheer and encouragement,Anarchism,"It is time to wake up again into the Dream. To shout “fire!” in the theater, not as a hoax, but as a promise. To give battle in both worlds at once, and to simply negate our obvious defeat, because the Machine can never dictate the terms of our surrender if the reasons we rebel remain illegible to it. Destroying us has always been the last resort of repression, because we are the Machine’s most valuable resource. It has thrived by welding its survival to our own. But if we define survival not in material terms but in the continuing of rebellion, in the passing on of a Dream, an Idea, then we become the wolf in its flock, the sugar in its gas tank, and the gremlin in its gears. Somewhere, we need to find the courage to be hopeless. To face our defeat, and go on fighting, but this time with the whole of ourselves, with blind rage and with long sight. Unlike land, unlike loved ones, relations, forests, health, customs, collectivities, imagination cannot be taken by force; it can only be surrendered, but at any moment, we can recover it. It is the tiny weapon smuggled into the prison, the bare minimum for plotting a grandiose escape. Outnumbered, defeated, disarmed, corralled; we have come to the moment of craziness, beyond hard and easy choices. It is time to launch a counterattack in both worlds at once. For the anarchist majority of human history, people have usually made the easier choice, avoiding the state, running for the hills. Now there’s nowhere left to run. When you’re cornered, attack.

Now sure we have smuggling going on to get aid in but the logistics required to pull of these I still think requires a lot of effort. &#x200B; We already know this issue isn't going to be resolved anytime soon and many many people are going to starve before that happens. So how to we take things into our own hands and subvert the blockade. Increase the rate of supplies to the nation with a mechanism that insures safe and efficient delivery of supplies. &#x200B; Personally I was thinking of devising an open source balloon delivery system. That caries supplies from one location, uses gps to guide itself to a set location to drop its load. It probably needs to have some sort of propulsion system that's slow but reliable enough to slowly guide it towards the destination. &#x200B; If we get a collective going, to develop this further, I think anything is possible? So, what do you guys think? If we want things to change we need to be that change. Otherwise things will get worse and worse. &#x200B; A reference of what is possible. ",a8t569,self.Anarchism,,True

What I want to know is, do any of you guys have good statistics on if ICE actually dents crime? I feel like people lick the boots of these Stasi because they are 'keeping people safe'. How true is that? &#x200B; To be honest, it's a lose-lose for bootlickers in this situation because it's either: 1. They're effective, but only because they commit moral wrongdoing and thus should be abolished. 2. They're ineffective yet promote needless suffering for immigrants and thus should be abolished.

Id imagine that there would be potentially billions across the globe that never settle down and enter a commune, opting instead to wander around the globe, vksiting different communes for a few weeks at a time before moving on.

Radical community's self-care and self-improvement,Anarchism,"Too many ideas, far too little times... First of all, I want to make it clear that these ideas aren't my own, and mostly thought up based on the personal reflection and experience of radical communities through times of organizing, online and IRL. If I'm preaching the choir, please let me know and I'll remove this post. However, I would like to stress that these things should be reminded and repeated, to accommondate any marginalized member of our community. Especially in these times, where the world is racing toward collapse, those who's already in risk of oppression in the old world, will be further much brutalized in the coming dark ages. And thus, at all costs, we must build a rigid but dynamic network of mutual aid to peer support the health in general, mental health and practical skills of surviving for radicals. It's deeply inspiring to see radical movements coming back to life. r/EarthStrike and r/ExtinctionRebellion in dual action (I apologize for being a previous disbeliever, but now I do see the importance of these movements), direct action networks of Abolish ICE, Black Lives Matter and NoDAPL making a comeback. In addition to the steady grown of solidarity support for both labor (IWW/Catholic Workers), politic (DSA) and militant (r/SocialistRA and r/RedneckRevolt), it is heart warming to learn that the Left is still kicking around. However, most of these movements seriously lack of extended community support for self-care and self-improvement, of supportive development for members of the movement. Without grooming of mental health and basic health, we soon become exhausted from the struggle. It is foremost important why mutual aid support must be the foundation of any organizing. Thus why I made this post, hopefully can rally support from anti-capitalist communities across Reddit. I know this was written in r/anarchism, however, this is a call of support for all members, as in the most non-sectarian way. And yes, this is even meant to be inclusive extending to post-left anarchists, as folks like it or not, posties are also anti-capitalist radicals in their own way. So I hope we can put down our differences and instead turn toward to support each other. Like human beings. (And no, please don't derail it, this is not another left-unity thing) Vast majority of radical groups of various sizes, often lack the mutual aid structure to reach out toward marginalized members, especially those who are in most crisis. We often talk about the growth of an affinity group, a union or an organization, etc... But what's good does the growth even do, if there is no support for the existing members suffer from depression, stress and psychological trauma from this crooked society? I mean, sure we talk about mutual aid all the times, even recommending newbies to read Bread Santa's Mutual Aid, but what good does any of those even do, if there is no praxis of them in action? Caring for the health, mental and physical, of the members, is to mutually assure that everyone can co-exist in the most mannerism way. Health care support does not take rocket science to have it work. A simple act of compassion toward those in need, is already the selflessness of mental support. To an extend of self-care, including mental and physical, take much less efforts than professional teaching and budget to support your community. The closest example of mutual care support that happened on a leftist community, was in r/SocialistRA,  Many members who are current EMT/EMS came to answer the most direct and helpful to OP. This proves that mutual aid health support of any group does not require some shrink to determine whether your peer support group was effective or not. Praxis does not require senseless meritocrats to gatekeep it from happening. In my workplace committee, we set up basic and direct approaches for health support. Members receive free CPR and AED training from members who already certified in this field. We also give training of overdose prevention and how to handle Naxolone kit. We host first aid sessions monthly at a rented office space, handing out palmplets and guides made by ourselves. Many of our workers are parents, so we invited child care trainer to give sessions on care, with little in return such as fund for our next training. Mental care is most important, we have active peer support mini groups within the workplace, giving advice and stress relief for workers. Since some workers are elderly or have terminal illness that prevent them from working long hours, we have an accommodation system in place, that workers voluntarly take certain uncomfortable shifts for those in need, in return they get rewards from our committee, such as gifts or extra stuff during our gatherings/meetings. We have WhatsApp and Signal groups for peer support, there are no set groups, and workers can just create new group and other will hop in to help them out. These support strategies is based on mutual aid inspiration from online resources. Anyway, looking forward for leftists on reddit to start care support group for their subreddit, and particularly in this community. From self-care, to extend of self-improvement. Self-improvement is about helping yourselves the necessity of survival in this collapsing society, regardless of ages, genders or background. r/stealthissub was intended to be what I described, except it's just so dead. In seeking to fill the void, I hope this community can either found a new sub, or improve the existing subs, for this aspect. Just to be clear, self-improvement does not limit to technical skills such as computer repairing, monkeywrenching and gardening, or surviving such as shoplifting and camping, but also extending to hobbies such as playing an instrument, or meditation. It is important to include self-improvement skills like meditation where it is inclusive to anyone, because many members of our community are people with disability, whether physical, neurodivergent, etc, and I have been taught by recent members that certain skills are ableism toward people with disability, forgive me for my previous ignorance. So yeah, TL;DR, we should have self-care and self-improvement working groups in our community, as it seriously lacks in the current prospect of leftist organizing. Questions? Ideas?

Book suggestions for a present?,Anarchism,"Hey all. Looking for advice on buying a book for a close friend that likes to read. He's a big fan of sci-fi, especially the classics; Asimov, LeGuin, Dicks etc. He is left-wing (in the ballpark of democratic socialism) but older and doesn't really 'get' a lot of current leftist discourse. He's also very much into science (esp astrophysics) and skepticism. He's strongly atheistic and outright antitheistic, sometimes to the point where it gets kinda annoying. I want to give him something that he really enjoys and that also gives him some better understanding of contemporary left-wing (esp libsoc) theory. I don't want the present to be like a 'here, have some propaganda'; I want it to be something that he actually enjoys. But I'd also like him to learn some more modern analysis, since he likes to think about and discuss these things but his arguments often feel off. A straight white dude with the heart in the right place, but who hasn't been organized since the 70's and not really caught up with developments since then, you know. So, I'm looking for a book that's interesting for someone like him and still has good analytical content. Maybe a good social sci-fi novel a'la LeGuin. Maybe an interesting non-fiction book about technology's effect on social relationships from a socialist perspective. Any tips? Thanks.",a967j8,self.Anarchism,,True

An Egoist case for Socialism,Anarchism,"I've been thinking recently about if you can make an Egoist case for Socialism, and I'm curious what you people think on here. &#x200B; I believe in psychological egoism, because I think that people only experience what their brain does, that it's impossible to act selflessly unless it's for an emotional reward in our own brain because otherwise we're selfless randomly for no reason. I'm also a Hedonist in that I believe people are only driven by the creation of positive experiences; the reason we're not all selfish maniacs is that we are social animals and we gain an emotional reward for helping others and an emotional punishment for hurting them. Of course this isn't the case for all people, otherwise masters wouldn't exist. &#x200B; I think that the opium of the masses validates the current and past power structures by appealing to people's self interest. The idea being that if you submit to the masters of your society you will get a reward in the afterlife; or that this life doesn't matter at all and you would be evil for wanting to improve your standing in it. Nietzsche thought that slave morality was invented by slaves, but no matter who invented it it really helps the masters quell dissent. If people acknowledge that this is the only life we have, then they will work to achieve paradise in it, team up with their fellow man and abolish Capitalism; because who would live willingly under economic domination? &#x200B; Of course it wouldn't be in the master's (Feudal or Capitalist) interest to allow their power to wither away unless they weren't ok with the risk of dominating the working class. With the modern military equipment the bourgeoisie employ, I really doubt the working class could overthrow them, but since a large part of the production process still employs people the bourgeoisie can't afford to kill too many. I'm thinking a mass strike in the third world and a smaller strike in the first world in solidarity. &#x200B; If we were all Egoists then why would we risk losing our own lives you ask? Either to make life better for those we care about, to make life better for the emotional reward of selflessness, or to roll the dice that our own lives might be better if we survive. Underneath my philosophy it would make sense for both the masters and slaves to vie for power, but who do I think would win? The slaves of course, because they do everything, and without them society ceases to function. &#x200B; I'm not convinced this would lead to a Socialist society with a planned economy, as the good of all might not be the driving force behind the revolution, but I think if most people became came to the realization that they are egoists and that a reward after death is a lie masters would cease to exist.",a2yia7,self.Anarchism,,True

Question about Anarchism,Anarchism,"Hello Anarchists, I have some questions regarding how anarchism would work. I’m a far leftist who began reading on the ideology throughout the last week and I’ve watched a couple of videos on how it would work (including the ones from non-compete) and I have a few questions. The method discussed by non-compete is a form of Anarchism where there are wards which make up communes. The wards with 150 people and the commune having around 10,000 people (thereby one commune is made up of 60-70 ward). His proposed method of resource management is through contract trade. One commune trades with other communes to receive resources that it requires or desires. The example non-compete used in his video was buses as the import and vacuum cleaners and dishwashers as exports. This leads me to my questions. How would the factories or resources be divided among communes if all state was dissolved and anarchy was imposed democratically today? What can be done for geographical disparities among communes, such as one commune being located in a resource rich location geographically (say the Middle East) and another one being located in a poor location (say Iceland or Greenland)? What methods are there to prevent one trade savvy commune from obtaining a far better trade deal on every occasion and thereby creating a monopoly of resources? How would modern transportation work (airplane, train and boats)? How would migration between communes be handled to ensure that we don’t create extremely high population density, too small communes or imbalance in between the amount of labor each ward or commune produces? I am very intrigued by this political theory and just need some help understanding how it can be used in practice.",aa096w,self.Anarchism,,True

Government shutdown another example of Trump's authoritarianism? Absolutely...,Anarchism,"He is attempting to force votes from senators with threats to shut down the federal government, stripping federal workers (who have children to feed) of their wages while still forcing them to work. The shutdown would also impact the lives of hundreds of thousands of citizens, especially the impoverished. Trump is using this threat to get what he wants, no matter what. And what he wants is a wall. This wall costs 5.7 billion dollars and can be beaten by 100 dollars at a hardware store with a ladder and a rope. The wall won't fix immigration, it isn't supposed to, and the president is aware of that. The wall is a prop, a way to grab attention from his voters, a way to generate publicity among the alt-right, and you know who pays for it? You do. The taxpayers do. Aren't Republicans to be about fiscal responsibility? Not anymore, conservative Republicans are dead, and their supporters became independents. Republicans are now the nationalists, the facsists, the people the American revolution sought to escape from now lead, no, control us. Join a rally, if there isn't one near you, organize one.

How to end a revolt 101,Anarchism,"So your workers are revolting. A few questions are running through your head. How did it come to this? What should I do? In situations like these, the most important thing is to display a sense of calm. Do not act guilty, or sorry, or concerned. Smile and wave and then get the hell off camera! Now all revolts are different, of course. The reasons will be different, the use of force will vary, the demands will fluctuate. Rest assured, whatever sparked the outrage is irrelevant to stopping it. There are three things you must do to beat complicity back into your workers. * Number One: Anticipate Demands This one should be simple enough to understand. You need to anticipate not only the demands that will be made, but the first day of strikes *before they happen*. This is critical. You need to draft legislation, have some sort of proposal already sitting on your desk with plenty of pretty words and subparagraphs. Whether or not you enact these reforms is irrelevant; the point is having something you can use as proof that you were already planning to make the changes being called for. You need this proof to reach the police, your administration, the media and foreign nations. Decry the protesters as impatient and irrational. Blame them for the damage to public goods, the 'disruption', etc, and get the rest of the world on *your* side. * Number Two: Diversify Your Attacks In the days of old, you could simply shoot the organizers in the street and have the presses print your version of events. With cameras and microphones in every pocket, this is no longer an option. Your best defense is being able to claim you are *civilized* and the protesters are not. To keep up this illusion, you cannot use lethal force, at least not immediately. Indeed, the longer you wait, the more you can blame your workers for being unreasonable, destructive, etc. In the meantime, rely on rubber bullets, water canons, chemical irritants, barricades and shields. Try not to use batons too quickly. These are much more personal in attack style, and may serve to radicalize even the less committed protester. Remember, you want to break their spirit, not their 'better nature'. * Number Three: Appeal to their 'Better Nature' It may surprise you, but even the most radical participant can be turned. But don't wait for that to become necessary! For example, say you let food prices soar while cutting the social safety net. Your riot will be violent from the beginning. It won't be nearly as easy to control compared to a permitted march or quiet 'sit in'. In a situation such as this, you want to appeal to the mass of protesters who have not yet crossed the point of no return. Make generic appeals to the public good, the children, the future, whatever catches their ears. Convince them to inform on or entirely betray the more radical factions and work the protesters down to a comfortable boil. As they rely on less radical but more physically demanding methods, they will burn out faster and with far less time to recuperate. If the protest is radicalized by the police killing a civilian(s), seize the opportunity to direct focus to the future. Rephrase it but keep the conversation on *the future*. Eventually the media cycle will stop reporting the civilian executions and start talking about 'where we go from here'. This is perfect; it is exactly what you want. You need protesters to start demanding *reforms* and *police training*. Convince them, and everyone else, that this was simply poor oversight or a few bad apples. Destroy any rhetoric about systemic violence or organized corruption. If need be, break your own government into factions and have them blame each other for the riots. In time, this will serve useful as the protestors return to partisanship and can no longer organize effectively. * Conclusion: Sabotage Beats Silence You are developed and relatively more peaceful because your method of crowd control is *superior* to authoritarian states. You have a moral high ground you can parade around, a line you pretend you can't cross. This is why your government is sustainable in the long term. You are the protestors *friend*. While sabotaging them from behind the scenes, publicly you swear to never *silence* them. If that weren't enough, you even allow the media to report on them. You hold negotiations with the (least radical) leaders of the protests. How can anyone accuse you of being unreasonable? Follow this advice and you can crush even the most determined revolution.",a42y6h,self.Anarchism,,True

What's a good stance on how is 'minimal control' of people attained in anarchist contexts? E.g. no 'arbitrary' violence?,Anarchism,"What's a good stance on how is 'minimal control' of people attained in anarchist contexts? E.g. no 'arbitrary' violence? &#x200B; This is possibly an old topic, but as philosophical question I find it quite hard to conclude on. The reason is the dichotomy between control and non-control (anarchism), but this might also be because of state-biased 'presuppositions'. That the state is associated with 'protection'. &#x200B; But given no state, how is 'orderly order' supposed to be managed? How can one solve or progress from the dichotomy of 'there cannot be control' and 'there must be some control'? &#x200B; Intuitively, with responsible individuals, anarchism could always be problem-free. However, there will certainly always be cases, when someone considers some action to be breach of something. And then there's an urge to control it somehow. An individual vs individual control may exist in theory, but in practice what would be stopping e.g. physically stronger people? I'm not sure if it's possible to 'want no rules, while expecting rules'. And I don't trust in the idea of 'good-willing people' *in general,* since there's plenty of examples that societies, communities contain 'outlier cultures', which have some habits that may be considered somehow harmful. Unless 'considered harmful' is to be a subjective thing, i.e. that there would not exist much of 'what's orderly in general'. Although this may contradict the pursuits of human communities, if 'detrimental to community' and 'beneficial to community' would make no difference. &#x200B; Sometimes the 'development' of the police for example seems more like 'natural progression' in political philosophy, rather than 'arbitrary' (what anarchism may claim). That is, development of concepts such as the police is 'development' from the problem domain of 'how to solve the problem of control, while not being dependent on individual conscience of it'. With people acting as their own police, well, what's there to stop the physically stronger for example?",a3udz8,self.Anarchism,,True

The New Declaration of Independence,Anarchism,"If people are serious, then let's finally do something about the world at large. The easiest and best way to get things to change is to disengage from the whole mess and start anew. I am proposing a full out abandonment of society. By leaving the workforce and every market entirely, we're going to cripple nations by making their wallets useless to us. They can't bomb and pollute if nobody supports them financially, so what I propose is that every available body prepares to go camp out for an indeterminate amount of time at every national park and UNESCO heritage site that they possibly can. We buy camping permits, and we prepare to fully disengage from buying anything and from working. No bills, no rent, no gas, no Amazon bullshit. If 10% off the global workforce decided to do this, we would trigger a global recession that would bring every country to its knees without having shed a single drop of blood, or tangle with police. We're going to behave, and fully enjoy our vacation from capitalism until it either gets a soul and agrees to our demands, or nations fall into complete chaos in every major metropolitan center on Earth seemingly overnight, after which we will begin construction on a new way of life via the document below. This document is not a constitution, but a set of ideals that we believe in. The following link is there for easy sharing and sending to various heads of state. I know that it's a change.org petition, it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. (Print it and stick it on light poles if it makes you feel better. )  The New Declaration of Independence We, the people of these United States, can no longer abide by the rule of law that has become corrupt and tyrannical. Therefore, we reject the ideals and institutions that have become oppressive against not only our own citizens, but to our values as well. As such, we have decided upon a series of articles that accurately reflects our values and will be the basis for our new laws. Article 1: Every human has the right to govern their own body however they choose, mentally or physically. It is the most important property that anyone has, and it is unethical for any institution or governing body to take that away from them. The only exception to be made for this is imprisonment, and only then on the conviction of a violent crime, war crime or a civil rights violation, as they have proven that they do not regard the first right of others. Article 2: Every human has the right of innocence until proven guilty. They shall not have their freedom of movement infringed upon without being convicted of a violent crime. Article 3: Every human has the right to privacy. They shall not be forced, or otherwise coerced to reveal any information that they do not want to reveal. The only exception to this is directly related to the preservation of evidence to be used in a court of law. Article 4: Every human has the right to the basic necessities for an equal start in life. No person shall ever be denied a basic income, defined as the amount of capital needed to ensure that a person will never go unsheltered or unfed. Article 5: Every human has the right to equal and humane rule of law. No person shall ever be subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment, even as punishment. Article 6: Every human has the right to expression. They shall not be barred from using their voice in any manner that they choose, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. Article 7: Every human has the right to education. No human shall ever be denied the ability to learn about the laws that govern them, or be denied the education that they may require to improve their lives. Article 8: Every human has the right to believe in moral authority, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others to do the same. No person shall ever be denied religious freedom or cultural expression, as long as it does not harm others. Article 9: Every human has the right to belong to a community. No person shall ever be removed in any manner from an ethnic, ideological or religious group without their consent, unless they have violated the first article of this Declaration. Article 10: Every human has the right to cast a single vote on any law, or lawmaker, that impacts their life in any way. No person or institution may ever revoke this right. Article 11: Every human has the right to resist. If any law or order is deemed unethical, then any person may refuse to obey it and not suffer consequences for doing so, as long as a jury of their peers has deemed the law that they are accused of resisting is unethical. Article 12: Every human has the right to enough clean water to sustain their own life. Article 13: Every human has the right to travel freely, unless they have violated the first article of this Declaration. Article 14: Every human has the right to healthcare goods or services that are necessary to continue living. Article 15: Every human has the right to live in a clean, and safe environment. No person or institution shall ever knowingly or willingly destroy or otherwise dismantle any environmental protections or safeguards necessary to keep our planet inhabitable. Article 16: Every human has the right to an unbiased government. No lawmaker, representative, or government institution may be forced, bribed or otherwise coerced to favor any law or decree that causes any bias for or against any human, or any unethical treatment of any human. Our legislation is to be purely impartial and democratic. We, the undersigned, believe in these articles so fervently that we will support them until our dying breath. As the Sons and Daughters of Liberty and Justice, we do hereby lend our signature to this Declaration in order to tell all generations, from this day until humanity's last day, that we will no longer stand by while violations of these most basic and true human rights occur.

'The Market System Must Go! — Section 5: The Mythology of the Left' (1997). A part of a pamphlet from the SPGB.,Anarchism,"{**Note:** I am posting this part in particular as opposed to the whole pamphlet as while much of the content in said pamphlet is helpful for anarchists, large parts of it are not due to the fact that it was created by a revolutionary socialist party and not an anarchist organization. } &#x200B; **Section 5: The Mythology of the Left** &#x200B; Many political groups, somewhat disenchanted with orthodox reformist practice, fancy themselves as 'vanguards' of the working class. We do not. We say that workers should reject these would-be elites and organise for socialism democratically, without leaders. &#x200B; By fostering wrong ideas about what socialism is and how it can be achieved the vanguard organisations are delaying the socialist revolution. It may help to clear away confusion if we list a number of doctrines held by most of these groups, and then state why we disagree with them: 1. State ownership is socialism, or a step on the way to socialism. 2. Russia set out on the way to socialism. 3. Socialism will arrive by violent insurrection. 4. Workers cannot attain socialist consciousness by their own efforts, only a trade union consciousness. 5. Workers must vote for the Labour Party. 6. Workers must be led by an elite - a 'vanguard'. 7. Workers must be offered bait to follow this vanguard in the form of ‘transitional demands', a selective programme of reforms. It is easy to see how these beliefs interlock and support each other. If, for example, workers are so feeble-minded that they cannot understand socialist arguments then they need to be led. Socialism will therefore come about without mass understanding, by a disciplined minority seizing power. Widespread socialist education is not only unnecessary, it is pointless. If the best workers can do is reach a trade union consciousness and vote Labour, then this is what they must be urged to do. Since workers must have some incentive to follow the vanguard, 'transitional demands' in the form of reformist promises are necessary, and since these tactics were successful in carrying to power the Russian Bolsheviks, it is assumed that Russia must have set out on the road to socialism. The basic dogma on which all this is founded is that the mass of the workers cannot understand socialism. &#x200B; Vanguardists may protest at this summary, they may insist that they are very much concerned with working class consciousness, and do not assert that workers cannot understand socialist politics. However, an examination of their propaganda reveals that 'consciousness' means merely following the right leaders. When it is suggested that the majority of the working class must attain a clear desire for the abolition of the wages system, and the introduction of a world-wide moneyless community, the vanguardists reply that this is 'too abstract', or (if they are students) 'too academic'. Indeed, they themselves do not strive for such a socialist system. None of the vanguard groups advocate the immediate establishment of a world without wages, with production democratically geared to meeting people's needs. Some of them say, when pushed, that they look forward to such a world 'ultimately', but since this 'ultimate' aim has no effect on their actions it can only be interpreted as an empty platitude. Far from specifying socialism as their aim, they are reticent and muddled about even the capitalist reforms they will introduce if they get power. &#x200B; Ironically, Bernstein's dictum 'The movement is everything, the goal nothing' sums up the vanguard outlook very well, as a cursory glance at Militant or Socialist Worker will confirm. It seems fair to conclude, however, that the vanguardists' ideal is the brutal state capitalist regime that existed in Russia under Lenin, a fact which causes us socialists some concern, as it means we would be liquidated (a fate which would undoubtedly have befallen us under the Bolshevik tyranny). &#x200B; State ownership is not, of course, socialism, but a major feature of all forms of capitalism. It means merely that the capitalist state takes over responsibility for running an industry and exploiting its workers for profit. However wage-slavery is administered it cannot be made to run in the interests of the wage-slaves. &#x200B; The Labour Party, which receives the support of most of the vanguardists, is not socialist and never was meant to be. Every time it has been in power it has administered capitalism in the only way it can be, as a profit-making system organised in the interest of the profit-takers (the capitalists) and not the profit-makers (the workers). The vanguardists are fully aware of this but their proposition that workers cannot understand socialism commits them to the view that the only way workers will come to see that Labour is no good is through personally experiencing the failure of a Labour government to further working class interests. So, they tell workers to vote Labour. Some even join the Labour Party themselves. &#x200B; This is an intellectually arrogant view, which sees workers as dumb creatures that only learn by immediate experience without being able to draw on the past experience transmitted to them by other workers. The thinking behind it is that when the workers see the Labour leaders fail them they will then turn to the vanguard for leadership instead. This has never actually happened - not after 1945, nor after 1964, nor after 1974 - and, fortunately (since experience of rule by a vanguard party is one experience workers can certainly do without), probably never will. Some workers do indeed learn by such experiences, but the vanguardists never do. They go on repeating their slogan 'Vote Labour' in election after election. Their mistaken view of the intellectual capabilities of workers leads them to urge workers to vote against their interests by supporting one particular party of capitalism in preference to its rivals. The Labour leaders are happy with this and so, no doubt, are other supporters of capitalism who realise that the vanguardists merely channel working class discontent away from a really revolutionary course. &#x200B; It is the same with 'transitional demands', which are just promises to reform capitalism. Workers are urged to struggle for these under the leadership of the vanguard party in the expectation that when these reforms fail to materialise or fail to work (as the vanguard know will happen) the workers will turn against the present system. There again, because of their flawed basic position that workers are incapable of understanding socialism, the vanguardists reject the direct approach of presenting workers with the mass of evidence that reforms don't solve problems and at best can only patch them up temporarily, and again seek to manipulate workers into personally going through the experience of failure. &#x200B; Workers don't need to go down any more blind alleys. The vanguardists, however, don't agree. They say workers should go down every blind alley they come across until they learn in the only way they supposedly can - direct personal experience of the futility of reformism. And they appoint themselves to lead workers down these blind alleys. &#x200B; The vanguardists often justify their reformist actions by saying it is a practice known as 'developing consciousness through struggle'. 'Struggle' is apparently a sort of metaphysical driving force which is supposed to turn reforms into sparks of revolution. Such mystification is essential to the curious doctrine that the workers will establish socialism inadvertently, while they are occupied with something else. But the effect of this is to encourage reformist illusions among the workers, and in fact, since all the main capitalist political parties including Labour now recognise the limits that capitalism imposes on improving living standards, the vanguardists have ended up as the main advocates of reformism today. Look again at the misnamed Socialist Worker or any other Leninist paper and you will see that they spend all their time proposing this measure or opposing that measure within capitalism and none educating workers in the basic principles of socialism. Since they don't believe the workers can understand these principles anyway they are at least being consistent; as from their point of view to campaign for socialism is to cast pearls before swine. But once again the effect of their mistaken 'tactic' is to keep capitalism going. &#x200B; The belief that socialism or something like it used to exist in Russia is common to most vanguard groups. This is to be expected: the vanguard strategy has been put into practice many times, and should surely have succeeded once or twice. Russia, from Lenin to Gorbachev, furnished fresh proof every day of class privilege and working class poverty that was typically capitalist, but all its obviously anti-working class features were dismissed as the results of 'degeneration'. Some looked to China or Cuba as less degenerate systems. Some still do. Some even look to North Korea. &#x200B; Others are not so stupid. They are the vanguardists who have come round to the view that Russia was capitalist, but even they still cling to the idea that the Bolshevik revolution was socialist - and, by implication, that a future socialist revolution will be run on similar lines. After all, an admission that the Russian working class never held political power, and that Bolshevism was always a movement for capitalism, would call into question the entire mythology of the left. A topic of serious concern for vanguardists, if no-one else. is the question: when did 'degeneration' start? In truth, more clues to the answer with be found with Robespierre, Tkachev and Lenin than with Stalin. &#x200B; The belief that Russia was socialist or a 'workers' state' has been a source of confusion for many decades now. Happily, it is ebbing away - illusions are usually corrected by material reality sooner or later. But the fact that such a doctrine could catch on so readily shows the hazy conception of socialism that has always been popular amongst vanguardists. Disputes about how to get socialism usually turn out to be disputes about what it is. For instance, it is apparent that if socialism is to be a democratic society a majority of the population must opt for it before it can come into existence. Any minority which intends to impose what it calls 'socialism' on the rest of the population against their wishes or, for that matter, without their express consent, obviously intends to rule undemocratically. A minority which uses violence to get power must use violence to retain power. The means cannot be divorced from the ends. &#x200B; Vanguardism often emerges in the minds of people who know that there is a lot wrong with society and aim at something radically different. But they avoid facing up to the unfortunate fact that at the moment the great majority of workers do not want a fundamental change. Workers grumble and desire palliatives (or these days desire that things don’t get any worse) but they don't seek the end of institutions like the police, the armed forces, nor even the Queen, let alone class ownership, the wages system, money and frontiers - the abolition of which is necessary for socialism. It is this refusal to face squarely that the bulk of the working class still accepts capitalism which leads to notions of elitism and insurrectionary violence, to the idea that workers must be manipulated by slogan-shouting demagogues brandishing reformist bait. Discussion, the most potent means of changing attitudes, is treated with contempt. 'Action' for its own sake is lauded to the skies. &#x200B; We socialists have never tried to forget the obvious fact that the working class does not yet want socialism, but we are encouraged by the knowledge that we, as members of the working class, have reacted to capitalism by opposing it. There is nothing remarkable about us as individuals, so it cannot be a hopeless task to set about changing the ideas of our fellow workers - especially as they learn from their own experience of capitalism. How much closer we would be to socialism today if all those who spend their time advocating 'transitional demands' were on our side! &#x200B; Marx's (and the Socialist Party's) conception of the working class as all those who have to sell their labour power, from road sweepers to computer programmers, is inconvenient to members of vanguard groups, who often believe that they themselves are not members of the working class, whilst admitting that it is the working class which must achieve socialism. 'The workers' cannot grasp anything so 'abstract' as socialism, it is claimed. But the exponents of vanguardism do understand it, or so they say.Evidently then, they are not workers: they are the 'intelligentsia' or 'middle class'. They constitute the officer corps. The workers are the instrument, but they wield the instrument. Socialism is a paper hoop through which the working class, performing circus animals, must be coaxed to jump. They are the ringmasters. Or, as their hero Trotsky saw it, the masses are the steam, and the leadership is the piston which gives the steam direction. This notion that they are not members of the working class explains why these people sometimes say to socialists: 'What are you doing to get in among the working class?' The socialist worker who is only too chronically and daily aware that they are in and of the working class finds such idealism baffling but entirely consistent with the general confusion exhibited by reform-peddling leaders everywhere.

The half truth of 'FAKE NEWS',Anarchism,"I think 'Fake News' is one of the biggest threats to pushing a left agenda \*that isn't about democrats\* in the united states. I've discussed this with trump supporters and found that it's a great opportunity to create empathy and possibly pull a disenfranchised person away from the alt-right and put them with the left....or at least just a libertarian that likes to blaze up. I began getting into activism a few years before occupy. You KNOW I was all up in occupy. Man that year and a half was great. The discussions! The spectacles! The massive amounts of information. &#x200B; That information that no one got. The biggest thing that I constantly heard was how there wasn't a 'cohesive message'. However, there had literally been manifestos written on a national and local level from all versions of occupy. All occupies agreeing on core issues with variants for local needs and wants. Yet time and time again I was hit with 'there's no focus, what do you even want?' Over and over I was met with shock when I directed people to information. In the eyes of the media, it was just a bunch of angry people that we don't really understand...but MAN THEY ARE FIRED UP. This is the 24hr news cycle. This is what we fight against. **THERE IS FAKE NEWS. THE NEWS IS TOTALLY FAKE**. Look at Anderson Cooper getting on his knees in a hurricane to make the flooding worse, or go back to people having no idea what occupy is going on about. The news serves the corporate masters, and be it right or left, they don't look out for populist ideas, nor will they report on ideas that directly conflict with their stock holders. This falls right in with the do nothing attitude of most democrats. **DO NOT CONFUSE SOFT LIBERALISM AND WHITE GUILT WITH CHANGE.** This is nothing new for activists. This has been going on for as long as propaganda has been a thing. However, now our current president is taking pages out of the Kremlin's playbook. Using something as unspoken, and yet widely felt, as fake news to cover REAL lies. It hurts left activists by having people simultaneously defending the media \*to argue against trump\* while knowing that it's bullshit. These feelings of disenfranchisement have been in the working class for so long it just took a skeeze ball to use them against the people. It has created such a veil of disinformation that I have actually had people arguing that 'you weren't there you wouldn't know' when talking about basic scientific information. I'm not sure what we can do to swing this for us. Like I said having conversations from this angle tends to open up trumpers to what you may have to say, and perhaps we can learn that we really just all hate capitalism and we've all been brainwashed.",a5z3iq,self.Anarchism,,True

If refusal is common with supporters would there be force involved? Would everything dissolve? Is entering into something corrupt make you corrupt? If there was a 'anarchist party' in the first place, do you think that the meaning would be diminished, or would it aid the cause? Please let me know how you feel about this... I believe Anarchism and it's properties should be talked about in a proactive way, way more. I barely hear the word or its meanings outside of Reddit and the internet. I will try my best without haste to sway people to believe the truth to why Anarchism is something we need more of! With or without the government! I NEED YOUR HELP! DEATH IS COMING TO ALL WHO MERRILY KILL THE POOR WITH POWER! DEATH IS COMING TO THE ONES WHO SUPPORT THEM WITH THEIR WRONGDOINGS! JUSTICE IS NONEXISTENT! We will all stay focused without a doubt for we will be called on when the time is right. That time is coming, and a dark cloud is following. I am with you all even if you disagree with me...

No Olympics until you solve homelessness Salt Lake City!,Anarchism,"With 1/10 the resources, maybe 1/100 of the resources needed to put on an Olympics -- the literal engineering, construction, financial instrumentation, the oodles of volunteer labor, etc etc etc -- Utah could solve it's homelessness problem before the Olympics even started. And it was that way in 2002. Since then we got Palmer Court and at least one other 'permanent' homeless shelter, and there were promises we were gonna get more, but that train seems to have all but stopped (Palmer Court is too hard to run or some shit). The busywork of replacing the jumbo temporary homeless shelter with a series of smaller ones that combined have LESS capacity than the existing jumbo one is taking all the wind out of more productive work; i.e., the new shelters have no chance of reducing the street homelessness and will probably exacerbate that problem which is pretty much the worst problem. Here we are, still alternating between neglecting then terrorizing our most vulnerable people on the streets, taking two steps forward two steps back if we do anything at all, letting our sick and sometimes crazy brothers and sisters toil in the weather and wind, and we have the muddy souls to put on another session of the globe's most elaborate fun-time event.

A story about people and the houseless,Anarchism,"Yesterday as I was going to work I spotted this houseless woman sitting on a bench in the cold on a busy street. She looked about 60. She tried to talk to all the people who passed by her, but she was ignored by each one. They didn't even look at her. So I walked up to her and asked what she wanted. She told me she was blind and that she had been trying to get to the tram stop for more than an hour. I said I would help her, and led her to the stop. It wasn't far, only about a five minute walk. As we walked, the people walking by us looked at us with disgust. The way people treat the houseless makes me want to get physically violent. But that's not even the worst of it. When we reached the tram stop, and she told me that she wanted to go the other direction I did, so I had to tell her I couldn't help her the whole way. And I felt fucking ashamed that I couldn't help her more, all because of a fear of being late, of being reprimanded or even losing my job. It bothers me to think about how she may not have even gotten to where she wanted to, because when she reached her stop and got off the tram nobody helped her, just as nobody did before. The help I gave her only took about a minute out of my day. Anybody could have done that. It wasn't hard or even inconvenient. I can't wrap my head around how people can act like this. That houseless person could be your own mother or it could even be you. Even if you can't or don't want to help them, you should at least listen to what they say, and not ignore them completely.",a8kklj,self.Anarchism,,True

"How I explained violence to my mother, who was troubled by the idea of revolution.",Anarchism,"DISCLAIMER: I have changed some language in order to respect the rules of Reddit, namely altering what could be considered calls of violence. Just know that in some very small ways, what I actually said was a bit more *guilloteney* Violence is inherently bad, but it's how power is manifested. It's actual definition and function is the manifestation of power. If I punch somebody in the face, I am using whatever power I have physically to affect them somehow. If I sit in on a construction site, and I am arrested, that is the police using power given to them by those who hold power over them to move me against my will. When Congress passes an act of war, and sends us to go kill other people just like us, the consequence for refusal is arrest, and that is people in power of multiple countries then using their power to send entire populations to kill each other for the sole reason of hoarding power. Violence is inherently bad, but it's not the image you seem to have in your head. Violence is any way power manifests, which means the starvation of the poor is literal violence by the rich. The arrest of protesters is violence by the rich. The murder of Kashoggi and millions of others is violence by the rich. The fact that nobody is punished for any of the thousands of acts of violence against the poor within the past two years is violence by the rich. Saudi Arabian leadership should have been punished for the war in Yemen. American leadership should have been punished for the war in Yemen. Russian leadership should have been punished for the war in Yemen. Because of all of them, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been slaughtered in their homes by people sent from other countries. But we continue to let them wield power over us. And if we question them, if we challenge them, we are given arrest, and we are given incarceration, so they continue to arrest us so they can profit, and they continue to send us to kill each other because nobody is stopping them. Violence is the manifestation of power, and power is bad. It follows that violence is bad. So why are we letting them do this to us? Why are we letting these people lead when they've killed so many millions in only a few years? The only way for us to force altruism in leadership is to use collective power on them. We need to say 'you will serve us, not yourself, or you will be removed from power and punished for our deaths.' But we do nothing. The French people have started resisting. We in America do nothing. Nothing. Our leadership are criminals against humanity. And we are content ranting online, marching passively, and letting nothing happen. We will all die because of this. I will not die being content with this disgusting, indignitizing, dehumanizing death. I will die laying my body on the gears, and on the wheels, and on the levers of the machine, and I will say to them, 'Unless I am free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.' And if I die without my freedom, fine. But I will not die because I was not free and did nothing. I will die because I was not free, and demanded freedom.",a5a2ch,self.Anarchism,,True

How might we warm people up to anarchism and socialism?,Anarchism,"I'm sure the vast majority of you know by now that it is practically impossible to get the average person to discuss, reasonably, anarchism. The moment you mention the word, you are met with clichés such as 'Government is a necessary evil,' 'Anarchy is chaos,' 'But we as a society consent to government.' The same happens when we express our anti-capitalist stances, except replace *chaos* with *evil* and *anarchy* with *socialism*. The whole issue seems primarily semantic. I was discussing this with an open-minded friend of mine, and she, a liberal, agreed. When I explained to her the general ideas of anarchism, she wholeheartedly agreed with the bottom-up approach. Perhaps it's necessary to drop these terms in favor for something with less negative connotations? Obviously, *libertarian* has been repurposed, and adding the prefix *social-* onto anything brings to mind the atrocities of Stalin and Co. What remains are two forms of anarchism, mutualism and syndicalism. So long as you go without saying 'anarcho-' I've found the reaction is generally non-hostile. The problem is these terms are exclusive to very specific types of anarchism, whereas it'd be better promoting anarchism (minus ancapism) as a whole. Any suggestions?",ab125y,self.Anarchism,,True

How we starved for 5 days in prison?,Anarchism,"This all happened in the summer of 1999. I was charged with urder as a 16 year old teenager and I spent my time with similar young evil fuckers in juveniles prison. It was a fucking hot summer and we all went a bit crazy there. As I've written in one of my stories before - brand clothes was second money in prison. Every teenager wanted to get better clothes from other prisoners, just to show off or to change them for cigarettes, vodka or whatever. Clothes were textile currency of prison. &#x200B; The clothes were all written down one by one on our personal items card. The guards did occasionally check our stuff if we still have our items. If not: Where are they? We had to write confessions like 'Its broken and 'I threw it away'. It was cool then and you didn't get punished. You were not allowed to change clothes between inmates. Of course the snitches told sometimes to guards that they were emptied in prison transportation car. One day our chamber ws searched by guards. They came to check our clothes.After this shit was over they confiscted like 3 huge bags of brand clothes and footwear from 5 of us. Our explenation was that when we came from our courts, from local city police station, the guard didn't write them down. He just forgot, its not my fault. They didn't believe us and confiscated everything. We were a punch of young idiots who took some crazy idea and did it - no matter the aftermath. We started to refuse to take food and made an official paper to director, that fuck your food - we demand our clothes! Starving underaged prisoners is not a news that any director wants people outside of prison to read or hear. We had phonecalls allowed but director refused to give them immediatly and it wasn't our plan. We just refusedb food first day. Fuck em, we had some tea, some cookies, some sugar replacement and 1 'Gallina Blanca' fast soup for 2 persons. We boiled water, feasted and laughed at the guards in our luck. We were all 15-17 years old, 5 guys with heavy crimes.We were all also in our growing ages and fucking starving and horny 24/7! We refused the food on second day aswell, we had tea and sugar replacement pills. These little round pills, too sweet, I would say. But we were hanging and still feeling ok. &#x200B; The director came and we told him the same story - the guards are lazy and they don't write things down - why should we suffer? Our mothers and fathers also work hard to buy these things, we have long sentences coming, preparing more clothes and so on. He was a dick and stayed on his position. Third day was fucked up. We were all weak and feeded mostly from hot water and sugar replacements pills. I got nausea and I threw up many times because of the chemical taste of this sweet hot water I was drinking. The stomach was empty and emptied itself to end. Then I got some seizures in my stomach for a while. Not so good feeling. &#x200B; The doctors started to come and measure our blood pressure and blood sugar and who knows what. We got some sweets from her but we still refused food. The guards are always bastards! Usually we refuse food when the little hole in the door was opened. They closed it and left the food on the corridor for 2 hours (due to some law). After two hours we were asked again, we refused and the food left with the delivery guy. On the 4th day these fuckers started to leave the food on next to the opening in the door and they didn't close it for 2 hours. For 2 hours we smelled the food that smelled better than any Michelin restaurants food. The food was like shit usually but now it even tasted so good without tasting it. It made us mad and more weaked. Of course we were all weak and tired of it. We didn't have the power to fall asleep, our inside was puked to toilet and no good spirit was up in the air anymore. Before the morning alarm at 6 o'clock next morning the door was opened very carefully. We thought the doctor came to check us and didn't even move ourselves in our beds. But then I heard 3 dropping noises - our bags!!! Fuck yeah - where's the breakfast??? :) &#x200B; The director had called to prison at 5 o'clock in the morning and said to the guards on duty in that evening: 'Fuck, I have 16 year old son sleeping in his bed, he will eat in the morning and so will these guys - give them back their stufF and double fruits for all of them! &#x200B; We were happy - our resistance had worked!

Competence Hierarchy and Anarchism,Anarchism,"I am not an anarchist, but I've followed r/Anarchism since making my Reddit account because I'm interested in the topic. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that a major part of anarchism is eliminating hierarchies. I would like to know how an anarchist society would eliminate hierarchies of competence or stop hierarchies of competence from developing in society. It seems that a natural pecking order develops in groups of people working towards the same goal based on individuals' abilities to contribute towards that goal. I am a student and see this manifest in group projects. Those with a more clear sense of direction or more knowledge on the subject naturally rise to a leadership position. This is because those with less ability/knowledge on the subject look to those with more ability/knowledge for guidance as everyone trudges towards the same goal. One might say that the leadership position is abolished at the end of the group project, and this is what would happen once the ideal society is realized. I recognize that point, but it seems to me that keeping a society functional is a neverending project. &#x200B; I'm asking because I am genuinely curious.",a6i4td,self.Anarchism,,True

Was Anarres really anarchist?,Anarchism,"A book I hold very dear to my heart, and radicalised me towards Anarchism/Libertarian Socialism is Ursula K Le Guin's The Dispossessed. The society on Anarres fascinated me greatly and led me to read her other works based in the Hainish/Ekumen universe, with other great works such as The Left Hand of Darkness and The Word for World is Forest - which I highly recommend. One thing I've always been confused about though is how Anarres is meant to be anarchist, since: 1) the society is closed off, has it's own planet and strict borders. Nobody is allowed to leave or enter except mineral exporters that transport minerals off-world to Urras in exchange for other goods. 2) hasn't completely gotten rid of hierarchy since it has some sort of central committee which acts like quasi-judicial panel. 3) Is incredibly suspicious of different opinions and dissent to the point it ostracizes those who are different. 4) still has some form of prison system. They don't overtly call it that in the book, but it's pretty obvious one of the characters is sent to one for 'psychological evaluation'. 5) Anarres survives by the grace of Urras, which can invade at any time and therefore can you say that the Anarresi are truly free? I also don't understand how the society is seen as an example of Anarcho-Syndicalism, since there are no trade unions. It strikes me more that they practice a form of communism. Obviously, no society can be truly perfect or free, and I understand Le Guin's message was to show that revolution is a constant battle. What are your opinions?",a9nny8,self.Anarchism,,True

Hierarchies in organised religion must be abolished for progress in the MENA region.,Anarchism,"I'm a leftist Muslim and thankfully was able to un-learn the cultural dogma instilled from the ages of Colonialism. I have studied Islamic history and the teaching, then moved to research other Abrahamic religions. Organisation of religious authorities has ruined progress which corrupted shared teachings of Charity, altruism and community. For example, in Islam where charity a main tenant thus is compulsory for the rich as to prevent the hording of resources, weather and land. Which is then redistributed to the working class to prevent poverty. 'Islamic'nations love to shove dogma in its struggling population's faces with their Holier than Thou capitalist brand of religion as a tool to oppress the people. It stagnanted us for generations with learned prejudice that further divided us. Only way to stop this is by abolishing these hierarchies without causing a crisis of faith in the region. I can see the good that religion does to help cope with existential dread and improve ones life through spirituality but it's been bastardised by imperialism and greed.

"Probably belongs better on r/NoStupidQuestions, but do Anarchists support government provided healthcare?",Anarchism,"From what I learned from Crimethinc, the Anarchist wiki/101/that big ass document with like, 90 paragraphs, the state can't be trusted with jack shit and shouldn't exist anyway. Therefore, government supported healthcare just gets in the way of actually getting healthcare while bungling things up. From what I learned from some tumblr blogs, Social Democracy as it is with the Global North relies on exploiting the global south and free healthcare is just 'Can we have medicine, please, Rich people?' with a side of 'still capitalism' I'm researching Hillary so I actually fully know why she's terrible rather than relying on my poor memory to provide 'uhhhhhh military something' any time I try to remember. I see she supported a law for employers to provide healthcare and Chip. Theoretically this is good if again, it wasn't for the state. I make sure I have my facts right. I go on tumblr because sometimes I don't want to read theory right away, and Kroptokchristain (Make Anarchy Lovey Dovey Again) is saying government supplied healthcare is good.

Anarchism Vs. Super Heroism,Anarchism,"So with all this media attention about Aquaman right now in lieu of the new film, I wanted to bring up the differences I see between Anarchism and super heroes. Super heroes, and heroines, in the way that I see them are propaganda tools. I've actually stopped caring and watching movies starring some kind of super hero/ine figure. What are the differences between an act of Anarchism and super heroism, and why does the media just love shoving heroes down our throats? (For the sake of time I'm usually using the word 'hero' gender neutrally unless specifically talking about a hero or heroine in particular). Super hero comics really took off during WWII. They gave people a lot of hope and inspiration. They modeled all the great ideals of Justice that America was upholding across the pond by laying waste to Nazis. They depicted freedom, strength, morale, and virtues. All qualities that exemplified a true American. The example of an American that was instilled in generations of young and old alike. This example really had an impact and brought to the table qualities that we could all strive for. A sort of, 'What would Jesus do?' Pontification that replaced a Christ figure with Superman, Captain America, Batman, etc. In old comics, these heroes were seen fighting fascist leaders and sparking rebellion against immoral and villainous nationalist countries. There's an ever popular Superman graphic where he's literally punching a Nazi. So what happened? Fast forward to the 21st century. Now we see heroes fighting villains that burn money, (see Dark Knight. Rest in peace Health you sweet prince) villains that wish to depict the control and propaganda of modern media, (see Incredibles 2), and villains that want to use technology to stick it to the Man who's keeping them down (see Spider Man: Homecoming). What do these say of modern media? One could say that they're showing how villains might not actually be all that bad. One might also argue that they're showing that villainy comes in the form of rebellion. Trying to change the status quo. Well which is it? Maybe we need to investigate what makes a hero to really know. Heroes and heroines. We all grew up with them. Comics, cartoons, action figures, video games, movies, t-shirts, lunch boxes, and when underwear, all garnished and embellished by loud and bright depictions of various heroes. It seemed like everywhere I looked there was some everyday object that expressed an image of a hero in the middle of some great act or someone's chest complimented by a logo of their favorite hero or heroine. The origin stories of many of these heroes varies, but for a large chunk of them, one factor rings true. Bloodline. Bloodlines play a major role in a lot of heroes and heroine origins. Superman? born of royal blood. Batman? Born of rich blood and inherited billions (sound familiar?). And even the paragon of feminine heroines, Wonder Woman. Also born of royal blood. Of course there are those that are just normal people like Spiderman. He was bitten by a special spider and made into who he is now. And our oh so handsome Jason Mamoa playing yet another royal hero. What does this teach people subversively? What does this teach children? In most cases, what it takes to be a hero isn't something that is worked for. It's something you're just born into, and usually only for the rich, royal, and in the case of Spiderman and those who share similar origins, in the right place at the right time. Even though heroes are everywhere the conditions to being one are so random and privileged that you might as well not even try to be one if you don't have money and power already just handed down to you through blood. What about villains? Surely if heroism is inherited, the one thing that can oppose them is an equally powerful and also inherited strength but used in the immoral ways of villainy? That's where I see a contrast. Let's look at some modern villains. The Joker. If we're going with the original story, he's a guy who put on a suit with a red hood. Batman ended up through a series of events inadvertently leading him into a vat of acid to which Red Hood became Joker. If we're going with our fine prince Heath's Joker, he's just a mystery man who just wants to burn money and cause chaos to corrupt the dark Knight into being an unrighteous bourgeoisie that he is during his time out of the cave. The Screen Slaver from Incredibles 2 comes from privileged rich blood, but she is a self made villainess (although one could argue not since she inherited money and used it to make gadgets) her message is that society is too reliant on heroes to swoop in and save them. Sound familiar to our government? Michael Keaton's villain, Vulture, is a struggling laborer who's just trying to get by while being held down by an oppressive government. It seems that villains come from a more varied background than heroes. Some are self made. Some inherit the power for villainy. Yet a lot of them see an issue with the status quo and wish to change it, whereas heroes wish it remain the same. We work. Society works hard. We pay our taxes, our labor is unjustly underpaid to provide a profit while given empty promises that the government will provide us social security when we age and will no longer be able to provide for ourselves. All the while we're actually fattening the wallets of the bourgeoisie and by the time millennials are old, who knows if the social security systems will be around? Or even the planet? All the while we're pressed under the weight of credit card debt, student loan debt, rent payments, car payments, increasing food and fuel prices etc etc. The heroes (government) are not going to save us. There are no billionaire Batmans donning a black suit. No royal aliens who believe in truth and Justice. No royal women working to support the everyday person. No ONE person will save us. Acts of real heroism are carried out by a group of diverse individuals working together for one noble cause. Together we are heroes. Together we are strong. There are no heroes. We are only heroes together. Nique la police. ",a6nk4z,self.Anarchism,,True

Tell me about Anarchism,Anarchism,"Anti-capitalist here. I feel like the reason communism (well, socialism) keeps failing is due to it necessarily being tied to a dictatorial state, which then – surprise, surprise – becomes corrupt and oppressive. Hence, I'm curious about anarchism (of the left-wing variety, fuck the AnCaps), as it represents an alternative to both socialism and capitalism. I must admit, I know next to nothing about anarchism, so I thought I'd ask you guys to give me a beginner's introduction. What's the basic design of an anarchist society (no state, duh, but what else do you feel is important to mention?) and what do you advocate FOR (rather than against, which is pretty clear in the sub's description)? What's the anarchist approach to dealing with global warming? What would you consider anarchism's biggest pit falls?

People are fucking obsessed with seeing others get beat by the police.,Anarchism,"I subscribe to some pages on reddit that typically make light out of negative situations. Things like r/instantkarma. Lately I’ve started to develop some rough anxiety related to a health issue, coupled with an inability to sleep regular hours, so I watch these videos to kind of calm down/slowly build up to eventually sleeping. Silly, I know. But, one of the biggest fucking things on pages like that, is seriously grotesque bootlicking of people being beaten or threatened by the police. I’m not kidding. Two minutes before I made this post, I watched some idiot bounce around on top of a car because his sports team won, only to then be violently beaten by the police. I mean, Jesus Christ. I get it, he’s dumb, he did something stupid. Fantastic. Where and what exactly occurred that he needed his teeth knocked out and his face and back to be beaten by iron batons? I think people fantasize and enjoy this kind of content because everyone knows on some level it could be them, next. Should they step out of line, the law would find them and punish them with the exact same brutality. So people relish in physical violence against others by police institutions as a means of siding with the bullies to save themselves from becoming prey targets. Isn’t that fucking disturbing? We all know deep down that the guns and nightsticks and boots and riot shields don’t actually have limits. They never did. A cop could kill you today, tomorrow, next week, and it wouldn’t fucking make him so much as blink. Because they’re an occupying force, an armed power over the people who can do anything and everything they desire, from forcing their victims into sexually comprising situations to avoid tickets they can’t pay, to beating someone senseless for the a moment of stupid but human horseplay.

I saw how a guy died in prison bus,Anarchism,"&#x200B; We all have done or know someone who has done drugs. Some of us get more hooked than others. Estonia is a little country with the 3rd highest drug over dose rate in the world. Fentanyl is taking down approximetly 100 lives, mostly young Russians... &#x200B; I was in prison once for having 100 gr of amphetamine, some weed and ecstacy in my car. Stupid late teenager as I was - nothing to be proud of. The court was harsh and they gave me 6,4 years in prison. It was year 2007, I guess, and I was located in Tartu prison. It's the second largest and the first modern prison in Baltic states. We called it just Alcatraz because in the spring when the rivers go over their beds and overfloat the prison area, which was a swamp. So the prison is in the middle of water and it looks like Alcatraz from above. New prisons have usually new well-tought guards. Well-tought means they have no such thing as human thinking and every step and act they do is brainwashed so deep in their minds - prison robots. I was being transfered from Tartu prison to prison of Tallinn. The buses where all the inmates were transfered was like a DHL van, but it had metal cages inside. Every inmate had his own metal box with uncomfortable chair and usually you were handcuffed to metal wall aswell. &#x200B; This time we were 7 of us inmates and 4 guards on the way to Tallinn. Before the bus took off from Tartu we saw how guards and medical staff is lifting a body inside the prison van. I saw the guys face who was just gathered from his hospital bed with the lineans still under him - the only way to carry this almost dead body. We heard that he had AIDS and his immunity level is down to 17 units... this means this poor guy was already stepping out of this life when they decided to transfer him to prison hospital with our car. A simple way for officials not to fill the annoying papers of dead inmate. We started our trip to Tallinn, capital of Estonia. The distance between Tartu and Tallinn is about 180 km. With this bullet proov death van its almost 2,5-3 hour drive. On the half way we heard how the sick guy was asking for water in Russian. The guards just told him it's not allowed. He was begging again for water and they shouted to shut a fuck up - no water. The smell was aweful inside the car, it was a smell of all the released liquids of a dying man and he still begged a zip of water from the guards and we ll started to raise our voices to support him. 'You fucking animals, give the man some water, you fat fucks!' We were mad at this shit. No matter who you are, this is unfare, unhuman and I really wish them to suffer for what they did. Finally one of the dick heads stood up and took a desinfection spray with minty smell and alcohol and just sprayed it on this guy who was already dying... What an asshole!!! He died in the van before we reached the hospital. The smell was so bad that some of us threw up. We had to wait long time in the prison hospital and our ride was 4 hours long. No water, no toilet - just dead body and punch of fucking sick human beings who go by the name of freedom guard in Estonia. Some guys tried to write to newspapers from prison later about this shit, but ofcourse - nothing... Drugs are really fun and cool, but less is more and you don't have to do them all. After seeing shit like this I stick to weed and psychedelics. After all, life is the outcome of our choices - I chose not do live like this anymore. &#x200B; Choose peace, weed and brains",a4kmxk,self.Anarchism,,True

Today was my last day at the office,Anarchism,"Two years ago I accepted a job that eventually drained my soul. My previous job was at a grocery store, so I thought it was an upgrade. I thought I would do more 'meaningful' work there. You know what I did most of the time? Literally nothing. We didn't even produce the products we were selling. We were middlemen, doing paperwork and computer work, selling things that we supposedly owned but never really saw. And 9 out of 12 months of the years were slow as hell and my boss hardly gave me or my co-workers anything to do. Needless to say, I've watched a lot of YouTube the past year and discovered a lot of leftist creators. I realized just how unfair and inefficient and senseless capitalism is. I realized that I was benefiting from the cheap labor that actually processed the products we sold. And I felt guilty. And also completely lifeless, because I wasn't doing anything at that job. I imagined working there for another few years, and I could stand the thought of it. So I'm done with them, and I don't have anything else lined up. (This wasn't on whim btw, I've been planning this for months). I've applied to a few places, but no interviews yet. I do feel a little nervous about this, but I have a little financial cushion in case I can't find a job right away. I know I can't escape capitalism, so I probably won't find a perfectly ethical job, but maybe I'll find something better. Something that helps people. Some place where I can feel a little happier and more proud of the work I do, even if it's just making coffee for people or helping someone at the grocery store. Maybe even a place I could help unionize. Or maybe I'll find a few people to start a co-op with eventually. I was starting to 'succeed' in capitalism: doing very little work for not a small amount of money. I got so unmotivated and used to doing hardly any work, and that mentality seeped into my non-work life. I stopped writing. I stopped making things. I stopped being creative.

Is there a term for someone who wants a world in which states and stateless people/territory coexist and people have the option to choose their own adventure?,Anarchism,"I'm talking vision and ideals here. Like, what would you call an anarchist who wants a world in which any people who truly want to live under a state have that as a real option they can choose and then even opt out of again, as casually as some people are able to move from city to city within a state, a world in which people can move from states to stateless territories, with relative ease. I'm talking vision and ideals here, so I realize in our current world these things are mucked up by privilege and hierarchy, but in an ideal situation there would be a lot more egalitarianism and hopefully everyone would have the privilege to migrate if they choose, and sample both state-run and stateless communities. This comes from a sense that I have that a lot of people truly do not want stateless societies, I'm sorry y'all, I know that's not popular to say, but that's just my feeling that a lot of people do not want what we want, they want states, they want hierarchies, and it's not just because of their conditioning and habit in all cases, I feel weird telling them they shan't have them and shame on you for wanting that lol, and I feel weird telling you all that I believe this, but there it is.

Contradiction in working for Peace Corps?,Anarchism,"I am currently in my junior year of college and looking into my options for work after I graduate. I really like the idea of going into the Peace Corps because they seem to do good work and I want to serve humanity for the rest of my life. I think the Peace Corps provides a good foundation of skills that I can transfer to local organizing and non profit work upon my return. I am hesitant though for a few reasons: 1) The Peace Corps is funded by the US govt and the idea is to promote American ideals abroad. I think the US govt is responsible for a lot of death and destruction and wonder about the moral implications of my serving them. 2) I'm a straight white guy and I think the whole 'privileged westerner roughing it with the indigenous folk' image is pretty cringey. 3) I am a triple major with a 3.9 GPA. This could potentially open powerful doors, I don't know. I wonder if there's a better way for me to contribute to the general welfare of humanity.

"A rant about 'individual action doesn't do anything, you're just one person'",Anarchism,"This argument is how complacency and stagnation are born. What are we as individuals capable of, if not individual action? How do we contribute to change, if not as individuals? How do we either feed or fight the system, if not with our individual labor? Individual action is the only kind of action we alone are capable of taking. Sure, if only one individual takes action, then the effects may be disappointing. But what happens when one person does something that needs to be done, and then, one by one, others realize, 'If I join them, I could do this too, and we can make change come.' And then, another, and another, until a movement has arisen, bringing change, and hope, and righteousness in a perpetually dark world. I wonder how often one person does something that needs to be done, but they are left alone in doing it, because everybody else who would have done it dismissed it by thinking, 'I'm just one person, my presence won't make a difference.' Revolutions happen when enough people decide, 'Yes, I will be a part of this change.' And then, change comes for them.",a9v9db,self.Anarchism,,True

Because I don't get enough hate mail - I think we put way too much emphasis on the 'old masters.',Anarchism,"I use the term 'old masters' as a shorthand for the radical leftist writers of the 18th and early 19th centuries. The more to the radical left I've moved in my life, the more I've made a conscious effort to study the works of people like Marx, Bakunin, Goldman, Stirner, Engels, Kropotkin, etc. In doing this, one thing has continuously stood out to me; the texts are insipidly boring. Marx especially is the literary equivalent of eating wallpaper paste seasoned with flour and while Das Kapital may be a seminal work on the examination of the function of capitalism, I daresay it's dry enough to make leather out of any fruit placed in proximity to a copy. That would be excusable if the ideas contained within were, generally speaking, succinct and more importantly grounded in a sense of understanding of the modern world. They paint an excellent picture of 18th and 19th century Europe or America from a radical perspective but they lack a foundation of their ideas that rests in a world where means of communication, production, and collaboration exist now that were science fiction at best during their time. What's more, the majority of the people doing the writing were of one particular class of individual. Say what you will about them having a thorough understanding of the nature of the relationship between labor and capital, virtually none of the old radicals (save perhaps Goldman) had any conception of modern issues of social justice and doubtless would be utterly confused about the modern conversations going on around issues like LGBTQ+ and identity. Their ideas, if articulated verbatim today, would be brocialism at best. As much as this sounds like a condemnation, it's important to remember that these people were truly radical *for their time* and should be viewed in that light despite their views having moved from radical to almost regressive given our current understanding. From my perspective, I feel like we as a community place far too much emphasis on reading and understanding these works. We do so largely at the expense of a rich body of modern work, much of it available for free or for little cost, that contains perspectives and understanding that the old guard sorely lacked and make people who devote themselves to studying these texts all the poorer for not having them. They promulgate a 'class is all that matters' perspective on radical politics which, in my experience at least, produces people who can ably debate the relationship between Hegelian Marxism and Individualism Anarchism but who are beyond baffled at the idea that there are more than two genders and grump about 'idpol' or are firmly convinced Gamergate really was about the integrity of gaming journalism. I feel that with the power of communication and the internet that we have today, there exists more than enough capacity to produce the foundational ideas of the various schools of anarchism without launching into a lengthy diatribe about how long young women work per day in spinning mills or pages upon pages of statistics for years that (most of) our grandparents weren't even around to see. I don't think we should throw these texts out wholesale, it's important to remember the foundation of many of these ideas, but it seems that these would be best served as intellectual exercises at best rather than texts of first resort. In short, I think it's of more value to find texts that are more rooted in a contemporary understanding of radical politics and the world at large. And no, I don't have any in mind.

More liberal nonsense,Anarchism,"Found this gem in the book 'america's secret jihad' where they attempt to show that anarchists and white christian nationalist or islamic terrorists are equivalent because the latter have latched onto what they perceive as the ideas of propaganda of the deed: >The Christian Identity movement found the perfect partner for the revolutionary, guerrilla warfare it predicted in the Minutemen. The group’s membership and financial support appeared to increase after 1965. It was also an organization with national reach and a legacy of paramilitary training, Formed in 1960, supposedly by a group of duck hunters who wanted to prepare an insurgency against a future communist takeover, the group believed that “any further effort, time or money spent in trying to save our country by political means would be wasted. . . . Therefore the objectives of the Minutemen are to abandon useless efforts and begin immediately to prepare for the day when Americans will once again fight in the streets for their lives and their liberty. We feel there is overwhelming evidence to prove that this day must come.” ^25 >Led by Robert Bolivar DePugh, a middle-aged businessman and biochemist from Missouri with strong organizational skills, the group did not at first embrace the strategy of provoking or instigating that day when, as Swift predicted in his sermon, “Americans will once again fight in the streets for their lives and liberty.” Known to students of terrorism as the propaganda of the deed, this strategy has been traced to anarcho-terrorists who attacked Western targets, including those in the United States, from the 1870s through the 1930s. “One deed is worth more than 10,000 pamphlets,” one anarchist famously insisted. The idea was not only that actions speak louder than words but that those actions could elicit the kind of retribution from a target that would illustrate the ultimate goal of an ideological terrorist group. >For the anarcho-terrorists, this meant encouraging the state to crack down oppressively on its population in its hunt for subversive terrorists, proving the capacity for tyranny and violence that anarchists insisted was endemic to any government. For modern-day Islamic terrorists, it means baiting the West into invading Muslim nations to reveal to potential recruits and the Muslim world at large that the United States and its allies are enemies of Islam.

How best to organize at my university,Anarchism,"Hello all, So I go to UMass Amherst, and the political situation is getting pretty dire there. There is an increasing right wing/white supremacist presence on campus, and it’s making people of color, Jews, and LGBT+ students on campus feel uncomfortable and frankly unsafe. Swastikas have been drawn on bedroom doors of minority students in various different dorms on campus. The police have been anonymously called on random, innocent people of color for looking “suspicious” when they’re just going about their business. Slurs and racist death threats have been written in various places on campus. Members of the white supremacist group Identity Europa have put posters and stickers up around campus not only to intimidate but to spread their ideology. Not to mention, the administration doesn’t really seem to want to do anything other than add more cameras and police. They have nice PR anti racist campaigns, but in practice, they’ve done next to nothing to prevent this from happening. Just recently, someone put a sign in their dorm window that said something along the lines of “Fuck Nazis, You’re Not Welcome Here.” In response, one of the residence directors emailed the person who made the sign and asked them to take it down, on the grounds that “it made some people worried about campus inclusion.” I’m sick of this, this is so ass-backwards I don’t even know where to begin.

When does the settler group become the indigenous group?

We also see the Latin peoples pushing the Etruscans and Celtic peoples out of North Italy and now are considered the indigenous population to all of Italy. In Africa we see the Arabic peoples through the northern third of Africa who pushed out the native kushite people and numidians.

Why I think we should care about the Trump stuff happening right now,Anarchism,"So there seems to be a trend of opinion recently that we as anarchists are 'above' everything happening right now with Trump. Who cares if Russia meddled in US elections when the US does the same thing and worse to every other country around the world. People might be paying attention to the immigration tragedies happening with Trump but that's just because they weren't paying attention to the tragedies happening under Obama. Sure they might be tons of corruption in the Trump admin but that's just because they aren't as good at hiding it as everyone else and being more brazen. &#x200B; Sure, I agree with all of that, but I think we're on the verge of something happening, a liminal period in history, and specifically one that presents us with opportunities we can use to make massive gains in a short period of time for very little effort expended. Here's my thinking: We seem to be rapidly approaching a moment where it seems possible for Trump to lose support from even his most loyal supporters. He is being exposed as a grifter who is caving on things like 'The Wall' that his alt right conservative racist followers have put all their faith in. Sooner or later, it will come crashing down, just like Nixon, and eventually enough of his base will abandon him that it will reach a critical mass. When he becomes more of a liability than an asset, the GOP will jump ship and throw him under the bus. Eventually his followers will have to do an about face and pretend they always knew he was a con man, ala The Iraq War and nobody admits their fervent support they had for it almost two decades ago, when (as thsoe of you who were around back then will remember) we were some of the very very few who spoke out against it and were in return condemned and threatened for doing so. &#x200B; The thing is though, there are ideas in in the alt-right that have a basis in reality, but just with some details filled in with racist/sexist/queerphobic bigotry. For example, yes there is a tiny group of powerful people who control much of the world in sociopathic manner for their own benefit at the expense of everyone else, but we just know its the rich capitalist ruling class, rather than fabricated anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Even their hunches about the ruling class elites having habits of pedophilia has a basis in reality, see Epstein, Franklin Pedo Ring, etc. Now, as their constructed reality starts to collapse in on itself, they will seek a new stable one. It will take quite a bit of energy (as in a generic term for effort required to overcome resistance) for them to abandon so many of their prior views in order to rejoin the supposed deep state they have designated as their mortal enemy. I believe it to require so much energy for them to swing from alt-right trumpist viewpoint back to neoliberal viewpoint, that in fact there will be a point where it will actually cost them LESS energy to instead swing to a leftist anti-state anti-capitalist viewpoint. Instead of having to go from 'Everyone I believed in was wrong and just grifting me, and everyone I was against was actually right', there's a possibility for them to 'tunnel through to the other side' so to speak, as in 'I had the right ideas about many things, but Trump and the alt-right were part of the ruling elites and just one more set of grifters, now I see my true affinity is for the global working class, and all ruling elites are my enemy'. &#x200B; I really do think that with the right encouragement, there's we can encourage them to 'lean into the curve', and will have an easier time bringing them to our side through careful precise portrayals of conspiracy theories that guide their viewpoints over to the left, compared to the difficulty of having neoliberalism recuperate them. &#x200B; Am I completely disconnected from reality? I've noticed something similar to this happening at an ever increasing rate lately, previously alt-right bigots coming around the other side. See Richard Ojeda, and also that Bundy guy now declaring solidarity with the Central American Refugee Immigrants. Before you write this off as absurd, I encourage you to give it an honest consideration and tell me what you think. ",a7rba7,self.Anarchism,,True

Technologies have reached a point where each person can achieve complete sustainability with minimal investment. The burdens of society inhibit us from pursuing passions to the fullest extent. As long as the people that come are contributors and don't act without my and the tribe's approval, they can have a free place to live.

PV solar, homesteading, personal/community gardens, and ergonomic accommodation for contributors are examples of the things we've been focusing on. Anybody that wants to be a part of this can join, we just have to bring love and show we're all family.

Should I join a political party as an anarchist?,Anarchism,"Hello! The last year I have been reading a lot about anarchism and it really makes sense to me. The problem is that in Sweden anarchism is not a big thing. There is barely a Swedish website on anarchism and people, in general, don´t really know or care about anarchism. So what should I do? I really want to get politically involved, but I don't know how. &#x200B; Should I join a political party? The left has good ideas, but could it be justified to operate inside the system which we as anarchist oppose rigorously? On the other side it is better than not doing anything, and who says that I cant provide social changes by being involved in questions about freedom and less oppressive laws?

Liberal identity politics is utter trash,Anarchism,"The Left used to focus on dismantling hierarchical structures and mass, collective action. Nowadays you have these liberals who make personal identity and the self the entire horizon of their political consciousness-- everything is about what X person said to me, or slights, or call out culture. Am I saying idpol is useless, period? Nope. As a POC myself, I'm all for avoiding harmful language. These kind of things can take their toll on your emotional health over a period time. But when they make up your political vision, you're left with a politics of impotent individualism and division. I can't believe how much energy is devoted to trivial nonsense like Halloween costumes. Before someone says it.. no, I'm not advocating class reductionism. I don't believe the abolition of capitalism will necessarily translate into the eradication of racism, sexism, ableism, etc. But all of these isms are mediated through the dominant mode of production, capitalism, and you can't divorce them as liberals do. Unfortunately, I feel like this liberal idpol has also seeped into some leftist quarters as of late. As a POC and a leftist, I want white comrades to introspect about racism and redouble their commitments to being anti-racist. What I don't want, is this divisive, liberal idpol where trivial bullshit is blown up. All it takes is a simple explanation, and move on. So much of call out culture, of gatekeeping, of finger-wagging about 'problematic behaviors' is just a distraction. I will hold white people accountable, but this divisive climate is not conducive.

Pre-Colonial Australia (ie Aboriginal Australia) is in my opinion the most far reaching and long lasting example of integrated but independent anarcho-communist societies in history and demand far more serious engagement and study.,Anarchism,"This is not “noble savage” bullshit. Aboriginal Australia was truly exceptional in social organisation even compared to other Indigenous societies in my opinion. Let me explain why: 1) In precolonial Australia, there was NEVER a land war. There is no evidence in either the archeological record or oral histories. Wars were governed by incredibly strict socio-spiritual rules of engagement, and served as means of violent and often retributive methods of conflict resolution. This much violence is to be expected in any society in my opinion, but the nature of it was generally non lethal. Non combatants and especially children were NEVER harmed, and harsh retribution followed (from your own side) if you broke those rules. These rules where the same as those extended to regular criminals: all punishment was essentially corporal, relatively minor, mostly ecological or incest (related to skins groups) were punished with broken bones or a generally non Lethal spear. Serious crimes such as rape and murder were punished with ostracism (which means death if found). In my opinion, and especially considering how infrequently these punishments happened, this is considerably more humane than current systems of on one hand large scale imprisoned people, often worked as slaves and tortured, both physically and psychologically, and on the other hand the arbitrary lethal “justice” of the State. 2) These Matrilineal societies (somewhat matriarchal even in most cases) place mothers (not necessarily always those who have given birth, or even can give birth - this is not a gendered role in precolonial Australia) are the primary diplomats. Imagine a society where mothers are in charge of negotiating peace. And not only that, but loving mothers being created by society itself, regardless of individual biology. 3)Contrary to popular racist histories, aboriginal people were never “hunter gatherers”. It is true they were semi nomadic peoples, but this was largely a lifestyle choice. Tribes (read: large extended families) belonging to larger tribes/nations would rotate through essentially permanent settlements, with long term and complex living houses, fire pits, aquaculture systems and industry including textiles, baking, drying fruits and smoke curing meat. These spaces would be virtually always in occupation, but by different tribes/families at different times. This largely served and ecological function, with totemic systems governing which tribes/people could eat what, and allow eaten food to regenerate without disturbance. 4) Massive grain farms and kangaroo cattle farms were extensively cultivated. The landscape was “checkered” in much of the southern, fire scorched part of the country. Spaces for grain production were cleared and maintained with fire, and in between these farm patches (patch being a very relative term - these could be many MANY kilometres long and wide), forest would remain, being essentially sanctuaries and seed baskets for the grain farms, as well as fruit sources in their own right. Extensively cultivated (and domesticated - although these strains have been lost as former agricultural land has turned to Europeanised pastoral land) were a type of starchy perennial yam (growing often as large as big carrots, or with bulbs similar to small potatoes) as well as the native grain kangaroo grass - which was used extensively to make flour, which was stored in vast quantities to make damper (a type of bread) year round. This checkered pattern of agricultural landscaping also protected from extensive fire damage. At the end of perennial crop cycles of kangaroo grass and yam Daisy’s (which once plants, produce for two years) the seeds would be harvested from the dying plants, and stored - then the fields would be burned. Crops would be rotated (either yams or kangaroo grass) to allow nutrients for the other to regenerate. This is essentially indefinitely sustainable agriculture. As a plus, the routine burning of spaces on a checked landscape allowed bushfires to be incredibly localised in hot months. With vast swathes of grassland ash, fires (which were frequent) never spread far, and virtually never threatened people. This cannot be said of Australian bushfires today. 5) Kangaroo grass fields, as the name suggests, served as kangaroo farms of a sort as well. Although never domesticated, there are heavy reports of essential “fences” structures of felled trees funneling kangaroos to a certain spot. When the were flushed to the final fence, only the strongest (basically alpha male) kangaroos could jump over the very high fence, and would be intercepted by hunters on the other side. Hunting Kangaroos like this is also indefinitely sustainable. Female kangaroos are either pregnant or raising a Joey for their entire adult lives - and a few kangaroos will happily impregnate multiple females. By killing the largest kangaroos, this would also allow kangaroo population booms, as the largest are also the most violent to females, and sometimes deadly to Joeys. So grain farms doubled often as cattle farms. 6) Societal organisation was governed by fluid hierarchies of knowledge and mutual respect. “Elders” were not mandated leaders but immensely trusted and knowledgeable members of their community. It is a fundamentally earned status, and once granted was taken extremely seriously on threat of ostracism. Despite the name, elders could be anyone of adult age. I have met Elders in their twenties. Older people are expectedly better represented as Elders for their long term understandings and generally wider knowledge base. Although father/mother relationships strictly reserved knowledge for certain groups of people, this was never done as a matter of hierarchy, but social harmony. Knowledge was understood to belong to and be the responsibility of those of complex spiritual persuasions, and in this way knowledge was non hierarchically and non-deterministcially specialised. People were respected for their highly specific knowledge skills and consulted frequently. Furthermore, as a matter of deep responsibility, sharing was paramount. Foreign travellers would always be looked after and respected. And fire was ALWAYS freely shared, even often with enemies. Property did not exist, and effectively an enormous network of mutual aid did instead. For further reading, I suggest Bruce Pascoes Dark Emu and Bill Gammages the Biggest Estate on Earth. Both provide thorough and historically accurate account of Indigenous social organisation and cultivation of the land. The journals of early colonisers paint an entirely different picture of this rugged country, one that, while still rugged, was marked and cultivated extensively by humans. The colonial reports and even drawings of these vast physical and agricultural constructions paint a completely different Australia to the untamed wildness we are accustomed to. Much of this knowledge has been dismissed or ignored for centuries by White Australia, and it is important to note that upwards of 95% of the Indigenous population had been killed by genocide, disease and dispossession by 1903, and although oral histories have retained much of this knowledge, much has been lost, but much may still be rediscovered. It demands serious study and appreciation. Although I mainly here talk of cultivation techniques specific to the dry, south eastern part of the continent, similar systems of ecological cultivation and social organisation that were regions specific were widespread. Even in deserts. Although it would obviously be unfeasible to create a society EXACTLY like that again, there is a lot of knowledge to be gained from study and respect for aboriginal cultures, and many techniques and ideas that could readily be adapted to the modern world, especially those related to ecology - which was the central ethically governing principle to which all other laws were socially and spiritually related. There are hundreds of domesticate crops and potential bountiful and cultivated ecosystem that can be understood if Indigenous peoples are treated with the respect and the recognition the sovereignty they deserve.",a4qr53,self.Anarchism,,True

These local propagandists can spread their message amongst likeminded comrades through any form of media they choose. They should focus on local issues, always with a critical eye. They should always exploit the failures of capitalism, and discuss major issues in their community.

"If you use a Nazi insult to insult a Nazi, is that considered hate speech?",Anarchism,"*EDIT: To avoid some apparent confusion, this is not behavior I have personally engaged in and am trying to have justified. I heard about someone doing this and getting punished by an online platform and was curious as to the perspective of others on it.* I'm not trying to troll and make some 'gotcha' hypocrisy point. I'm legitimately just curious about the views of those here. Say you're arguing with some alt-right/Neo-Nazi individuals that racism is abhorrent besides being nonsense (so you clearly and publicly disagree with them). Finally, as the argument devolves to ad hominems and insults from the Nazis, you call them N-----s. You know that Nazis attempt to justify the use of that word as a description of a type of behavior and not just a label for all black people. So you throw back in their faces that all the negative connotations of behavior they accuse minorities of, you point out how they're behaving as bad as the worst of their stereotypes by calling them their own viscous insult. Is this hate speech? Does calling a white racist Nazi a racial slur associated with black people qualify as hate speech as we normally think about it? After all, if someone is ok being associated with Nazis, there's little in terms of names that one could likely call them to truly upset them - short of possibly calling them one of the most degrading and dehumanizing insults they lob at others. I can see the argument that any use of the word as an insult continues its power and increased use in society - which is objectively a bad thing. However, there's also a view that if society began utilizing the word more frequently as an insult **at Nazis** than at blacks, it could change the nature of the word and take some of the potency out of it. And beyond the general attitudes toward it, the fundamental question is: **Should someone be punished (for example by online platforms) for hate speech by merely using the word - regardless of context - or should the context be recognized - that it is directed at white Nazis while arguing AGAINST racism and against those Nazis that generally use the slur most harmfully - and thus NOT be punished?** Yes, there's more nuance and history behind the situation with Sargon.

Cultivated identity and the left,Anarchism,"I worry there is a cultivated identity formed around the popular figures of BreadTube- specificially with Contrapoints, Folding ideas, and Lindsay Ellis. What we see in the modern online left can sometimes be indistinguishable from a fandom. I see this to be an important problem, because the most popular content in the community is vague in its stance, (the only stance that is certain is that it is social progressive) thus allowing for complacency. People may feel that their 'politics quota' may be filled up by participating in a cultivated identity in the left, tweeting about m o u t h f e e l, for example, and they may not actually advocate for a new social system, or even have a new social system to advocate. Do not get me wrong, not all content has to have a specific ideology, but when the most popular lefty content is extremely vague, and there is a cultivated identity attached to it, it can divert us from making real change. I first got very worried about this when I saw a post on r/contrapoints that had pictures of the major lefty youtubers and some liberal politicians, and said 'who would rather be stuck on a desert island with?' This is completely identical to a fanbase post, and exibits people who like the non ideological side of left tube not being exposed to actual frameworks for social change and forming parasocial relationships with not only leftubers, but liberal politicians. Through the combination of cultivated identity and leftube on a large part neglecting to talk about any struggle besides social ones (im not a brocialist, i just care about class and state opression as well as other identity opressions), these people resort to thinking these liberal figureheads are the answer, and LIBERAL FIGUREHEADS ARE NOT THE ANSWER.

Recently interested in anarchy but don't see it as realistic. Need someone to convince me.,Anarchism," (Posted on r/Anarchist but it's dead) I have qualms with almost every single part of anarchy but I find it a very lustful philosophy that I may take further. I'll start from left to right and all the others. The problem I have with all anarchy is is that it seems to be unstable and chaotic. Without laws what stops the physically weak to take the strong, the majority to destroy the minority and what stops groups to take the individual. I'll start from left to right. Anarcho-Communism seems to be the most stable however I believe it will take over single individual businesses much like regular communism. Along with that, I believe that the inventor creates the horse and the council creates the camel. Anarcho-Communism is also too dependant on mutual aid and does not account for natural greed. Next is the centrist bland philosophies, (not anarcho-primitivism, I'll get to that later) These philosophies seem to be chaotic to the highest extent where each tribe of people may grow to as large as they may like, and that is how nations begin which restarts the political timeline. The final on the left to right scale is Anarcho-Capitalism which has been shown not to work through monopolies and how to NAP is violated. The one I personally like the most is Anarcho-Primitivism because it seems to be based on the human psyche the most. I believe this would be the best kind of anarchy but seems it would naturally progress into government based on power much like many kinds of anarchy. Any comments questions, whatever.

'but you have to have an answer to capitalism',Anarchism,"What do you say when people say this or something similar? I think we should get rid of capitalism (not just an anarchist point of view of course). My view is that, like with medicine, if you take a medicine that makes your disease worse or doesn't help, you don't continue taking it just because you don't immediately have a better one, you stop taking it while trying to figure out an alternative. Right? But with people who don't get radical politics or don't seem to be able to see past where we are, they always seem to point out that 'you have to have a solution' or 'what do we replace capitalism with'. That question feels wrong to me, but I don't have a better answer. My feeling is that it's malformed; do you even replace it with something? Getting rid of it IS the replacement: getting rid of class, authoritarian oppression, private property laws that underpin the system, markets and finance etc. Am I wrong?",a4ki6g,self.Anarchism,,True

[04/12] The French situation,Anarchism,"I saw many people interested in what's happening in France so as an anarchist I'll try shed some light on it. I'll also try to make more of these posts as the situation evolves if there is a demand. I apologize already for my bad English. I want to talk about it from my point of view, so if you want to be up to date on the movement as a whole you can read this  I am a student in Toulouse, the 4th largest city in the country. I was not tied to the yellow jacket movement until today where I met some in a cloud of tear gas during a joint protest between students and high schoolers against police violence. They proposed to come to our college general assembly while some people were sending rocks to the police, which responded with tear gas, explosive grenades and flash balls. So that's good. The new generation, coming from high schools, is kinda prone to panic but they are brave and learn fast: don't run when there is tear gas, stay together yadi yada. Also it's 5am in France, and if I'm here, not caring much about my tomorrow courses, it's because I can't easily go to my college: the prefecture (the HQ of the police) decided to close all public transports while there are high schoolers doing shit in the streets, and that will apparently last. This is in order to prevent big protests and i had to walk this afternoon. That's new. You're beginning to get the picture. Our ruling class is out of answers and shitting itself while more and more people protest. But why is it like that? Well, something is very interesting. Those yellow jackets, they are smart. They don't want leaders, diplomats whose goal would be to talk with the government. Some opportunists tried but they soon retreated, receiving death threats. So it's lasting. Do you get it? While not realizing it, they are right now fucking anarchists. They don't want politics because for them politics means hierarchies: alienating parties and unions, they don't want leaders because for them representatives are traitors in the making. They organize horizontally between themselves, and they put more pressure on the elites than we could have dreamed of as leftists. The government decided this morning to stop increasing the price of oil during 6 months, but guess what? It's too late, the yellow jackets tasted police's batons and want social justice now. So the fourth act is in motion and will be happening Saturday, with us students and high schoolers. Let's hope the final act will be the revolution. Also don't worry too much about the far right, people are sick of the elites, they don't want to put a king on the throne but more democracy, and the way they are working as protesters is showing this trend.",a38l5o,self.Anarchism,,True

"This year, we are almost out of time. We must start change now.",Anarchism,"We are down to 11 years to save ourselves from the horrible pollution and consumption that will cause ever-increasing amounts of death and misery, and potentially even our own extinction. &#x200B; I am 19. I was born in 1999. If we stay on our current course, more then 70% of the earth's surface will be uninhabitable by humans before the end of my lifetime. &#x200B; If we do nothing, then *this will be the reason I die.* &#x200B; I will not sit by while the rich inch me closer and closer to my death. I will not be fed that horrible indignity by the people who overwork my family, capitalize on my friends' homelessness, and brainwash the masses into reactionary thought that turns them against each other. I will not sit by while my friends justify inaction by saying, 'We're fucked no matter what we do,' or, 'Marching and voting is how we bring real change!' I will not let them be brainwashed by the lies and the false hope, and I will not let their inaction doom both them and myself to extinction. Humanity will not survive if we do not disassemble the exploitation, overconsumption, and destructive power institutions that are pulling us toward our own deaths. &#x200B; I deserve better. My family deserves better. My friends deserve better. &#x200B; We all deserve better. &#x200B; So, this year, here's what I'm going to do. 1. Every single weekend, I'm going to get a meal or coffee with three people, and have a discussion wherein we breakdown each other's worldviews, disassembling all the bad ideas, all the internalized lies, and all the problems that cause complacency or denial toward the things that are killing us. 2. I'm starting a socialist student union on my university's campus. We will have no hierarchy, no leaders, and no regard for the school's authority. We will operate democratically, allowing in all who want to participate, with decisions being made democratically, with a range of causes worthy of pursuit. We will not shy from civil disobedience, and we will take our causes seriously when the school won't. 3. I've just recently joined the IWW, the DSA, and the Marxist Group that operates around my school. I am going to participate vigorously in as many of their activities as possible. Now, as an AnCom, I of course have problems with the DSA and the Marxist Group ideologically, but the common ground is much bigger than the differences, and in a time when we are so few, and must rally so many, unity is something I am willing to work with. 4. I am going to begin working again, since I need money for school, and this coming semester shouldn't be as difficult as last semester. I will work strongly with my fellow employees to make sure we see the rights we deserve, and if they are not unionized, I will push for them to do so. I, with my fellow campus and community socialists, will lay a foundation for the liberation of the workers, the fight against hierarchy, and the salvation of our ecosystems. &#x200B; The rich will not save us. The congresspeople will not save us. &#x200B; We must build, thoroughly, and effectively, and not lose the ideals that serve as the only hope of us saving ourselves. This will take time, but with all of our effort, we can stop the rich at the eleventh hour. The alternative is extinction. We have eleven years.",abcbsb,self.Anarchism,,True

Oof. Having to witness the horrible indoctrination of a couple of kindergartners today almost broke me,Anarchism,"So, one of my part-time gigs is as a party bus driver. This moderately wealthy suburban family hired my bus to drive them for a Christmas lights tour. Besides them all being obviously petit-bourgeois and bootlickers and breast-implanted gold diggers, everything was going fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. Then we got to the actual Christmas lights drive, it's this specific park in a town nearby where they set up a route that you drive and they show off all of their light setups along the way, and they even have you tune your car to a specific FM channel because the lights blink and do various things in accordance with the music playing through your vehicle's speakers. Kind of a neat little thing to be honest. We were coming up to a big-ass American flag made of Christmas lights, and I was already internally rolling my eyes, but then it started getting **seriously Orwellian**. As we got closer to the flags and another Christmas light set that showed 'Support our Troops' in bright letters, the parents pointed out the flag and the signage to a couple of young kids who couldn't have been older than 6 max, and started prodding them to read the words and asking them if they knew the Pledge of Allegiance. Once they sounded out the words, the two youngest ones started chanting it. *Support our troops! Support our troops! Yay!* Then with a little guidance and prompting from a couple of them, including a guy that I think was grandpa, they started to enthusiastically state the Pledge of Allegiance. Then I think it was either mom or an aunt fit in the mention that they should be thankful to God and in a total innocent kindergartener voice the one girl was like 'thanks God!' By this time I'm dying inside, and it continues like this for a good ten minutes until we get out of the park - *but oh wait*, there's the Salvation Army bigot beggar standing at the very end awaiting a donation, so we've got to stop the bus and the parents give the kids some dollars and the kids go running out there and happily put their money in the little red container. Those kids have *no clue* that the Salvation Army will refuse to shelter someone in need because they *appear* to be gender or sexuality atypical. At that point right there I had a very hard time keeping myself silent. It's been a long time since I've been so close to blowing up on somebody. Can you believe the nerve of these people? They don't even recognize their own barely veiled indoctrination of these poor children. And those children are going to grow up with all the wrong ideas and it's going to be *so damn hard* to re-educate them. Fuck. The whole experience just left me feeling so horrible. That, along with all the other holiday season bullshit, along with Trump basically telling Ergodan that he can just 'have' northern Syria - fuck the Kurds, I guess - and all-in-all it's been a pretty goddamn shitty December.

What are some fellow anarchists beliefs towards 'offensive' words?,Anarchism,"I'm just wondering how others feel about this topic. Should we not allow people to use certain words, or at least alienate those that do regardless of their intention? Or should we look at the intention behind the words before judging others for using them? On one hand, we're silencing people which I know a lot of anarchists will disagree with, but on the other, we could potentially be allowing people to be hurt based on who they are. I think there's very compelling sides to each argument and would love to hear them. &#x200B; For example, is it never okay to use the word 'retarded'? And those that use it should stop? Or is it okay if the people using it mean no harm, and it's used between friends in a more-or-less wholesome way? What about words like 'nigger' and 'faggot'? Should we stop using these words all together forever? Or is it okay to use them casually because it strips them of their meaning? It's no secret that many black people have adopted the word 'nigger' so as to no longer hurt them, and people in the LGBTQ+ community have done the same thing with the word 'faggot'. &#x200B; Unfortunately, it's not something we can just ask people of these minority groups because they are obviously very diverse and have different feelings about it as I'm sure that our little anarchist community has as well. Some gay people hate the offensive word, but some have zero problems with it and even use it. &#x200B; Please don't downvote me. I'm genuinely curious how some of us feel about this issue because I just had a lengthy conversation with someone about it discussing both sides. Clearly, both people mean no harm and want the best for everyone ultimately, but there are just different ideas of how to accomplish that. I'm personally torn and would love to hear some more opinions on this. Thanks and happy holidays comrades! o7",a8izvp,self.Anarchism,,True

How do you guys deal with day to day life?,Anarchism,"Comrades, I’m having a hard time lately. Trying to exist in a capitalist society is so pressing. Up until last month I had a “good job” as a web dev. I just couldn’t do it anymore. I was earning an extremely good wage and couldn’t have wanted for anything in terms of my privilege in the capitalist system but it meant absolutely fuck-all. I don’t give a flying fuck about succeeding in a capitalist system. Anyway, I had a mental breakdown due to the futility of it all and literally quit by email while I was 20 meters away from the office because I couldn’t bring myself to go into work. I just couldn’t see the point and stayed in bed for 2 weeks. But now obviously I realise I need a job to exist in this society. Its a fucking catch 22 and it fucks me up. I have student loan debts and rent I need to pay so I can’t just fuck off and not exist within society. It feel so overwhelming sometimes. I trapped in a system that I can’t not live in and I have to exist in it for the rest of my life. I’ve always tried to convert people I work with by subtle anarchist teachings and that kept me sane but lately I’m so tired. Obviously, theres depression underlying this all but I know so much of it is brought on by having to exist in this system.
