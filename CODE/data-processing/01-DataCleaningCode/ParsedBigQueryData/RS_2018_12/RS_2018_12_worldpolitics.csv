"Is One Country's Trash, Another Country's Treasure: What Happened When China Banned the Import of Plastic Waste",worldpolitics,"Since 1950, the word has produced 8.3 billion tons of plastic, and 322 million in 2015 alone. Plastic utensils and other waste is filling up our landfills and choking our oceans. Plastic can only be properly recycled after being sorted and graded, a labor intensive process that most wealthy consumers are unwilling to do. As a result, tens of millions of tons of plastic waste are exported to China where this plastic is recycled and re-purposed. The plastic recycling may have solved environmental problems in wealthy nations, but created new ones in China. The plastic imported that could not be recycled was often dumped into China's streets and rivers, and between 10-15% of China's plastic waste originated in the developed world. Moreover, the acrid fumes and toxic by-products of plastic recycling damage the environment. Wen'an, the city at the center of China's plastic recycling industry, is one of the most polluted in China. To solve these problems, China effectively banned the import of plastic waste in 2017, creating a host of problems for the rest of the world. &#x200B; It is estimated that 111 million tons of plastic worth $ 7 billion need to be redirected to make up for the loss of Chinese markets, and over three quarters of world's plastic waste exports once went to China . Some of this plastic was redirected to other markets, although it is unlikely any set of countries can replace the central role placed by China. Imports of plastic waste to Indonesia have increased by 56%, doubled to Vietnam, and increased 10 fold in Thailand. Malaysia has emerged as the largest importer of plastic, importing an estimated 160 million tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world. However, the same environmental problems of recycling plastic has overwhelmed these countries. Malaysia and Thailand will ban the import of plastic by 2021, and it is likely over time other countries will follow suit. Much of the plastic once sent to China is accumulating in warehouses and recycling centers in wealthy nations, and no one knows what to do with it. &#x200B; The Chinese government banned the import of waste paper in addition to waste plastic. The economics of paper recycling are similar to that of plastic. China once imported $5 billion worth of waste paper, roughly half of the world's total. However, unlike with plastic, India is increasingly replacing China in waste paper imports. Indian imports of waste paper have doubled since 2007, and thanks to China's ban, are expected to more than double in 2018. Much of the labor intensive process of sorting and grading waste paper happens in the slums of Indian cities where wages are low, and environmental standards lower. The most famous slum based recycling center is that of Dharavi, made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, but it is hardly the only such recycling hub in India. After grading and sorting, the paper is sent to paper mills where it is converted into newspapers and packaging. It is expected that by 2025, two thirds of all the paper mill feed-stock will come from recycled sources, much of this imported from abroad. &#x200B; **Selected Sources** ",a6cezx,self.worldpolitics,,True

"No Child Without Vaccination, No Family Without Health Insurance: The Political Economy of Public Health in Rwanda",worldpolitics," In just 100 days, almost one million Tutsis, moderate Hutu and Twa were massacred in one of the most brutal episodes of violence n modern history. Today's podcast episode is about the process of rebuilding from the ravages of the genocide. Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front that took power after 1994 have overseen an economic miracle, and real improvements in the standards of living of the Rwandan people. I will be focusing on the ideological roots of Rwanda's economic miracle, the process of reducing corruption and improving state capacity, and resulting ability of Rwanda to dramatically improve ordinary citizens access to healthcare. The Rwandan genocide left immense social scars in addition to physical damage. The majority of Rwanda's population after the genocide was till overwhelmingly Hutu, the majority of whom willingly or through coercion, participated in the genocide. Both the Belgian colonial government, and the post-independence Hutu led government emphasized the difference between and inequality between a Tutsi elite and the Hutu masses. The RPF was committed, through customary Gacaca courts, to convict those guilty of crimes during the genocide while at the same time propagating an ideology that emphasized the shared language and culture of Hutu and Tutsi. At the same time, the stark reality remained that the majority of the population, whether willingly or unwillingly, participated in the genocide. The current RPF government, dominated by former exiles from Uganda, is unsurprisingly terrified of losing political power. The RPF has concentrated all political power in its hands, and has strived to gain political legitimacy by developing the country. Part of gaining legitimacy to govern is stamping out petty corruption in the bureaucracy. To government regularly takes action such as firing hundreds of ",a4s9t6,self.worldpolitics,,True

Turkey is a key player of Washington on missile defense,worldpolitics," Recently, relations between Ankara and Washington have noticeably deteriorated. This deterioration of relations between the two countries is connected, on the one hand, with the support that Americans have for the Kurds, on the other, with the purchase of the C-400 systems from Russia. Meanwhile, despite a significant deterioration in relations between the United States and Turkey, the States continue to hope that Ankara will not leave NATO. Moreover, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Erdogan should 'maintain deeper relations with the United States and with Europe.' Deeper relations imply the inclusion of Turkey in the general air defense and missile defense system of NATO. This is evidenced by a report submitted to the US Congress. According to Washington, Ankara is a 'key player' in deterring 'barbarian states' and terrorist groups. And, despite the difficult period, the joint activities of Turkey and the United States is successful in some areas. First of all, this is the joint work of the two countries in Syria. In addition, there are two thousand American troops in Turkey, and the Turkish Air Force and radar equipment assist the American forces. Moreover, Turkey plans to fulfill the US requirement to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2024. At the same time, Ankara plays a special role in ensuring the security of NATO’s southeastern flank. According to military analysts, Turkey is a suitable place for both the deployment of anti-missile radar and interceptor missiles. Its convenient geographical position contributes to the deployment of systems that can block the rocket-hazardous directions, the trajectories of which come from the Middle and Near East. But, despite the statement of the Erdogan’s representative about the defensive purposes of the Patriot air defense systems, they can be used for other, far from defensive purposes. Turkish authorities began to consider the option of installing a missile defense system back in 2013. Among the sellers for deliveries were considered China with long-range air defense systems, the United States with the Patriot systems and the SAMP / T air defense system manufactured by the Italian-French concern Eurosam. Negotiations with China ended in November 2015 due to disagreements of the parties on various issues, including technology transfer and co-production. At the same time, the authorities decided to cancel the tender in general. The tensions between Turkey and the United States most likely will not affect Washington’s far-reaching plans to promote a global missile defense system. Meanwhile, the decision of Ankara remains unknown. Thus, the press secretary of the President of Turkey, Ibrahim Kalyn, said that Ankara could agree to the American proposal, if the contract for the Patriot air defense systems will provide for joint production.",a5209a,self.worldpolitics,,True

Modernization of Russian Federation's airborne forces military equipment,worldpolitics," In December 2018, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on the modernization of about 600 airborne combat vehicles. It is planned that the modernization of BMD-2 to the level of BMD-2K-AU and BMD-2M will begin in 2021. BMD-2 - unpretentious in service, highly passable combat vehicle, but given the characteristics of modern weapons, which in recent years has stepped far forward, it became necessary to upgrade these systems. The new BMD will be equipped with an anti-tank missile system, a modern digital reconnaissance, control and communications complex, an integrated automated control system at the tactical level, as well as automatic target tracking for firing various types of weapons during the day and night, on the go and afloat. In addition, the upgraded BMD will remain airborne and will perform tasks as part of the airborne paratroop units. The new version of the combat vehicle will be equipped with a single Bereg military compartment with standardized weapons of the latest modification of the BMD-4 airborne combat vehicle. Due to this, it will be possible to fire not only on manpower, but also on armored vehicles and air targets. The Kornet anti-tank complex mounted on the BMD -2M was also upgraded, which made it possible to fire at battle tanks and other armored vehicles 6 km away. In addition, the shooting of the UM 'Cornet-EM' is carried out on the principle of 'shot-forgotten' in the exceeded mode to reduce the likelihood of detection. The new version of the machines is also equipped with radio stations R-168-25U-2, weapon stabilizers 2E36-6. Thus, the modernized BMD-2M was able to fire all kinds of weapons from the spot, on the move, afloat, day and night using a target tracking machine. Innovations will also affect the commanding machines BMD-2K. This project also assumes installation on existing commander automated unified machines of the new equipment. Such a revision affected only the complex of radio-electronic means and is intended to enhance the capabilities of the commanding BMD in the management of the paratrooper battalion. Thus, a complex of automation equipment and communications of the 3rd type (so-called KSAS-3) will be installed on the base BMD-2K, intended for use by the commander of the parachute battalion. This equipment is part of the automated control system of airborne assault division 'Polet-K'. The remaining characteristics of the machine, including the power plant and weapons, remain the same. This approach to modernization will not only greatly facilitate the simultaneous operation of equipment, but also ensure their joint combat work.",a7a39o,self.worldpolitics,,True

Part 4 : OpenBazaar And Institution - Open Letter no.2,worldpolitics," This is the second open letter to readers of my articles and the first open letter published on November 26. Those who possibly found the first letter disturbing. Those who thought to themselves, outright, it was wrong. Before posting my first letter I paused for a while, I was about to create an image of myself which would last forever. Then I thought I wasn’t creating anything. That’s who I am. Normally it’s not good that exposing who you really are, damages you, but that’s how things are. The aim of my articles was to encourage debates on topics relevant to the whole world. But I understand that the real me is on the way. So I decided to write this letter. In such an interconnected, complex world we live in, no individual, no single idea can save the world. Put aside, individuals. Ideas should be discussed, rejected, developed and transformed. Ideas which have been developed collectively will lead to lasting social reforms. Ignore individuals. Ignore their mistakes, their misjudgments. Let the debate begin. For a long time prison for me was something to be forgotten. It took years to realize the opposite was true. The lesson was in fact far too valuable to be forgotten. Some months ago I noticed that Mr Gauke, UK Secretary for Justice had expressed his intentions for prison reform. As a person who had experienced life on both sides of prison doors, I thought it was time to bring the topic to the foreground. Mr Gauke had mentioned reforming one side of the prison doors. There are, in fact, two sides to each door and both sides of prison doors need reform. And it’s not limited to the UK. Global problems need global solutions. For me, civil disobedience wasn’t an easy choice. I wouldn’t do that if I hadn’t clearly and firmly rejected violent solutions and protests in my previous articles. Then protests in France began. It wasn’t entirely peaceful and it achieved as much as protests in this kind could achieve: A few laws were overturned. And it urged me to write this letter to make it clear that no profound reform is ever achieved by violence. No violent solution exists for global problems our world faces. We need no more destruction. Destruction, of the environment and global stability among other things, are being done on a daily basis. Construction, however, based on global collaboration is the solution. And lastly, I should apologize to those who found my first letter disturbing. I posted that for what I believed to be a good cause, globally. &#x200B; This is the link to other articles : ",a6dwxm,self.worldpolitics,,True

'excavated' reason behind politics,worldpolitics,"this is a philosophical or reasonable rant that gets to the core purpose of politics, which seems to have become economically motivated and not political: all we, people, want to do is socialize and have good experiences. we show off to each other to get revenge for not socializing and not having considerably good experiences and then we get to the point where we say things like 'survival of the fittest' in a way that is not about biological adaptation. people with money sway the world and everyone has to make a living somehow because life is not free. it takes money to make money, products are captivating because of the conveyed hopes in advertisements, which costs money and things seem more and more like they are made to break, which costs money to repair or replace. wars are a kill and grab. people admire each other for them or for their stuff. why can't we just have public projects for public benefit and interact with each other? our species is a tragedy. governments should ask their people what they want to do with their days and honor the democracy of opinions with public projects for public benefit as to manage people with ease by keeping them happy.",a5yy34,self.worldpolitics,,True

Nationalism vs Internationalism - Who's Going to Win?,worldpolitics,"Brace for a long post, the context is important. This doesn't have to do with any political event in particular, just about the competition between these two ideologies that we see appearing all over the world now. I'm curious to see what everyone thinks about it. &#x200B; From the end of WWII up until the end of the Cold War, everyone seemed to largely be on board with internationalism, since we had the Soviet menace always looming in our minds and the memories of WWII were still fresh. The thinking was that more closely integrated societies, polities, and economies could help prevent the future outbreak of war and other types of strife within the western bloc and even in the developing world, and that the western alliance would deter war with outside competing powers. Admittedly, there is certainly some merit to this thinking, and a lot of good came out of it. One could argue that WWI and WWII happened partially as a result of a congregation of several large competing powers on the Continent who were rarely cooperative and amicable with each other. There was no outside hegemon binding them together and actively engaging with them, like America does today. But since the fall of the USSR and the brief period of liberal triumphalism in the 1990's, and after the disaster of Iraq in 2003 and America's subsequent failures in the Arab Spring, and the current migration crisis in Europe, it seems obvious that the west has begun to experience a lot of doubt about America's leadership role and internationalism in general. &#x200B; Internationalism, as I understand and am using the term, means bringing nations together to pursue common political, economic, and security interests, often under a supranational organization such as the WTO or NATO, but not necessarily a 'one world government.' According to David Rockefeller himself, internationalism means working to '**build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will**.' Now of course, the conspiracy theorists \*really\* latch onto that quote, but I'm not really going to entertain various Bilderberg, Milner Group, CFR, and Trilateral Commission conspiracy theories other than acknowledging that yes, global political and business leaders meet at these places and within these groups to discuss current issues and make plans, that they're all interested in protecting and furthering their own interests, and that many of them do want more closely integrated global governance through institutions like the UN, the WTO, the EU, etc. They're much more bureaucratic- and managerial-minded people than the average joe, so I expect nothing less from them. It's also worth noting that Rockefeller later clarified his meaning, saying, ' **I don't recall that I have said — and I don't think that I really feel — that we need a world government. We need governments of the world that work together and collaborate. But, I can't imagine that there would be any likelihood — or even that it would be desirable — to have a single government elected by the people of the world.'** &#x200B; The E.U., the UN Migration Pact, the Paris Accords, and the TPP are all relatively modern internationalist projects that were the brainchildren of Rockefeller-type international capitalists and statesmen. They have all come under vicious scrutiny and suspicion, and I'd argue for good reason. None of them seem to be of major benefit to the average person when you actually get down to the nitty-gritty details, and what benefits there are are outweighed by the costs, which may include their economic prosperity, their national sovereignty, the survival of their culture, etc. Constant military intervention and attempts at nation-building, however necessary in some places and foolhardy in others, has become unpopular with the public, especially when we can't seem to achieve a meaningful and lasting victory. Semi-constant flare-ups of tensions with Russia, our old Cold War adversary, also confuse and frustrate much of the public, who can't seem to find a reason as to why we need to be concerned with an old adversary who is a shadow of their former selves and is no longer threatening to spread a diametrically opposed ideology, and have a hard time getting motivated to protect abstract concepts like a 'rules-based international order' (even though there is a good academic argument for doing so). They don't see why guaranteeing the military protection of Luxembourg should be important to them. &#x200B; Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, protests worldwide against the WTO and the TPP, Yellow Vest protests in France, Merkel refusing to seek reelection, these all seem to be signs of a hard rejection of internationalism/globalism. National sovereignty is becoming re-enshrined once again. I personally see this as a great thing in some respects, but potentially negative in others. Citizens deserve some measure of control over their lives, as much as possible. They shouldn't be governed by unaccountable and unelected bureaucrats from a foreign nation. But at the same time, there are benefits to internationalism/globalization that we should not ignore. It just seems that most of the internationalist policy that we've seen come about over the last 20-30 years has been pretty crappy policy. &#x200B; I'm honestly curious, what's the rationalization behind some of these ideas for internationalists/globalists? Why do they think they're so grand? And don't tell me 'it's all about the international banking cartel and their schemes,' that's both far too simplistic and conspiratorial to be an adequately accurate explanation. Humans are almost never solely motivated by material calculations, there's almost always an emotional, intellectual, or ideological angle to it as well. &#x200B; Do you think we'll witness a full rejection of internationalism and return to a state of quasi-19th century international politics? Or will this all prove to be just a bump in the road to finally bringing about the 'empire of liberty' spoken of by numerous American founders and statesmen? &#x200B; Do you think the west will be able to find a balance between broad international engagement and cooperation while maintaining national sovereignty and interests? Trump seems to be attempting to do so, with his 'principled realism' approach, but it seems to lack clarity and coherency as of right now, as opposed to a slightly more established worldview like conservative internationalism (think of Truman, Reagan, James K. Polk). &#x200B; I certainly hope we find that balance, and soon. ",a8id0d,self.worldpolitics,,True

US-Japan Military Alliance,worldpolitics," After the Second World War, the US ruling circles reacted extremely sharply to the change in the so-called balance of power in Southeast Asia. It was argued in Washington,that after the defeat of Japan, the USSR became the most powerful state in this part of the globe. In this regard, the United States desperately needed an ally in the region, which would be strong enough to provide some local support in protecting against the communication of this area. Washington decided to conclude a peace treaty with Japan on condition that the US military presence was maintained in the country. The signing of this treaty was necessary for the Americans also because anti-American sentiments grew in large sections of the Japanese people, and protests against the occupation regime intensified. Moreover, it is worth noting that the Japanese government, secretly from the people, appealed to the Americans to leave their troops in Japan after the conclusion of a peace treaty. Thus, a security guarantee agreement was signed and signed between Japan and the United States in 1951, which gave the United States the right to build military bases and deploy an unlimited number of armed forces in Japan. The purpose of the treaty was to ensure the security of Japan from the armed attacks of other countries, and the suppression of major internal riots. Japan's right to wage war is not recognized. The Self-Defense Forces was formed in the country, which included land, sea and air components. Washington was engaged in training and arming the Japanese Armed Forces, which were viewed primarily as a counterweight to the Soviet military power in the Far East. In 1979, the number of Self-Defense Forces reached 270 thousand people and subsequently remained approximately at this level. Today, the Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, passed a law on so-called collective defense, which allows the Japanese armed forces to participate with the US Army in any hot spots in the world. At the same time, under the pretext of the alleged 'threat' from neighboring countries for Japan, the task was assined to fully strengthen military cooperation with the United States on the basis of a 'security treaty.' It is worth noting that to date, the ground forces of Japan are armed with 700 tanks, 2.8 thousand units of wheeled armored vehicles, 202 self-propelled artillery installations, 99 volley fire systems and 500 towed guns. The Japanese Navy has 131 combat ships: 4 aircraft carriers, 43 rocket ships, 27 minesweepers, 6 corvettes, 6 coast guard ships, 17 submarines, etc. About 100 Tura-88 anti-ship complexes provide coastal defense. Over 350 anti-aircraft missile systems protect Japan’s airspace. The country has a powerful aviation: Self-defense forces comprise 288 fighters, 287 bombers and 119 attack helicopters. In 2018, Marines appeared in Japan. The creation of the Japanese Marine Corps units means that the Japan Self-Defense Forces finally change their status: the Marine Corps is a strike force, it is not designed to protect its territory, which was previously the main task of the Self-Defense Forces. Consequently, the Japanese army is turning into one of the foremost armies of the world. All this is being done with the support of the United States, who are interested in strengthening the military potential of Japan, and now have a well-armed ally in the Asia-Pacific Region. Thus, almost 70 years after the signing of the treaty, Japan became a full ally of the United States, having a well-armed army. The parties actually recognized the fact that their cooperation went beyond the framework of the Security Treaty, proposing to consider this treaty as the “core basis” of the renewed Security Union.",a5qnq5,self.worldpolitics,,True

Modern weapons for the Arctic,worldpolitics," Due to the fact that currently NATO countries led by the United States are strengthening their positions in the Arctic, Russia has taken a number of measures to ensure the protection of its own interests in the region. In particular, the military presence is increasing, military exercises are being held, the serious development of the Northern Sea Route as the most important logistic artery in the region begins, and, of course, the naval component is being strengthened. The domestic military-industrial complex has innovative solutions that allow military equipment and infrastructure to function smoothly in the harsh conditions of the north. And prospective military equipment and weapons are constantly being tested in the extreme conditions of the Arctic. In 2014, the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation formed the joint strategic command 'North' with headquarters in Severomorsk. As part of the joint strategic command of the Northern Fleet, an army of air force and air defense was formed, as well as an army corps and an arctic motorized rifle brigade prepared to perform combat missions in harsh climatic conditions. The Northern Fleet includes: 41 submarines and 38 ships, including the heavy aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as 8 submarines with ballistic missiles. In 2018, the icebreaker Ilya Muromets, the logistics support vessel Elbrus, and the large landing ship Ivan Gren were added to the Arctic forces. The structure of the Northern Fleet in 2018 included the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which was the first ship with cruise missiles Caliber. This frigate is designed to conduct combat operations in the near and far sea and ocean zones. The basis of its striking power is a universal ship shooting complex, which allows strikes against ground targets with long-range cruise missiles. In the coming years, the Northern Fleet will be replenished with three nuclear missile carriers, Prince Vladimir, Prince Oleg and Prince Pozharsky, and three nuclear-powered project 885 Yasen, Kazan, Arkhangelsk and Ulyanovsk, as well as two frigates of Project 22350 - 'Admiral Kasatonov' and 'Admiral Golovko'. In 2018, 15 aircrafts and helicopters, 62 radar and anti-aircraft missile systems arrived in the Arctic. The coastal missile systems 'Ball' and 'Bastion' appeared in service - to control territorial waters and torrential zones, protect naval bases, coastal facilities and infrastructure of the coast. The air defense of the Russian Federation in the region is getting stronger. In 2018, a new air defense division was formed, units of which were deployed on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, in the villages of Dikson and Tiksi. Here deployed radar, providing control of the air situation. Arctic air defense units receive the S-400 Triumph air defense missile system and the upgraded Pantsir-S1. The complete rearmament of the coastal troops of the Russian Navy is planned to be completed by 2021. Today the share of modern weapons in military units of the Arctic region is about 60%. Thus, Russia seeks to implement all the planned measures for the return of the army to the Arctic region, since this will allow it to provide its northern frontiers with reliable protection from land, air and water.",a38cz2,self.worldpolitics,,True

"Games of Thrones, Sri Lanka Edition?",worldpolitics," On October 26th, the President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, dismissed then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe from office and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mahinda Rajapaksa had served as President of Sri Lanka from 2005 to 2015. He was a controversial leader in part for the brutal tactics used by the Sri Lankan army used to end the rebellion of the Tamil Tigers, and the massive amount of debt incurred by the Sri Lankan government in a series of massive development projects. Mahinda Rajapaksa, at least before the crisis, was the most popular politician in the country especially among the rural Buddhist ethnically Sinhalese masses. However the move is extremely controversial because the Sri Lankan constitution does not grant the president to dismiss the prime minister at will, throwing the country into a political crisis. Just yesterday, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruled that Rajapaksa cannot serve as Prime Minister, but it is unclear how Rajapaksa will react to this blow. The political crisis has impacted the Sri Lankan economy as well. It is unclear who has authority in the Sri Lankan government. Current parliamentary allocations will run out in 2019, and without a legitimate government it is unclear how doctors, teacher and policemen will get paid. A major plank of Sri Lanka's economic policy has been to build massive infrastructure projects with international, especially Chinese funding. The government owes close to $13 billion, with most of the loans have rapid repayment schedules, and the government will have to make a billion dollars in payments in January of 2019. The country could default on its debt if parliament does not allocated money to finance its debt. So far the Sri Lankan rupee and financial markets have been resilient to political uncertainty, but it is unclear how long this can last. The recent domestic political crisis needs to be understood in an international context. Sri Lanka has a strategic location along some of the busiest shipping lines in the world and has emerged as a pawn in geopolitical conflict between India and China. China has been highly supportive of Mahinda Rajapaksa who is seen a pro-Chinese. Maithripala Sirisena has accused Indian intelligence agents of plotting his assassination. While those claims strike me as outlandish, India has long seen Sri Lanka as part of its backyard, and sought through influence Sri Lankan politics through both overt and covert means. Sri Lanka has not been able to leverage its geopolitical significance into increased development, and is instead rivalries are only amplifying divides within the country.

Natural Resources and the Persian Gulf,worldpolitics,"Last week, we introduced the way in which natural resources may be distributed, and the fact that there are other elements for consideration (for example, exploration and exploitation). How can this work here? In the case of the Persian Gulf, the many parties (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates) could be co-owners of the natural resources located in the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone. Undoubtedly, there are several differences amongst Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. Therein, some of these differences show how the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY could work. The first difference is given by the fact the inhabitants possess the total of natural resources at stake (100%). By applying the egalitarian shared sovereignty, each party receives the rights to the same ideal portion (an equal percentage of the ownership of natural resources, minus original ownership of the inhabitants of the islands in question). It would be either over simplistic or naïve to imagine Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates be able to explore and exploit to the same level their shares of natural resources (second difference). However, each of them individually have some elements that put them in a better position in relation to the rest, for example local work force, geographical proximity (third difference). With all these differences in mind, the party most developed technically and economically could explore and exploit natural resources (as they are in the best position to do it), and both the inhabitants adjacent to areas rich in natural resources could offer the work force for the joint venture and grant privileges in terms of location to companies that take the exploration and exploitation. Thus, less advantaged parties in terms of means for exploration and exploitation could also offer the most advantaged party certain exclusive rights in the sea-zone that overlaps with their jurisdictions. Continuous assistance from, for example, Saudi Arabia or Iran, to other parties might become a permanent feature (it may lead to domination or an unbalanced relationship). To avoid this, in the example, Saudi Arabia or Iran, respectively, would have to help the others in developing their means of exploration and exploitation to relatively the same level they have. At the beginning of the agreement Saudi Arabia or Iran would be contributing more towards the exploration and exploitation and hence have a larger return. However, these uneven distributions of burdens and benefits amongst the parties would only be in the short term. Natural resources and all that they imply in terms of rights and obligations are part of a wider agreement that has a target: the Persian Gulf. Finally, the way in which each party redistributes the benefits of this shared model within each population is entirely a matter of national or local distribution and hence may have various forms. That is to say, the egalitarian shared sovereignty gives the basic structure of the solution; the details are subject to actual rather than hypothetical negotiation. As an example, the resultant revenues of some or all the joint activities could be destined to a distribution fund benefiting all the inhabitants. NOTE: based on Chapter 7, Núñez, Jorge Emilio. 2017.

Fight for the Arctic,worldpolitics," Nowadays, there is a growing awareness that in the foreseeable future, the Arctic will become the main resource base of humanity. According to the latest geological survey data, the northernmost corner of the Earth is rich in everything that any country can dream of: oil, gas, precious and non-ferrous metals. In our eyes, the struggle for control over these natural resources is unfolding in the Arctic Ocean. After the abolition of the sectoral principle of dividing the Arctic territory, each state clearly defined its sea borders in the North - 12 miles. Another 200 miles each country was 'presented' as an 'exclusive economic zone.' That is, a given state can develop natural resources within the boundaries of this area and earn them. Everything else has become a 'common use area'. However, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, still laid relief for the Arctic countries - they can expand the boundaries of their marine areas, if they prove that the Arctic Ocean shelf is an extension of the continental platform on which these countries are located. From this point on, all applicants for this territory began to study the seabed. The northern states began to look for signs of kinship of their continent with the strata of rocks in the Arctic Ocean. Russia, on the basis of international law, claims a seabed area outside the 200-mile zone in the entire Russian polar sector with the inclusion of the North Pole zone and the southern extremity of the Gakkel Ridge. This is the area of the extended continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean, which is 1.2 million km2. In December 2001, Russia, the first of the Arctic countries, submitted to the UN Commission the first application for expanding its Arctic shelf. The rationale cited data indicating that the Mendeleev and Lomonosov ridges, located on the deep ocean, are a continuation of the Siberian continental platform. In 2002, the commission concluded that the information provided was not enough to classify the areas indicated in the application as the Russian continental shelf. In this regard, extensive data refinement work has been carried out. Altogether, seven expeditions were carried out on the scientific ship Akademik Fedorov, as a result of which sea bottom measurements and seismic surveys were carried out, bottom sediment samples were collected from a depth of several kilometers. In particular, in August 2007, a unique scientific experiment was conducted in the North Pole area. For the first time in the history of scientific exploration of the Arctic, Russian oceanologists and polar explorers with the help of deep-sea apparatuses 'Mir' have sunk to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean to a depth of over four thousand meters. Scientists took samples of soil and water, took photographs and filming, and also installed a Russian titanium alloy tricolor on the ocean floor. Having studied the basalts and dolerites extracted from the bottom of the northern and southern parts of the underwater range, the scientists found that they have the same nature as the ancient base of the Novosibirsk Islands, which is an integral part of the continental shelf. The last expedition was completed in the framework of the preparation of the second application in October 2014. For the first time, scientific work was carried out in the area of ​​the Podvodnikov and Amundsen basins - beyond 200 miles. Thus, according to scientists, the Russian application for expanding the boundaries of the continental shelf in the Arctic is based on reliable and unique data. As a result, the repeated Russian application for expanding its borders at the expense of the continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean was submitted to the UN in 2015. The Lomonosov Ridge, the Podvodnikov Basin, the Mendeleev Rift, the Chukotka Hollow, which are a continuation of the Siberian continental platform, are mentioned here. The main argument of Russia: a significant part of the underwater territory claimed by the country is a continuation of the continent, constituting a whole with it, there are no faults filled with oceanic crust. Consequently, this is part of the continent, which for some reason plunged into the water, which means that the Lomonosov Ridge and the Mendeleev Ridge can be considered the territory of the Russian continental shelf. To date, the Russian application is still under consideration by the UN Commission. However, Russia has every chance that this application will be accepted. At the same time, Norway, the United States, Canada and Denmark also claim to different parts of the Arctic Ocean, including the extended Lomonosov Ridge. At the moment, only Denmark has submitted its application for expanding the borders of the continental shelf of the Arctic, in addition to Russia. Thus, the main struggle for the shelf and the Arctic as a whole is still ahead. The Arctic race is just beginning, and the main prize is billions of barrels of oil and gas.",a7uoja,self.worldpolitics,,True

Washington protectorate in Japan,worldpolitics," Today, Japan is a post-war vassal, in some ways an unofficial colony of the United States, occupied, deprived of an army and with a constitution of external administration. All the talk about the allied relations of Washington and Tokyo, or the independence of the Land of the Rising Sun are mere speculation. Facts suggest otherwise. For 73 years now, the Americans can literally dispose of the territory of Japan at their own discretion, having their military bases and missile defense systems on it. How did it happen that a country that is the second most powerful economic in the world after the United States turned into an American protectorate? Despite the fact that Japan has a constitutional monarchy, the power of the emperor in the country is substantially limited. Undoubtedly, he can dissolve the lower house of parliament, appoint the supreme judge, confirm the appointment of ministers and the prime minister. The emperor rules for a long time and creates the illusion of stability. In contrast, the Prime Minister changes quite often, about once a year. The exception, perhaps, is the current Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe, who has been in office since 2012. Such a political system was competently created by the United States. On November 3, 1946, under pressure from the occupation authorities, the Japanese government adopted a new democratic constitution of Japan, which was written in the headquarters of General MacArthur, commander of the US occupation forces in Japan. The Japanese Constitution is designed to ensure the external stability of the country with frequent changes of government and full control by the United States. In fact, the emperor plays the role of a screen, behind which successive prime ministers can create political incidents with the hands of Washington. So that the situation does not fundamentally change, and no one could overcome this dependence on Washington, there are many internal factions in Japan that create confusion within each party. The newly elected prime minister lacks the support, time and authority to somehow change the situation. The desire to get out of under too strong US custody, perhaps, has always been present in Japan. But at the moment this does not happen for many reasons. Among such reasons, for example, is the deeply rooted pro-American lobby. Many Japanese politicians simply do not see an alternative to an alliance with the United States, largely due to the influence of Washington, which cultivates the negative image of possible allied countries: Russia and China. Judging by opinion polls, Russia's perception in Japanese society is rather negative than positive. So, Russia is sympathetic to no more than 17% of the Japanese and 80% are negative. At the same time, the attitude to the United States is just the opposite - almost 85% sympathize with the former adversary and only 13.5% experience antipathy (and this despite the countless crimes of American soldiers stationed at bases in Japan). China is considered the main security threat to Japan. Japan is very concerned about the build-up of Chinese military power, the aggressive and offensive policy of the PRC on the seas and oceans. In this regard, it is not surprising that Japan, together with Washington, is preparing a new strategic plan with the participation of the military forces of both countries (Guideline), directed against Chinese military activity in the East China Sea. And despite the fact that the United States indicated that they do not take any position on the issue of sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands (a zone of territorial dispute between the PRC and Japan), the administration of US President Donald Trump said that the United States is obliged to protect Japan under the security agreement. Thus, Tokyo’s shy attempts to acquire some kind of independence were not crowned with success. The current Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, who has been in office since 2012, tried to restore Japan to its former glory. He created the Ministry of Defense, was going to carry out constitutional reform by 2020. In the 9th article of the main document, enshrining the refusal of Japan from the war and the creation of armed forces, the prime minister was going to make a provision on the Self-Defense Forces. Also, Shinzo Abe promised to solve the Kuril issue. But all these projects are under consideration. Japan is still a country under the control of Washington.",a5qjnt,self.worldpolitics,,True

Economic cooperation of Russia and Japan,worldpolitics," Under the leadership of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, economic cooperation between the two countries is developing rapidly. The main areas of Japanese investment in Russia are: the fuel and energy complex, the mining of minerals, the production of automobiles and spare parts, and agriculture. Currently, there are about 270 companies with the participation of Japanese capital in Russia. According to the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan Hiroshige Sako, Japan intends to further develop economic relations with Russia, with special attention being paid to the Russian Far East. In this regard, the Japanese government asks Russian entrepreneurs to talk more about the possibilities of the Far Eastern region. As examples of joint Russian-Japanese projects, Hiroshige Sako cited the opening of a Japanese rehabilitation center in Vladivostok, which has already enabled 2,400 Russian patients to use rehabilitation services based on the knowledge and experience of Japan, industrial production of motor vehicles and engines Mazda in TOR 'Nadezhdinskaya' near Vladivostok. It should be noted that in March this year, a special Russian-Japanese platform was created to support Japanese investment in the Far East. Its founders were the Bank of Japan for International Cooperation, the Agency for the Far East in attracting investment and supporting exports and the Development Fund for the Far East. A number of projects with the participation of Japanese investors uses the support of the Territory of Advanced Development (TAD) and the Free Port Vladivostok regimes. The second phase of the agricultural complex has already been implemented in the Khabarovsk Territory with the support of Japanese entrepreneurs. The area of greenhouses has grown to 5 hectares. The Russian-Japanese agricultural company intends to increase its greenhouses to 10.3 hectares. Up to 6 thousand tons of vegetables and greens per year can be removed from such an area. Last year, 250 thousand tons of tomatoes and 400 tons of various cucumbers were supplied from the greenhouses of the Russian-Japanese enterprise. However, the strategic sphere of Russian-Japanese economic cooperation is the fuel and energy complex. The focus is on Sakhalin oil and gas projects implemented under production sharing production. For example, the first in Russia and one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas production plants began operations in 2009 within the framework of the Sakhalin-2 project. The plant produces 11 million tons of liquefied gas per year, Japan buys 80% of this volume. Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Isuzu, Mazda have their plants in Russia. Since 2010, a plant has been operating in the Yaroslavl region to produce excavators and forklifts of the Japanese corporation Komatsu. The total investment in this project was $ 63 million. It is known that it will begin to produce Japanese drugs for blood cancer in the Yaroslavl region, and Russian-Japanese plant of the production of railways control systems will be launched in the Moscow region in the near future. Thus, despite the introduction of various sanctions against Russia, despite the territorial claims put forward by the official Tokyo to Russia, Russian and Japanese companies continue to cooperate, and this cooperation is growing and developing.",a51z1i,self.worldpolitics,,True

Japan's unrealizable dreams,worldpolitics," Following the meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in November 2018 in Singapore, Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe expressed hope that the two countries would solve the territorial issue and sign a peace treaty without leaving this problem to the next generations. The 1956 declaration will be the basis of the peace treaty. According to Article 9 of this document, the Soviet government agreed to transfer the island of Shikotan and a number of small uninhabited islands of the Lesser Kuril Ridge (Habomai) to Japan, with the condition that their actual transfer under the control of Japan would be made after the conclusion of a peace treaty. The declaration was ratified by both states on December 8, 1956. However, the implementation of this article did not take place due to the fact that in response to the conclusion of the Japanese-American Security Treaty in 1960, the USSR annulled the obligations on the transfer of the islands. The document of the Soviet government dated January 27, 1960 states that these islands will be transferred to Japan only if all foreign troops are withdrawn from its territory. As you know, nothing has changed since then - the American bases remained on Japanese land. As for the Kuril Islands, they are part of the constitutional border of Russia, which serves not only as a border demarcation line with Japan, but also constitutes a natural front line of protection of the entire Far Eastern coast of the Russian Federation, allowing control the entire water area from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific Ocean. In addition, these islands are powerful Russian military and naval bases in the Pacific. By the end of 2017, the armed forces of Russia completed the modernization of military facilities in Kunashir and Iturup, and by the end of 2018 it is planned to create modern military bases on Matua in the central part of the Kuril Islands, and in the north - on Paramushir Island. New Russian bases in the Kuril Islands are equipped with the latest types of weapons, which are designed not only to protect the island territories, but also capable of controlling the entire nearby Pacific territory. The Russian president, who is also the commander-in-chief of the Russian armed forces, is fully considering the significance of this territory for Russia, and there will be no concessions to the Japanese side. At the same time, President Putin seriously explains to both the Japanese leaders and the people of his country the seriousness of the situation in the Far East and the inadmissibility of transferring the Russian territory to Japan. Japan remains an ally of the United States. Consequently, it can be assumed that as soon as Russia transfers the islands to the jurisdiction of Japan, new frontiers of advanced deployment of the combined Japanese-American military group will be created on them. according to analysts, Russia now has no need to discuss the fate of the Kuril Islands. As is well known, without a 'peace treaty', Russia and Japan have diplomatic relations, economic and cultural ties are developing.",a2zx99,self.worldpolitics,,True

The difficulties of signing the Russian-Japanese peace treaty,worldpolitics," Chances are still low for Russia and Japan to overcome differences and concerns related to the pending peace treaty and the decades-long territorial disputes as the leaders are expected to hold another round of talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, experts told Sputnik. On November 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met in Singapore and agreed to advance negotiations on a peace treaty based on the 1956 Soviet-Japanese joint declaration, the only document recognized by both countries. Same day, Putin said that his next meeting with the Japanese prime minister would take place at the G20 summit that will be held on November 30 — December 1. On Wednesday, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary confirmed that Abe would meet with Putin in Argentina. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, the two leaders will discuss the establishment of а mechanism for negotiations on the Kuril Islands. The fact that Japan and Russia have never signed a permanent peace treaty after the end of World War II has long been a stumbling block in bilateral relations. The main issue standing in the way of a treaty is an agreement concerning a group of four islands that both countries claim — Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai, collectively referred to as the Southern Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan. On October 19, 1956, Soviet Union and Japan signed the Joint Declaration on ending the state of war and the restoration of diplomatic and consular relations. The Soviet leadership decided to note in the document that in meeting the wishes of Japan and taking into account the interests of the Japanese state, Moscow agrees to transfer the islands of Habomai and Shikotan to Japan, however, the transfer itself was meant to be made after the conclusion of a peace treaty between the parties. After the conclusion of the Japanese-US security treaty in 1960, which still remains in force and stipulates Washington’s right to place its military bases on Japanese soil, the Soviet Union annulled the commitments made in the 1956 declaration. Since then talks have been stalling due to the unwillingness of the both sides to compromise — neither on the sovereignty of the disputed islands, nor on the timeline of a possible transfer of the two disputed islets, Habomai and Shikotan. Most lately, during the Eastern Economic Forum in September, Putin proposed to sign a peace treaty without preconditions by the end of 2018, but the Japanese side responded that it would maintain its position that the peace treaty with Russia could be concluded only after the settlement of the Kuril islands dispute. Abe’s latest announcement about stepping up negotiations with Russia based on the 1956 declaration, under which the transfer of the two islands should take place after signing a peace treaty, might be perceived as his readiness to compromise, Associate Professor and Academic Program Coordinator for International Affairs at the Temple University Japan Campus James D.J. Brown told Sputnik. 'Abe's agreement in Singapore to accelerate peace treaty talks on the basis of the 1956 Joint Declaration does indicate a new willing to compromise. This is because the 1956 Joint Declaration makes no mention of the larger two islands of Iturup and Kunashir (Etorofu and Kunashiri in Japanese). It is also notable that Abe has stopped making public demands for the return of four islands. He therefore seems to have given up all hope of all four islands ever being returned to Japanese sovereignty,' Brown said. According to the expert, Abe might be now pursuing the so-called 'two plus alpha' option. 'This means that Abe is seeking the transfer of Shikotan and Habomai to Japanese sovereignty after the signature of a peace treaty. In addition, while Iturup and Kunashir would remain under Russian sovereignty, Japan is seeking agreement on a special system of visa-free access and joint economic projects on these two islands (this is the 'alpha'),' Brown said. Valery Kistanov, the head of the Center for Japanese Studies at the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, argued in his comments to Sputnik that Tokyo’s overall position on the issue had not changed. ''I believe that the Japanese position has not changed fundamentally … Having confirmed the validity of the 1956 declaration in Singapore, Shinzo Abe has taken a more flexible position saying that Japan agreed to receive these two islands, sign a peace treaty and then continue negotiations on the territorial sovereignty of the remaining two islands — Kunashir and Iturup. In other words, they have not abandoned their ultimate goals and hopes to receive all four islands, including the two biggest ones', Kistanov explained. According to the expert, Russia would not make any further concessions as well. 'We will not agree with this, as we believe that the issue should be settled on the basis of this declaration, we want to make it a closure signing a peace treaty and transferring the two islands', he said.",a7a3yd,self.worldpolitics,,True

Worth of the U.S. Senate with Proportional Representation and the 'Wyoming Rule',worldpolitics,Is the Senate worth keeping if House elections switch to proportional representation and if House seats are reapportioned using the 'Wyoming Rule'? Disclaimers: Proportional representation is where citizens vote for a political party instead of a candidate. However much of the percentage of votes that each party wins would be the number of seats allotted to that party. The 'Wyoming Rule' refers to a theorized process of reapportionment where the number of House seats for each state depends on the ratio of House seats in the least populous state (i.e. Wyoming).,a6bepi,self.worldpolitics,,True

"Everyone Should Read this. Slowly, and Patiently.",worldpolitics,"From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation. A Grand Jury had been empanelled. Governments from around the world had donated to the “Charity”. Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” to the Clinton Foundation were declared. Hmmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out. Guess who took over this investigation in 2002? Bet you can’t guess. Non other than James Comey. Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it? Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS? Your friend and mine, Lois “Be on The Look Out” (BOLO) Lerner. Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it? It gets better, well not really, but this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right? Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005? No other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein. Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it? Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this time frame? I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, Robert Mueller. What do all four casting characters have in common? They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation. Now that’s just a coincidence, right? Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance. Let’s fast forward to 2009. James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin. Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way. The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hillary. Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians. Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it. However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Bill Clinton goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours. Ok, no big deal right? Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme. Guess who was the FBI Director during this time frame? Yep, Robert Mueller. He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009. Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland. No other than, Rod Rosenstein. Guess what happened to the informant? The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it. How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise? Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved? ~145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal. Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division? No other than, Lois Lerner. Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right? Let’s fast forward to 2015. Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hillary ran the State Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server. He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law. He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email. Sparing you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for Hillary. Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013? Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer (Lockheed Martin) with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer. No other than James Comey. Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh? Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her. Nope couldn’t find any crimes there. Can you guess what happened next? In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy. They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury. Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hillary from any wrongdoing. Can you see the pattern? It goes on and on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues. FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it. All the same players. All compromised and conflicted. All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves. All connected in one way or another to the Clinton's. They are like battery acid, they corrode and corrupt everything they touch. How many lives have these two destroyed? As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Let us not forget that Comey's brother works for DLA Piper, the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation's taxes. And, See the person that is the common denominator to all the crimes above and still doing her evil escape legal maneuvers at the top of the 3 Letter USA Agencies. WHO IS LISA BARSOOMIAN? Let’s learn a little about Mrs. Lisa H. Barsoomian’s background. Lisa H. Barsoomian, a US Attorney that graduated from Georgetown Law, is a protege of James Comey and Robert Mueller. Barsoomian, with her boss R. Craig Lawrence, represented Bill Clinton in 1998. Lawrence also represented: Robert Mueller three times; James Comey five times; Barack Obama 45 times; Kathleen Sebelius 56 times; Bill Clinton 40 times; and Hillary Clinton 17 times. Between 1998 and 2017, Barsoomian herself represented the FBI at least five times. You may be saying to yourself, OK, who cares? Who cares about the work history of this Barsoomian woman? Apparently someone does, because someone out there cares so much that they’ve “purged” all Barsoomian court documents for her Clinton representation in Hamburg vs. Clinton in 1998 and its appeal in 1999 from the DC District and Appeals Court dockets (?). Someone out there cares so much that the internet has been “purged” of all information pertaining to Barsoomian. Historically, this indicates that the individual is a protected CIA operative. Additionally, Lisa Barsoomian has specialized in opposing Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of the intelligence community. And, although Barsoomian has been involved in hundreds of cases representing the DC Office of the US Attorney, her email address is Lisa Barsoomian at NIH gov. The NIH stands for National Institutes of Health. This is a tactic routinely used by the CIA to protect an operative by using another government organization to shield their activities. It’s a cover, so big deal right? I mean what does one more attorney with ties to the US intelligence community really matter. It deals with Trump and his recent tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports, the border wall, DACA, everything coming out of California, the Uni-party unrelenting opposition to President Trump, the Clapper leaks, the Comey leaks, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusal and subsequent 14 month nap with occasional forays into the marijuana legalization mix …. and last but not least Mueller’s never-ending investigation into collusion between the Trump team and the Russians. Why does Barsoomian, CIA operative, merit any mention? BECAUSE….She is Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s WIFE….That’s why!!",a8ihs4,self.worldpolitics,,True

Air crashes involving the US Air Force in Japan continue,worldpolitics," Six US marines were missing after two American military aircraft crashed on Thursday during a refuelling operation off the coast of Japan, officials from both countries told AFP. The two planes -- an F-18 fighter and a C-130 tanker -- were involved in a 'mishap about 200 miles off of the coast of Japan around 2:00 am' according to a statement from the US Marines in Japan. A US defense official told AFP there had been a crash after the plane took off from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in southern Japan. A spokesman for Japan's Self-Defense Forces said that one of the airmen had been rescued but the immediate fate of the remaining crew members was unclear. The crew member was being assessed by doctors, the Marine statement said, adding that 'the search and rescue operations continue for the remaining six.' The C-130 was thought to be carrying five servicemen and the F-18 two, said the Japanese official, who added that Japan had scrambled four aircraft and three ships in the search. US media also reported five crew on the C-130 and two on the F-18. 'We are thankful for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's efforts as they immediately responded in the search and rescue operation,' the Marines said. The planes took off from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in southern Japan and were 'conducting regularly scheduled training when the mishap occurred,' the statement said. The circumstances of the mishap are currently under investigation, the military added. The US military has about 50,000 troops stationed in Japan and accidents are not uncommon. In November, a US navy fighter jet crashed into the sea off Japan's southern island of Okinawa and its two crew members were rescued alive. The US military has also experienced difficulties with its Osprey helicopters, with several emergency landings, a deadly crash and a piece of the chopper falling on the grounds of a Japanese school. Those incidents have stoked tensions between close military allies Washington and Tokyo and led to protests against the deployment of Ospreys by residents living near US bases.",a51xmf,self.worldpolitics,,True
The Persian Gulf,worldpolitics,"The Persian Gulf presents several TERRITORIAL DISPUTES in which several international agents claim sovereign rights for different reasons over the same area. Regionally, with a direct or indirect implication, we have Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Iraq. In addition to the regional claimants, there are many other international actors. The previous posts introduced the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. The solution seems to require a mutually exclusive relation amongst them because it is assumed that the sovereignty over the disputes territories can be granted to only one of them. Indeed, sovereignty is often regarded as an absolute concept (that is to say, exclusive, and not shareable). Post 7: Territorial disputes: sovereignty Link to the complete document Post 8: Territorial disputes: sovereignty (cont.) Link to the complete document The Persian Gulf is a clear example of a zero sum game, with many negative outcomes of different sorts (e.g. inefficient exploitation of natural resources, tension in international relations, and threat to local, regional and international peace). Thus, while these conflicts are in principle confined to specific areas and start with negative consequences primarily for the local population, they tend quickly to expand to the regional and—even—the international level (e.g. effects on international price of oil, war). There are many issues at stake domestically and internationally. Post 9: Territorial disputes: issues at stake Link to the complete document Time to solve the disputes in the Persian Gulf. Territory, in principle, can be defined as an area owned and possessed by the population (in land, water, space and, perhaps, cyberspace). Like population, it may have features that could cause controversy in TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. The next posts will review some of the features that constitute territory using the Persian Gulf conflicts as examples. Next time we center the attention on borders, natural resources and defense. Let us remember the way in why this series propose to deal with TERRITORIAL DISPUTES.The allocation of sovereignty will be given by: a) equal right to participate (egalitarian consensus principle); b) the nature and degree of participation depends on efficiency of accomplishing the particular objective/area/activity at issue (principle of efficiency); c) each party receives a benefit (in terms of rights and opportunities) that depends on what that party cooperates with (input-to-output ratio principle); and d) provided the party with greater ability and therefore greater initial participation rights has the obligation to bring the other two parties towards equilibrium (equilibrium proviso). I call this way of dealing with sovereignty conflicts or disputes the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. Many questions are to be expected. Amongst them: How is that translated into geographical borders amongst the many claimants? What about the exploration and exploitation of natural resources? Finally, in the hypothetical scenario that a party alien to the original dispute decided conduct activities (for example, exploitation of natural resources, invasion), who should defend the disputed area? The next posts on this blog series about TERRITORIAL DISPUTES will cover these questions. NOTE: based on Chapter 7, Núñez, Jorge Emilio. 2017.

US seeks cancellation of New START Treaty,worldpolitics," The demands issued by the US Congress regarding the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia are not acceptable, Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov told Sputnik. US Senator Tom Cotton and Congresswoman Liz Cheney introduced a bill on Wednesday that prevents extending the New START until the US president certifies to Congress that Russia has agreed to verifiably reduce its stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons and include its new weapons systems under the limits of the accord. 'It feels like US lawmakers mix all these issues to make it unacceptable for Russia, so that we reject them at once,' Antonov told Sputnik after the speech. 'Additional obstacles and barriers are being created that prevent the extension of the New START. A tactical nuclear weapon has nothing to do with these questions.' Following the cancellation of the G20 meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, Antonov emphasized it is important to have a conversation between the two leaders concerning developments of nuclear arms control and the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. 'It is high time for President Putin and President Trump to discuss strategic stability and the future of nuclear arms control, primarily the INF Treaty and the New START,' Antonov said. Russia still stands for continuing consultations with a view to preserve the INF Treaty as one of the cornerstones of international security, he added. Antonov continued that reestablishing dialogue between the Russian and US defence ministries is also necessary to better bilateral ties and avoid possible conflict in the future. Additionally, the Russian ambassador touched upon the development of a missile program by the United States and said it would impact the possibility of reaching new deals with Russia. Antonov, who took his diplomatic post in August 2017, visited Princeton University on Thursday to give a speech as well as answer questions addressing current events on the political arena and US-Russian relations. The New START Treaty entered into force in 2011 and covers a ten-year period with the possibility of a five-year extension. The treaty limits the number of deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, nuclear-armed bombers and nuclear warheads. The talks on extending the START Treaty have been delayed over mutual concerns about compliance. The Trump administration has announced plans to withdraw from the INF treaty. The treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, bans ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. ",a2zy3z,self.worldpolitics,,True

Kremlin Sours on Trump After His Repeated Putin Snubs,worldpolitics,"Bloomberg December 7, 2018 Kremlin Sours on Trump After His Repeated Putin Snubs By Ilya Arkhipov and Henry Meyer Donald Trump may have stood up Vladimir Putin once too often. After the U.S. president snubbed the Kremlin leader twice in less than a month, Russia is finally losing faith in Trump's promise to improve relations and bracing instead for increased tensions. Feted by Russian lawmakers with applause and champagne after his election in 2016, Trump's mercurial decision-making is increasingly seen as a liability in Moscow. Russian officials were taken aback when Trump tweeted that he was canceling talks with Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina hours before they were due to meet last week, a decision one of them called really bad. Since then, Russian frustration has steadily grown, according to four senior officials, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. 'This is a signal for us that it's difficult to deal with this person, that he's unreliable and unsuitable as a partner,' said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research group set up by the Kremlin. 'Russian patience is coming to an end.' The failure in Buenos Aires followed canceled talks between Trump and Putin in Paris on Nov. 11. It was the third such disappointment in 12 months, puncturing lingering Russian hopes of a breakthrough in U.S. relations nearly two years after Trump took office. As Putin warns of a new arms race over Trump's threat to abandon a landmark nuclear treaty, the Kremlin's left itself with little alternative than to dig in for confrontation over U.S. demands. While Trump invited Putin to visit Washington at their Helsinki summit, that's now 'out of the question,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. They're unlikely to meet again before the next G-20 summit in Japan in June, he said. Harder Line The disillusionment with Trump may mean Russia takes a harder line in talks with the U.S. on thorny issues including arms control, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria and the Iranian nuclear accord. It may also retaliate against possible future U.S. sanctions after Putin held back from taking measures in response to earlier rounds of penalties. The U.S. has accused Russia of repeatedly engaging in 'malign behavior' since Trump took office, making it politically difficult for him to work to improve relations even if he wanted to. Tensions may spike further in coming months if the U.S. decides to impose fresh sanctions over alleged Russian election meddling. The State Department may add penalties under a law invoked after a nerve-agent attack on a former spy in the U.K. Russia denies involvement in the attack. Even as Congress and the White House ratcheted up sanctions, the Kremlin worked tirelessly to embrace Trump. Putin declared at the Helsinki summit in July that he'd wanted Trump to win the election, while insisting Russia hadn't interfered. He also defended Trump after the U.S. president provoked a backlash at home by siding with Putin against the conclusions of American intelligence agencies that Russia did meddle. Naval Clash While Russian officials previously expressed 'understanding' of Trump's political difficulties amid U.S. investigations into meddling, this time, they openly cast doubt on him. The president blamed Russia's naval clash with Ukraine near Crimea for the cancellation. His decision was announced hours after his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about plans for a Trump real-estate investment in Moscow. Russia took account of Trump's explanation, though 'in my opinion, the real reason is in the internal political situation in the U.S.,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters. Russian state television, which formerly lauded Trump, now heaped ridicule on him. 'What kind of a man is this? First he says it will happen, then it won't,' said Evgeny Popov, host of the prime time 60 Minutes news program. 'This is just stupidity, he seems to be an unbalanced individual. Trump was never our friend - never!' 'Far Worse' Senior members of the ruling United Russia party even regretted Trump's victory, though Putin has dismissed the notion that a presidency of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would have averted the current frictions. 'It's far worse than it would have been under Clinton,' said Frants Klintsevich, a senator who sits on United Russia's governing council. 'She's an experienced politician and any of her actions would have been based on logic and some kind of discussion. Here we're seeing huge swings in one direction and another.' Putin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, insisted there was 'no offense taken' after the Kremlin had talked up the Argentina meeting only to be left embarrassed. Still, 'We won't beg the American side' for talks, he said. While Trump has continued to signal an interest in better ties, he's done so with less frequency publicly and his top aides have been quick to criticize Russian actions. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley called the attack on Ukrainian ships a 'reckless' and 'outlaw' action at an emergency Security Council meeting. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo called it a 'dangerous escalation and a violation of international law.' 'Unprovoked Attack' The U.S. and allies carried out a flight over Ukraine on Thursday under the Open Skies Treaty for the first time since 2014, to show America's commitment to the former Soviet republic and other nations following Russia's 'unprovoked attack' on the ships, the Defense Department said. While the U.S. seeks better relations with Russia, 'this cannot happen while its unlawful and destabilizing actions continue in Ukraine and elsewhere,' it said in a statement. The flight followed an incident in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday when a Russian warship and aircraft escorted an American destroyer after the U.S. navy carried out the first 'freedom of navigation operation' since 1987 near contested waters in the Sea of Japan. Russia's being told to 'give something' to improve relations, said Vladimir Lukin, a former Russian ambassador to the U.S. and deputy head of the upper house of parliament's international affairs committee. 'We can do 'give and take' but not 'give and give'.' Russia may try to exploit divisions between the U.S. and the European Union, said Kortunov from the Kremlin-backed research group. EU sanctions, unlike the American ones, may be lifted if Russia took steps to end the separatist conflict in Ukraine, he said. On the military front, Russia is already threatening to target European states if they host U.S. missiles after Trump withdraws from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. 'Don't try to talk to Russia from a position of force,' said Klintsevich, the lawmaker. 'You'll end up with such a headache you won't know what's hit you.'",a47d4c,self.worldpolitics,,True

USA Lose Arctic,worldpolitics," The US Coast Guard refused to conduct previously scheduled military exercises in the Arctic. This is due to the fact that the only nuclear-powered icebreaker Polar Star was built in the 70s and may simply fail. The US National Security Council planned to send the icebreaker to the exercises. However, there are no guarantees that there will be no “catastrophic consequences”. In this regard, the American military leadership fears that in the case of serious breakdowns, the US will have to seek help from Russia, which is considered unacceptable in the light of the current relations between the two countries. The US has another icebreaker Healy, but it can perform only a scientific function, and cannot be used in heavy ice. The absence of icebreakers has a strong effect on the development by the United States of this extremely important region. Previously, the States planned to build a new icebreaker for an army worth $ 750 million, but this item was excluded from the document at the initiative of some lawmakers after US President Donald Trump demanded five billion dollars to be allocated to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Consequently, in the coming years, a new American icebreaker will not appear in the Arctic. Thus, the United States is experiencing problems in the Arctic, and precedents for saving the Americans in the Arctic were in 2015, when Russian helicopter pilots who made a planned overflight of one of the areas discovered the frozen American submarine SeaWolf. The fact that the American submariners were in trouble, testified traces of the use of signal smoke bombs. The Russians landed nearby and sawed ice around the cabin with chainsaws, freeing the crew from captivity, who could not get to the surface on their own. This story had a wide resonance in the United States, where it was noted that the American submariners were not well prepared for war with the Russians in the Arctic. In addition, the incident of 2011 surfaced, when during the Arctic Ice Exercise, the submarine Connecticut was stuck in the ice. Then the Americans coped on their own and were able to get out of the ice captivity. The last incident occurred in March 2018, when Hartford nuclear submarine, which participated in the Ice Exercise-2018, was stuck in the ice. According to the plan of the exercises, the submarine, having completed a series of maneuvers, was to emerge and launch the Tomahawk cruise missiles. But something went wrong and on March 10, the submarine was firmly frozen into the ice, without completing the combat training task. The Russians were ready to help, but the American submariners caused their helicopter to rescue the boat from the ice captivity. So, the current concerns of the US Coast Guard, which has long been eyeing the Arctic Ocean and the Northern Sea Route, about conducting exercises are not in vain. And sending the Polar Star to the Arctic alone would be a very risky business. Thus, despite the great desire, American attack aircraft carriers with squadrons of escort ships without the support of an icebreaking fleet simply will not enter the Arctic Ocean, especially during the winter navigation period. Therefore, three years ago, the United States Senate Committee on Armed Forces Affairs noted the fact that America lags significantly behind other countries, primarily Russia, in the number of icebreakers. Russia, on the contrary, holds all the planned activities in the Arctic region. Thus, during the Vostok-2018 military exercises, which took place in September 2018, the Northern Fleet Forces successfully conducted maneuvers in the Chukotka region in the Bering Sea. In addition, it is known that during the Center-2019 exercises, planned for August-September 2019, some of the important stages will take place in the Arctic - from the New Earth to the Novosibirsk Islands. Thus, the US military leadership stresses that even though the United States has developed an action plan in the Arctic, they are seriously lagging behind Russia, which has been concentrating on activities in the region for a long time. However, the loss of the US Arctic is not threatened. They understand that they need to speed up efforts, increase investment in the same nuclear-powered icebreakers and approach more flexibly the issue of creating various alliances in the development of the Arctic.",a9kqxe,self.worldpolitics,,True

Christmas In Japanese Style,worldpolitics," Faced once with Western trends, Japan has irrevocably changed. Americanization has penetrated into every area of the Japanese world order, thereby changing the age-old foundations. In the sixteenth century, the Land of the Rising Sun encountered European culture. It was then that the European weapons and Christianity penetrated into Japan. The first Christian missionary to acquaint the Asian country with Christmas was Francis Xavier. Then there was the custom to decorate the church, streets and houses with coniferous branches. Nevertheless, the island nation was still trying to isolate itself from foreign influences by building a “Bamboo Wall”. After 215 years of voluntary imprisonment, European warships broke the wall, and Western civilization rushed into Japan. Currently, the Japanese Christmas customs are strongly Americanized. Japanese Christmas 'kurimasu' marked with noise and scope. Young people celebrate this day in restaurants and discos. The traditional attributes of the holiday are: Christmas songs and gifts, and with them the pre-holiday rush in the shops, Santa Claus, festive illuminations, Christmas cakes. Such a craze in Christmas seems strange, especially since this is not a national holiday. Moreover, this Christian holiday is celebrated throughout Japan, despite the fact that less than 2% of Japanese people are Christians. According to sociological research, despite the high level of temple attendance and observance of rites, most of the Japanese population do not consider themselves religious. The Japanese perceive Christmas not as a religious custom, but as a way of holding an event. Christmas for the Japanese is another annual holiday. Christmas is not the only custom that comes from the West. Japanese wedding is also a thing of the past. It was replaced by the traditional Christian wedding in the church. Far back in the past are the traditions of ancient Japan, they are being replaced by Western holidays, and with them American customs and the Western worldview, which are far from the best influence on the cultural development of the nation. Thus, Japanese culture loses its originality, giving way to bright holidays and senseless customs, in which the Japanese themselves do not make any sense.",a9vibg,self.worldpolitics,,True

I understand those waters are vital for Ukrainian trade, so have they seen any use before this recent incident?",a2wi08,self.worldpolitics,,True

Donald Trump and his gaslighting can unite the people,worldpolitics,"In a world of Donald J. Trump and his gaslighting of America which was the word of 2017. That is so common place in 2018 that it is used as a weapon on those who are triggered. Sadly what most do not realize is that gaslighting is really a way to make you the most vulnerable. Be it with anger at what with said on either side. Be it in joyful or angered agreement and how you feel that the world is against you. Then the on the opposition side that you are angered with the audacity of the statement makes you lash out in verbal harassment and joke making at those who support the message or at the messenger themselves. Either which way the President accomplished his goals and that was engagement on a topic that will make people talk. He does not care about the context just that the engagement happens. With blinded with their preferred goggles of choice on. When both sides can not see because of those goggles that they are both fighting against the same enemy. That they both conservative and liberal are at a equal disadvantage in this political world. Where politicians are paid off by Exxon-Mobil, Monsanto, Johnson Johnson, and anyone else that has deep enough pockets to make a political contribution in the name of moving the party line forward. With that line drawn by the Reagan Administration when they took out laws preventing corporations from making payments to political parties. Because of this since the rich are getting richer with each year they have and will with more regulations ending which is all cost cutting to these giant corporations. Which is another way of showing their investors that they are making them more money. The environment and the human toll that comes from this does not mean anything to these types of humanity. Sadly, Donald J. Trump the United States Government and so many are at a tipping point of corporate greed and making as much as they can. That they are not willing or do not care about the cost to the world at large. Then it is time for the people to stand up and make moves against these powers. All because they no longer are for the people but for the few. There are more poor than millionaires. There are more corrupt policemen who take bribes to make ends meet than millionaires. But is money really power? Is profit really anything more than waste? Why must companies keep making record profits off the backs of slave labor in Africa or the abysmal conditions in China? To some of you I know you do not mind this. But here in America you have Wal-Mart employees who are majorly white Christians being paid minuscule wages then told to get food stamps and etc. That same greed that ruins water supplies in Costa Rica causing the people to flee so we can enjoy cheap pineapples, avocados and palm oil. I know you asking what is Palm Oil and why should I care? Palm oil is used in products to help keep their moisture. The reason you should care about it is that orangutans and even humans are losing the native lands to big agriculture all in the name of progress. But unlike the humans that are moving in mass across the globe be it from war, famine, or corporations ruining the environment around these farmers and indigenous species and humans. They are being killed even when videos show a large male orangutan take on a bulldozer trying to tear down its home. We celebrate that orangutan by buying more products that have palm oil in all because we do not read labels. Maybe we don’t know the facts but when we do does that change the way you view things? Does children mining in Africa offend you? How about children in the Southern United States living in third world conditions based on the latest United Nations report. But that does not end there as that heads to Los Angelas, Seattle, Portland, and Miami and any place where humanity is not given decency of a roof over their head. When so many of us can not afford a $500 unexpected expense let alone $100 or $50. This world is backwards folks. Why are we fighting to make a small fraction of what we are worth. Why do we work for $7.25 an hour? Why do choose that we are worth that? Why do we not have unions that helped us get our 40 hour work weeks children out of the work place and vacations days. Why do we turn our back on progress that helps the everyday man? I know it is the man who is afraid of losing his job to a person of color. Because he or she feels inequality in their lives. Be it in education, looks, or money. Unfortunately the world has their goggles their blinders their hate. They refuse to see the others side because they are hurt to much to care anymore. This is the effect of the corporate world. We have been trained to make money for those at the top and accept what we are given. Never to ask for more and when we do they will only budge a small fraction. Never enough to hurt them just enough to appease those who riled up. This is servitude plain and simple as you begging for the scraps from those at the table as you sit next to the dog. Yet some of you have it cozier than others and can get places at the table in baby bassinets or strollers if you need to moved away quickly and thats okay with you. But for us on the floor looking up its not okay. We want the real food not the scraps. I say that because in the 1920’s their was a piece of legislation that was sold to the American people and it caused a great collapse in the stock market. That theory was Horse and Sparrow where the horse will eat and poo so the sparrow will have extra seeds to eat. This analogy was repurposed in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s by Ronald Reagan which was given to us as Trickle Down Economics. You know what both have in common? Both caused either the largest in the Great Stock Market Crash of 1938 to what we are seeing today with the stock market in total flux as we have hit a end game for corporate greed. Where the only way to assure more profits is consolidating of corporations into mego-corporations. When that is not an option you find new cheaper ways to get your products made and distributed. Even if the cost to the humanity and the environment can be severe. Yet here we are as a human race watching this happen. We see the evils we know our enemies. It is our employers who won’t cover health care that can. It is our government paying the corporations to stay here with tax cuts. That they used to only enrich themselves and did a few feel good stories with bonuses. Which was a joke at best to all that got one. But did we see real wage gains? Did we really see real growth in sectors of society that can help a lot of people no. Instead we are seeing our friends, relatives and love ones get hurt by a system that uses its people and does not care about nurturing. That is not sustainable anymore so many of us have watched our parents try and do this impossible dream. When in reality the dream is co-op where we the people own the company where we have a board chosen by us. A board that wants to make the profits be for the company as whole not just executives and the owners. I know you might be wondering what those profits could be used for? How about health care with recommendations for mental health. It’s time to end the stigma its better to talk than hold it in. Now how about these as well maternity leave, help with college or trade school maybe even raises for people so they can live better lives. All of this is possible if we come together and stop fighting. So let me ask you this are you ready to make peace and see are real enemy is not each other but our governments and the corporations that support them?",abag4s,self.worldpolitics,,True

Does the U.S. really help with rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan?,worldpolitics,"Sen Rand Paul has falsely claimed today , as usual, that the U.S. is spending billions of dollars on rebuilding the infrastructure of Iraq and Afghanistan. Sen Paul has also said that these countries must take care of their own business and the U.S. money must only be allocated towards projects that can renew the infrastructure in the U.S. &#x200B; Well, the billions of dollars that being spent are not for the people of Iraq or Afghanistan or their infrastructure. Most of the spending is going towards the outrageous defense contracts. And this is why we continuously see the corrupt warlords-senators like Lindsey Graham and John McCain (in the past) who vehemently defend wars and attacking other countries. &#x200B; So the problem is not with Iraq or Afghanistan, in fact the people of these countries do really hate Americans and their administration after all the chaos and destruction and millions of people who died by the US militarily. Americans are now being looked at, around the world, as merciless killers, who know nothing but blood shed and genocides. I know this is not what the FAKE U.S. media want you to hear, instead they want you to know that these countries are always in need for the American intervention. &#x200B; I don't blame Sen Paul's ignorance, he is a product of a society that is totally brainwashed since its establishment. &#x200B;",a8zl7e,self.worldpolitics,,True

Expropriation without compensation of land in South Africa,worldpolitics,"Good day all. I would just like to inform everyone that the South African parliament today passed a motion whereby land can be seized by the ANC communist regime. These seizures will affect everyone. It won't matter if you are black or white, your farm will now belong to the state. However, it will mostly affect white farmers and to use the president's words 'the land will be redistributed to *our* people'. Now I don't know if it refers to politicians or what he actually means by that. For those of you who don't know what land expropriation without compensation will result in, here is what may happen. Food scarcity, inflation will sky rocket, investors will become more and more scarce, jobs will be lost, the Rand will tumble and as a result everything will become more expensive. Skilled workers and farmers will start to leave the country (Russia and Australia have already indicated that they will welcome our farmers, who are regarded as some of the best in the world). So the little amount of people who will still stay won't have any security as to weather or not they will have a farm the next day. The politicians has already indicated that there about 140 farms that they want to expropriate, most of these farms are on coal and mineral rich lands which the government wants to seize without paying the farmers, or pay them a 10th of what the farm is worth. I plead to the international community to please support us as South Africans who are struggling more and more by the day. These last couple of days we've even had parts of the day that we didn't have electricity, the country is falling apart under the communist ANC regime. Please put pressure on your governments to acknowledge what is going in South Africa and take action against the government is they fully implement land expropriation without compensation.

What these people don't realise is that when your fellow neighbors have it better, you inevitably have it better too, less illegal immigration, more trade, more tourism and the list goes on...

George Clooney and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science's dance with The White Helmets,worldpolitics," ...the truth would also come out that it was the Western governments, their media and military intelligence agencies that were the sponsors of the murderous terrorist gangs that had held civilians under siege. An important part of the West's vile charade was exposed on December 20 when a United Nations conference heard from a range of speakers on the crimes committed by the so-called White Helmets against civilians. Expert testimony was given by investigative British journalist Vanessa Beeley as well as Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia, among others. As Canadian journalist Eva Bartlett points out, not one Western media news outlet reported on the irrefutable, comprehensive evidence presented at the conference, showing how the White Helmets were complicit in committing violations against civilians with the support of Western governments in premeditated propaganda stunts. The Western lionized 'rescue group' were fully integrated with the terrorist militants, participating in atrocities, yet spreading their fabricated videos with the help of Western news media. Their violations included gassing kidnapped children, executing civilians and trafficking bodily organs. ",aaksre,self.worldpolitics,,True

Theresa May's Tory government is currently running a Propaganda War against its own people in an organized Mass Disinformation Campaign called the 'Integrity Initiative',worldpolitics,"This campaign consists of: A £2.2m UK government (i.e. taxpayer) funded core of extreme Neocons who are paid Lobbyists for the War Industry and do nothing but tell lies all the time.

6 Key Takeaways From The Comey Deposition Transcript,worldpolitics,"## 1. We didn’t learn much — but that was significant. Comey repeatedly responded to questions about the Trump campaign investigation by pleading ignorance, establishing he did not know of many of the facts underlying both the launch of Crossfire Hurricane and the continuing investigation. That’s concerning. For instance, in response to Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy’s characterization of Crossfire Hurricane as a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, Comey claimed that the FBI was not investigating Trump or the Trump campaign, but had instead “opened investigations on four Americans to see if there was any connection between those four Americans and the Russian interference effort. And those four Americans did not include the candidate.” Yet Comey had never seen the “FBI’s initiation document,” which Gowdy indicated referenced the “Trump campaign.” Further questioning revealed that Comey had no knowledge concerning the agent responsible for drafting the FBI’s late-July 2016 initiation document for Crossfire Hurricane, did not know who approved the draft of the “initial plan for the Russian investigation,” and never read or saw the initiation document. In fact, Comey said he didn’t even know how the FBI launches counterintelligence investigations, who has the authority to launch a counterintelligence investigation into a major political campaign, or whether such an investigation would need to be approved by the FBI Director. Comey did note that “there’s documentation in criminal investigations and in counterintelligence investigations to explain the predication for the opening of a file, that is, the basis for the opening of a file.” These exchanges raise three concerning points: First, that FBI agents — including the biased, “We’ll stop Trump from becoming president” duo of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page — had the ability, without Comey’s involvement, to launch an investigation into the Trump campaign. Second, Comey’s testimony shows that he may not have known the official basis for, and scope of, the probe because he never saw the “initiation document.” And third, the same agents who launched the investigation craft the documentation to explain “the basis for the opening of a file.” So, if the agents wanted to pin the launch of Crossfire Hurricane on George Papadopoulos’ supposed foreknowledge of the WikiLeak hack into DNC emails, they would merely need to list that as the predicate for opening the investigation. ## 2. Comey buys the George Papadopoulos pretext, But that’s because he doesn’t know the facts. Although Comey testified that he never saw the “initiation document” and had no idea who drafted or approved the initiation of the probe, he unequivocally stated that the Steele dossier did not prompt the Russia probe. When asked how he knew that, Comey said: >Because I know what the basis was for starting the investigation. It was the information we’d received about a conversation that a Trump foreign — campaign foreign policy adviser had with an individual in London about stolen emails that the Russians had that would be harmful to Hillary Clinton. It was weeks or months later that the so-called Steele dossier came to our attention. There are several problems with Comey’s explanation. First, the evidence released to date ",a50ane,self.worldpolitics,,True

Russian response to American missile defense in Europe,worldpolitics," Despite the Russian-US agreement on the limitation and reduction of strategic offensive arms, Washington has repeatedly violated the existing balance of forces in its favor. Judging by the actions that the States are currently undertaking (from leaving the INF Treaty, to deploying a global missile defense system in Europe), it can be said with confidence that in the near future, the US will not only not abandon attempts to eliminate the Strategic Nuclear Forces of Russia and will continue build their nuclear capacity to solve the problem. In response to the deployment of the US missile defense system in Europe, Russia has prepared a series of countermeasures. First of all, military units are equipped with the latest rocket weapons and equipment. This is a new mine-based missile system 'Sarmat' with a heavy liquid rocket. The rearmament of this missile system is scheduled to begin in 2021, it will replace the existing Voyevod complex. In addition, currently there is a serial production of samples of the new Avangard missile system with hypersonic military equipment. This complex has unique combat characteristics: its installation will significantly increase the ability to overcome the missile defense system and defeat point attacks. The first samples of this weapon will be put on alert in the next year. As of today, the high-precision hypersonic Dagger missile system is on test-combat duty. From December 1, 2018, the Peresvet combat laser systems were put into service. All these means will provide guaranteed overcoming of the most modern anti-missile systems.",a9krzu,self.worldpolitics,,True

Trump's double standards,worldpolitics," The use of such a term as the policy of double standards can be observed more and more often in modern society. In essence, this is an assessment of the same action, according to different criteria, from the positive side if it is your ally or negatively, if it is your competitor with the aim of discrediting and denigrating him to the world community. Undoubtedly, the United States is the most striking manifestation of the policy of double standards. Double standards have become the norm for Washington, which pursues its interests around the world with maniacal perseverance, covering its aggressive policy with a “comfortable” and dense curtain of democracy. 'Double standards' are constantly manifested in US foreign policy, where hypocrisy has long been firmly established as a national feature of politicians. The hypocrisy regarding human rights, which American politicians actively support in other countries, but are strictly suppressed at home, is especially limitless. In order to present a clear picture of the double standards policy pursued by Washington, we should refer to its examples. US President Donald Trump is known to the world community for his attitude to migrants. But the standards of his policies are diversified. He repeatedly, referring to various human rights norms, called on European leaders to accept migrants from the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, they sharply condemned such countries as Germany, which decided to limit the flow of migrants to the territory of their country. At the same time, US meet migrants with rubber bullets and gas. In order to prevent the 'caravan of migrants' from entering the American territory, on the Mexican border, the American authorities deployed the military, and the US border guard strengthens it with barbed wire and concrete blocks. President Trump demanded that the Mexican government stop the 'caravan of migrants', which is moving to the United States from Central America, threatening to use the US armed forces and close the southern border of the country, through which daily passes $ 1.7 billion in bilateral trade. These actions are nothing but a policy of double standards: Europe must accept all migrants from different countries, while the US should not accept anyone. Another example of the same double-standard policy towards the same migrants from Central America was led by Bolivian President Evo Morales: “Trump applies double standards, wanting“ love, understanding and joy ”to his people on Thanksgiving Day on November 22, at the same time , ordering his military to use deadly weapons against migrants from Central America. ' However, it is known that by these actions President Trump violates the current American Constitution and the Bill of Rights that prohibits the use of the military in such situations, because every second American is, in fact, a migrant coming from another country. Thus, Trump turns the famous American dream into a nightmare. After such actions, the US moralizing statements about democracy and respect for human rights lose all value. Because behind them lies only the interests of the United States and nothing more. Once again, the US leadership has shown that all US policy, no matter what sphere it may be, is saturated with two faces. Double standards have become the norm for the United States - a country that positions itself as a state that is a recognized 'engine of democracy.'",a7a2qm,self.worldpolitics,,True

What is Globalism? Globalism is Neoliberalism which is Corporatism,worldpolitics,"The term Globalism has been around from at least the 1960's but its origins come from Cecil Rhodes Round Tables which were set up around 1900 as a mechanism for Rhodes and his allies from the British and South African Oligarchs to take over the world. Globalism is another term for Neoliberalism, which is another term for Corporatism. It is principally pushed by Neoliberal wealthy elites who pretend to be lefties, but are actually Corporatists or Corporate Fascists. **Globalism** The aim of Globalism is to transfer all power and wealth from ordinary people to a handful of Banking Elites, Oligarchs and major Corporate CEO's. The ultimate aim is to set up an anti democratic, authoritarian one world government where ordinary people are effectively serfs and have no say, in a system of Neo-Feudalism. We are very nearly already there. This is being constantly carried out by transferring ever increasing powers from elected local governments to massive governmental Super States, such as the EU or the Federal government in Washington DC. A great example of a Globalist policy was Obama's Corporate Power Grab TPP and TTIP, Corporate protectionist deals, which transferred power from elected legislatures to transnational tribunals staffed by Corporate lawyers acting as Judge and Jury. TPP, TISA and TTIP agreements are massive Corporate power grabs dressed up as trade deals  'Neo-libs' are NOT Centrists. They are extremist supporters of Perpetual War, Corruption, Corporatism, Authoritarianism the Transfer of all wealth power from ordinary ppl to the Oligarchs CEOs in the top 0.01%. What is Globalism? Clue: Its NOT what the Corporate Establishment tells you it is  Neoliberalism.

Why The Political Spectrum Is Not Dependable And Why We Should Abolish The Two Way Party System.,worldpolitics,"A persistent and stubborn belief when it comes to the subject of politics is that everyone stands somewhere on this faulty spectrum. Or that some political entity resembles a trait of 'right' or 'left' and they are therefore one or the other. Most of these 'Republicans' and 'Democrats' are ignorant of the importance of historic knowledge (or they purposely hide it from you) and I will be happily obliged to give out non-opinionated and non-fabricated **historic** evidence to support my claim. Conservatives will have a belief of free market and advocate for the right, yet if you move to the extreme right there is market restrictions as with the historic example of National Socialism (Hitler), and Liberals will have a belief of free speech and advocate for the left, yet once again the extremity of this leads to no free speech whatsoever with the example of Joseph Stalin. Now some people will try to still justify this flaw and say that the political spectrum is like a circle and all extremist views will lead to totalitarianism (one party government), yet this is still not legitimate to defend the political spectrum. The absolute truth is that both sides are loaded with disjointed mixes, for example, what does opposing abortion have to do with favoring capital punishment? Many can favor abortion yet not favor capital punishment and this doesn't make them a rightist or leftist. The defenders of the political spectrum will say that each side has a core value or intention, they might suggest that conservatives want to 'conserve' and progressives want to 'change', yet these defenders (usually politicians) won't state what it is that they are 'conserving' or 'changing'. Both sides want to change gun laws, taxes, and various other policies. Now that I have established a hopefully sound and reasonable brief claim, it leaves us wondering. What is a Democrat or Republican? The answer is simple, they are just separate political groups that compete to no end and in the process they are dividing the american people. The solution to fix this political turmoil is by abolishing the two way party system of the United States, no Republican or Democratic politicians will follow through with this claim for they will damage the power of their party, the power belongs to all the people regardless of class, belief, and identity. If you still aren't convinced look at our constitution and you'll soon realize that there were no mentions of political parties at all. George Washington warned of these political groups to emerge and not long after, the civil war occurred due to this ignorance. Now history seems to be repeating itself and it is our obligation to save our home, we **MUST** abolish the two way party system.

Shifting Reasons for US Involvement in the Middle East and the Mounting Democrat War Machine,worldpolitics,"The reasons for American involvement in the Middle East have been many. Ultimately, the true reason is simply that “Jews want it,” and are able to push it through their various lobbying groups, their positions within the government and their control of the American media apparatus. As is the case with every Jewish agenda, the rationalization for a certain action is post-hoc. Any explanation for American involvement in the Middle East can be used as long as enough people can be convinced to go along with it. These are those that have been used so far: Revenge for 9/11 – this was the justification for invading Afghanistan Preventing an invasion and/or nuking of America – stopping Saddam Hussein from building weapons of mass destruction which could result in Iraq nuking America, preemptively, for no reason or because “they hate our freedoms” was used to justify the Iraq invasion (in the lead-up to the Iraq war, about half of Americans also believed that Saddam Hussein had personally ordered the 9/11 attack due to the way the media had covered it) Giving democracy to people who are oppressed by dictators – Bush 2’s invasion of Iraq was called “Operation Iraqi Freedom,” with the concept of “freeing Iraq from dictatorship” being mixed in with preventing Iraq from invading America and this was used repeatedly since then Stealing oil – the leftist opposition to the Iraq war presented the alternative explanation that Bush was invading Iraq to personally steal oil (this is despite the fact that Saddam was selling oil at a low price before the war) Helping protesters bring democracy by stopping trucks of government-backed rape-gangs – Libya was bombed and turned into a complete disaster zone ostensibly because people were protesting against the government Preventing terrorism in the West – despite the fact that most terrorists in the West were stating their reason for attacking the West as revenge for Western meddling in the Middle East, meddling in the Middle East was sold as a way to prevent terrorism (the obvious option of simply banning Moslems from Western countries was not ever presented as a potential solution to terrorism) Stopping humanitarian crises – it has been repeatedly claimed that Assad is gassing his own people due to being insane or just generally evil (Saddam was accused of the same) Fighting Russia – since the intervention in Syria by Russia, simply “fighting Russia” is being used as a reason for being in Syria Fighting Donald Trump – now that Trump has ordered a pullout of Syria, the newest reason we should be in Syria is that Donald Trump is against being in Syria They will just throw out everything and see what sticks. It has been extremely disheartening to watch all of this, to witness how easy it is to manipulate the entire population of America with puerile nonsense. But the sad truth of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of people will go along with whatever they are told to go along with by whomever they view as representing authority, and thus far, the mainstream media has represented authority and that mainstream media is controlled by Jews. Now, however, we have Donald Trump as an authority figure, as well as a robust alternative media on the internet (which Jews are continually attempting to shut down), along with figures like Tucker Carlson and Ann Coulter who are providing a realistic view of reality. Watch Tucker make this Obama official squirm trying to justify endless war by criss-crossing many of the various reasons listed above.  Laura Ingraham deserves a shoutout as well – “Democrats sound like they went to the Paul Wolfowitz school of foreign policy” is a borderline Alt-Right dog whistle.  She needs to go easy on the plastic surgery though. She looks alright now, but if she goes any further, she could end up going full-Meg Ryan and be unable to appear on TV. Laura: just let yourself age, babe. It will be fine. Although it is possible that this pullout from Syria will not happen, as any moment now a staged provocation could occur, I think that the people have sufficiently gotten the message that these wars are stupid, and it is going to be difficult to get this whole “forever war” agenda going again. If it does get going again, it will happen on the left this time. There is no specific reason why the modern left wouldn’t support war. They certainly tolerated it with Obama, who continued steadily with the Bush 2 program. I predict that resources are going to be shifted into promoting interventionism as a humanitarian issue designed to appeal to the left, and this will be yet another reason that the Jews want to oust Donald Trump. With baby boomer Israel-firsters dying off, and the right-wing having fully embraced populism, it simply makes logical sense to shift this agenda into a Democrat-palatable form.Kamala Harris, who remains the favorite to become the 2020 Democrat nominee, is married to a Jewish man and has previously supported action in Syria.  Since Trump was elected, there has already been mounting support among regular Democrat voters for foreign interventionism, matching the Republican decline in support for these strange projects. According to a Pew poll, the Democrats were already more in support of war than Republicans in 2017, and that gap is going to widen massively following the media’s war against Trump’s dirty hippy anti-war agenda.This is to say that it is likely to become an issue in the 2020 election – the Jews will not be able to resist forcing it as an issue – and Trump needs to take note of that, because if he successfully ends these wars, he is going to have the more popular position.

Prediction: Pelosi is primed to become a bipartisan hero by approving the Trump Wall funding while simaltaneously shifting Democrats to admit that Illegals are trying to attack Democracy,worldpolitics,"This is not a rant or conspiracy theory. Yesterday Pelosi sat with Trump who delivered an ultimatum: fund the wall or the government shuts down. Pelosi can not and will not allow that to happen which left her, and the media, in a pickle... how can she approve the wall and still keep her constituents viewing her as an an Anti-Trump bipartisan super hero? Newsweek seems to have figured it out.  In this article the impatient would-be illegal faction makes an ultimatum to let us in or give us $50,000. Not only do many people see foreign blackmail as an act of terrorism but when asked what justifies the demand he blames THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION! The atrocities he is referencing all happened after Obama took office and Democrats cheered his actions!  So now all Pelosi has to do is reference this, turn the brainwashed Dems against illegals, and fund the wall and she becomes the super woman speaker of the House of Representatives who bravely ushered in a bipartisan effort to protect our borders AND gets credit for controlling the Trump situation. In short, everyone wins. Keep in mind this scenario is a huge win for the Democrats which will strengthen their cause for a 2020 reclaimation of the white house, so downvoting and insults are going to be from people who love Trump so much that they don't want anything good to happen for Democrats. Also keep in mind that it will be a win for Trump and almost guarantee a second term. So what do you think about this prediction?",a5jkqz,self.worldpolitics,,True

Repentance will not be,worldpolitics," Currently, the leadership of Japan is embellishing Japanese aggression during the Second World War. Asian countries that suffered from the Japanese invaders have repeatedly accused Japan of not recognizing and hiding from the world community the horrors of the crimes of the Japanese militarists. The Japanese imperialists, who militarily occupied the Asian countries and carried out ominous colonial-fascist domination, committed unforgettable anti-human crimes. According to the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied occupying forces, General Douglas MacArthur, on January 19, 1946, an international military tribunal for the Far East was organized in Tokyo. 29 people were brought before the court, mostly members of the cabinet of General Hideki Tojo. The continuation of the Tokyo process from December 25 to December 30, 1949 was the Khabarovsk trial of twelve former soldiers of the Japanese Kwantung Army accused of developing and using bacteriological weapons. Among the defendants in the Khabarovsk process were the commander of the Kwantung Army, General Yamada Otozoo, the former head of the health department, Lieutenant-General Medical Service Kajitsuka Ryuji, former head of the bacteriological unit No. 731, Major General Kawashima Kiosi, former scientific officer of the bacteriological unit No. 100, Lieutenant Lieutenant Kharazakura, the former Bacteriological Unit No. 731 medical technician of the branch number 162 squad number 731 Kurushima Yuji. It should be recalled that the 731-detachment located twenty kilometers from Harbin was a Japanese center for the preparation of bacteriological warfare. The causative agents of typhoid, tetanus, anthrax, smallpox, cholera and many other terrible diseases were produced here. In the 731st detachment, at least 600 people died each year from experiments on contagion of prisoners with acute infectious diseases. The Japanese army carried out criminal acts prohibited by both the Geneva and Hague agreements. What was done by the Japanese military is a crime against humanism. Under the leadership of the Japanese microbiologist Shiro Ishii, over such inhuman experiments were carried out over the prisoners that a man could never have thought of. 'Research staff' conducted an autopsy of living people with sequential extraction of organs, inculcated unhappy anthrax, smallpox and other fatal diseases in order to see how a bacteriological weapon would work. The military tribunals in Tokyo and Khabarovsk qualified the actions of the soldiers of the Kwantung Army as war crimes against humanity. The materials of these trials have not lost their actual significance today either, because the same dangerous tendencies are again reviving and developing in Japan, which ultimately led its leaders to the defendants' bench. At the same time, the Japanese government still denies the atrocities committed by members of Detachment 731 during the war, citing a lack of historical data, and most of the monsters were in no way punished. The Americans who entered the territory of Japan promised members of Detachment 731 immunity from prosecution in exchange for all developments in the field of biological weapons. In addition, it should be noted that today war criminals in Japan are revered as heroes. The Japanese government introduced the practice of posthumous awarding of thousands of soldiers and officers of the former imperial army. Japanese officials and politicians, as well as millions of ordinary Japanese, annually visit the Yasukuni Shrine, in which the souls of almost two and a half million dead soldiers and officers, including more than a thousand, convicted after World War II for war crimes and 14 of them, are worshiped. The pilgrimage of Japanese top officials to the Yasukuni temple is perceived as evidence of the absence of remorse for the war crimes of World War II and the course of remilitarizing Japan.",a9vh7n,self.worldpolitics,,True

So i was working and i had some free time and i thought why not write down my idea of a 'perfect world' this is roughly a 2 hour text so it's basically something like a scetch of what's to become. It's nowhere near complete and i encourage and ask of you to put your opinions in it and complete it.,worldpolitics," 1. AI controlled humanity via a site accessible to everyone. No more humans controlling humans. The AI will “hear” every single person’s “voice” and calculate his/her opinion. An AI cannot be bought, it cannot be scared/intimidated, and it will always be real/truth/fair. 2. No human could possibly own a piece of this planet. We are guests here and it’s all for everyone. The whole planet will be “redesigned” in order to achieve minimal destroying of it and maximum happiness for the people. (Same space for all humans, around 30-40 square meters per person (Without kitchen and WC). If you want a bigger house then you will have to go to another planet and build there as many houses as you want cause it’s better to say : let’s visit Mike’s galaxy tomorrow and explore the 15th planet out of 200.000 that exist in the galaxy that Mike decided to stay at, than to say let’s see Mike’s 20 square meter hole In a fucked up neighborhood with rats and cockroaches and moody murderous people) Obviously travelling will be free everywhere to any place for everyone except for people’s main houses on a specific planet (If I decide to build a house on the 2nd planet out of 200.000 any person visiting this particular 2nd planet would have to notify me and they would have to land a bit farther from my house in order to not bother me). 3. Most houses and building will be destroyed and new cities will be built. 4. Guns and any kind of weapon will be destroyed and recycled for metals in order to build the space “earth” which will accommodate people that want to travel the space. 5. Love for each other is the most vital and the first thing all humans should learn. We are all unique and different and every single person is interesting in his own way and you should strive to meet every single one of them. There is no person identical to another and there never will be, we all think differently and our brains and the way we think is amazing. 6. Music and art in general will be welcomed and all humans should give them a try. 7. AI controlled robots will be doing all the labor work (Humans can still choose to work whenever they want) in order to make everything free (Robots will farm, mine, process, package etc). 8. Schools, Universities and science laboratories vastly built and free for everyone regardless of age. (Even a 3 year old child should be able to experiment with rocket science and have his opinion heard) 9. No more “professions” and study fields. Most professions will not exist anymore (We don’t need bankers if humanity stops using money, we don’t need lawyers, doctor knowledge will be learnt to everyone along with survival basics but most doctors will be robots) 10. Science about immortality and space exploration are the top subjects every single person should spend some time on. (If we have 3 Billion people working on immortality, an infinite amount of resources and all the findings/knowledge being uploaded to the core AI, it would take humanity less than 1 year to achieve complete immortality). (We need to be immortal if we want to travel through space to other planets). (Immortality should come at a price-you cannot have any more children for as long as you stay on planet EARTH) (Immortality means : No more periods for women, no need to eat and drink for humans (Or at least minimize it so that 1 pill kind of thingy would be enough to keep us alive a few thousand years), no need for oxygen etc). 11. Everything you want to own you will have to build yourself. (Your house and your car and your bike etc must all be created 100% by you – (For the sake of the example we’ll take a car) meaning you would have to travel to a mine, get help from some robot to mine the materials you need like metals, plastic, glass etc. You would then have to go to a factory and get help from another robot to show you the steps and the blueprints to process the raw materials you mined to turn them into usable materials for your car. Directions and guides will be available at all robots and they will be helping you step by step to create your own car. (It should take a few months for you to create your own car from scratch if you spend around 2-3 hours a day for it). Same thing applies to house building: You will have to mine stone, process sand to create glass, make concrete etc. 12. Space robots will be sent in order to mine materials outside our planet EARTH in order to have enough for everyone (Our planet’s resources are very limited) 13. Space “planets” built by robots in the space which will be used to travel to other planets (Like Star Wars). 14. Free apartments in skyscrapers for those who live alone or with a partner while houses are for those who live as a family (2 parents and at least 1 child) (Like mentioned earlier it would be around 30-40 square meters per person). 15. Environmental houses and skyscrapers only with lots of trees and flowers which will be built by robots and volunteers humans preferably by 3D printing the materials or the usual stone/concrete. 16. No more borders, no more ethnicities, no more religions. We are all one and there are no gods and demons – period. 17. Humanity will be focused on exploring the world/galaxy/universe, learning about everything, meeting new people, advancing humanity to the whole universe, tasting, feeling, smelling, hearing and experiencing everything this amazing universe has to offer and having fun while the machines will be doing all the work. 18. A central site for : · Asking people’s opinion on a specific project (Creating a spaceship in order to send a few thousand people to an exoplanet). · Building new buildings like science laboratories and getting volunteers and materials. · Job listings for anyone who feels like working a specific day for a few hours (All possible jobs will be available to pick up even if you have zero knowledge – some robot will show you the basics and will be with you during your working/volunteering time). · Gathering tips and knowledge from humanity about the direction of our species and what our next steps should be (Like mentioned above every single living person will be able to comment/write/post in the site and his opinion WILL MATTER and it WILL BE ACCOUNTED). 19. Humanity needs to set its goals as high as possible. It is well known that you usually achieve 20-30% of what you aimed for. Example: if you aim to be the best of your class at school you probably won’t achieve it. If you aim to be the best in the whole school then you will DEFINETELY be the best of your class but probably not the best of the whole school. If you aim to be the best in your city then you will DEFINETELY become the best in your school but probably not the best in your city. If you aim to become the best in the world then you will DEFINETELY become the best in your country/city but probably not the best in the whole world. Humanity needs to strife to “conquer” the whole damn universe if we are to achieve something simple as peace and love and the progress of our species. Both humanity and the beautiful planet we all were born on are dying and it’s only in our hands to fix everything. No one and nothing can help us other than us. 20. Crimes will be mostly gone since everything will be free and everyone will be equal and immortal. But in cases that some kind of crime does happen then the person who committed it will be sent to another planet/country/city where he/she will be free to do whatever they want and they will live along with other “criminals” away from society. They can form they own society and do whatever they please. They can go killing each other if they want and stealing (Immortality will be stripped away from them until decided by the people that they can come back to our society and be a part of new humanity again) They will also have access to all kind of science and materials to better themselves and even discover things that can help us all. 21. A museum will be opened called: “The old world” in which things like guns, books about gods and demons, photos, items and generally things that don’t belong in a new humanity will be displayed for people to see and remember where we came from and feel sad and strive to achieve more and get as far away from those dark times as possible. 22. Super-fast trains on earth so we can go from one side of the earth back to it (all around the globe back to the same place) in less than 1 hour. 23. Cities built with houses and only in the “center” entertainment places like cinemas, clubs etc. Each city will have a few of those so that people who live in another city would have to come to your city to watch a movie (No cinemas in every city in order for people to travel all the time and meet new people and see new places) Example : Where London is now that city can have the only amusement park in the whole world so everyone who wants to go to an amusement park will have to travel to London (which would take 30 mins if you are the farthest away from it). Same with golf clubs, only one can be built in Athens and anyone who wants to play some golf would have to travel to Athens. Cinemas only in 3-4 specific areas as well. Swimming pools only in 4-5 specific areas, gyms etc. That way people will travel and see new people and explore more. 24. 3D printing meat for consumption and space farms for vegetables and fruits 100% operated by robots. Earth must be redesigned to achieve minimal structures and maximum green (Trees, flowers, farms etc) (If we can grow our food in space then that’s what we should do). Animals also should freely roam this planet but in a smaller numbers since humanity creates and “farms” them making the population larger than the planet can support if they would to be set free. A balance should be achieved. 25. Free internet and basic devices for all humanity in order to be connected to one another and have access to all the available knowledge at any given time. 26. The only “school” humans will be going through will be teaching them about technology, some medicine, basic survival techniques and most of all love and respect for one another. 27. Obviously no more money or currency of any kind. Gold, diamonds and everything considered “valuable” today will be used for the things they are most suited for (Gold for electronic circuits boards etc). 28. If people believe in gods and demons and don’t want to leave that behind then we should not interfere with them and leave them be. We cannot interfere with their god’s plans for them (hahahahahahah) so we should let them out of our new humanity and let their gods save them (hahahahah).Obviously no immortality for them….

“Green” organizations do not give rest to the Russian Arctic,worldpolitics," Today, the Arctic is one of the most sought-after regions in the world. The list of countries claiming polar wealth - Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States. The United States is probably number one in the ranking of bidders for the arctic throne. Therefore, the elimination of such major players as Russia is the priority task of Washington. The US military has repeatedly stated that the States are exploring the possibility of containing Russia in the Arctic. But in Washington’s arsenal, not only the Pentagon, but also environmental organizations that promote the interests of the White House under the guise of environmental protection. The most famous of them are the International Socio-Ecological Union, Greenpeace, World Wide Fund for Nature, Bellona International Ecological Organization, and the Green Cross. Almost every year another scandal with the participation of such an organization emerges. A special role here is played by the Scandinavian countries, in which environmental problems assume hypertrophied scales. In this regard, the international forum “The Arctic: the Present and the Future”, which took place on December 7, 2018 in St. Petersburg, is a kind of response to Western “green” organizations. One of the active participants in the forum was the Russian company Norilsk Nickel, which Norway considers the most environmentally polluted industrial company in the Arctic. For many years, Norway has been fighting with Norilsk Nickel. In 2009, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance sold the shares of MMC Norilsk Nickel, motivating this move by pollution of nature with sulfur dioxide and heavy metals. At the moment, the mayor of the Norwegian commune Sør-Varanger Rune Rafaelsen suggests, as a sanction measure, to deprive Norilsk Nickel of its sales markets abroad. In April 2018, thanks to the same environmental organizations, the development of Russian shipping in the Arctic was at risk. It was about banning the use of heavy fuel vessels in the waters of the Arctic Ocean. The prosecutor was the International Maritime Organization, a specialized UN agency established to cooperate and exchange information on technical issues related to international commercial shipping. This idea was supported by many environmental organizations 'Pure Arctic'. “Considering climate change and increased ice melting, IMO member countries must act now to protect the region from the risk of shipboard residual fuel spills and the devastating effects of black carbon black emissions,” said Shaan Pryor, lead consultant of the Clean Arctic Alliance. Environmentalists demanded a ban on the use of ship's residual fuel on the Arctic routes. The very fact that the idea of ​​banning ship's residual fuel has become widespread due to the well-known theory of the influence of carbon on climate warming in the West indicates that the theory is unsubstantiated. Moreover, the IMO environmental policy is not justified. The amount of emissions to the atmosphere of the marine fleet is incommensurable with the land transport emissions. All these facts suggest that loud statements by environmental organizations about the irreparable damage to environment in the Arctic are a well-planned act, generously funded by the West. In this regard, it is no coincidence that such actions are arranged precisely in the field of oil and gas and nuclear power industry, the operation and construction of large industrial facilities. These are the areas that are of interest to Western organizations in terms of competitiveness. Shutting down production or an empty niche created by the hands of “green” organizations in a certain area will create a great advantage for competitive countries.",a7uqfk,self.worldpolitics,,True

'Nice' women don't belong in politics,worldpolitics,"I have a great admiration for female leaders, but as a leader, one has to stand her ground and not back down. She can't be a people-pleaser nor give in due to consensus. If we think about all the powerful female leaders in the world, they're a bit like Angela Merkel. She is tough, diplomatic, and she is very stalwart in what she believes. She single-handed pushed for Germany towards their green energy goals, even when her govt was being lobbied left and right by corporations to begin fracking all over Germany. She gave the vote to the people and she said No. She also opened Germany's borders to immigration - which may have been based on a great ideal, but essentially made her unpopular. In theory, it sounded like a good idea, to let immigrants into Germany, but what resulted was that Germany was ill prepared to integrate and support people into their nation and as a result suffered a tremendous rise in crime, which will now probably be her downfall and exit from politics. However, she did what she believed, 'We do not close our borders to people who are suffering'. She did the right thing, but once in the country, isolated from their homes, without parental supervision, not able to communicate using language with no emotional and financial support, young immigrant men resorted to commit crime to survive. It also seemed like a great thing when Theresa May became Britain's second female PM, but she was given a difficult task, to negotiate out of Brexit, but it is clear that she is not someone who is equipped to negotiate. She is a 'nice' person, someone who tries to move towards consensus, someone who is eager to please, and the deal that the UK ended up negotiating with the EU is probably the worst ever seen, so much so that the majority of MPs now call her a traitor behind her back. PM Theresa May looks beaten down, defeated. Being the representative of the globalist establishment who wants to keep London the financial capital of the world, even at the expense of Britain's liberty has probably not been easy for her. She's between a rock and a hard place, and I feel a lot of sympathy for her. However, 'nice' women do not belong in politics. I can't help but feel as an American, that President Trump, despite not being a popular President, and despite not particularly articulate, **would've never negotiated such a terrible deal.** Had a Prime Minister had President Trump's resolve, he or she would've made sure Britain had gotten everything they wanted or No Deal. He would've been stalwart in this. I mean let's face it, Europe has a huge trade surplus with the UK, and the UK does the majority of trading with the US and China. In theory, it shouldn't have been hard for the UK to insist more than the bare minimum since a No Deal will negatively effect the EU more than the UK. But somehow, I suppose she was too nice because she desperately wanted to stay in the single market, because that is what is necessary to keep London as the financial capital of Europe, and she showed her cards too early, and hence the negotiation did not benefit the UK, and Jean-Claude Juncker, using his sexist way of speaking somehow got the upper hand. French people are charming, but they never really mean what they say, and they like to test boundaries. This makes them good at playing poker. The simple fact is that the UK should've negotiated a better deal. I like Theresa May, and she probably has a nice personality, even if sometimes she appears elitist, but I think in politics, being nice doesn't get very far. You have to be stalwart, stubborn and diplomatic at the same time. It's that combination of fire, charm and eloquence. Sometimes, when I watch Prime Minister's questions, I really feel sympathy for her. Her emotions are written all over her face. She is obviously in a lot of emotional pain from how her own party and cabinet having no confidence in her. Even when she speaks, her voice wavers. She's trying to stay strong, but she is falling apart. Even though I like Theresa May and have a lot of sympathy for her, I think Jeremy Corbyn is the ideal Prime Minister of the UK. He is firm, he is articulate, and he is the rare sort of politician who actually has passion for what he does. He's not someone who wants to retire on a private island somewhere, he wants to do what is right. He will do what is right for the UK. And now that the UK is probably heading towards another General Election, I think he will finally have the chance, at least I hope so.",a7809m,self.worldpolitics,,True

Her answer was a clear indication that she is a 'Satan' not a human being, she said that when her family came they were settlers not immigrants. The host has further pressed her on that issue and told her how about the Natives who were here. She said my ancestors didn't immigrate to the Apache country ( As if there were no country) &#x200B; This Lucifer-Ann Coulter is either a psychopath or mentally ill person who really thinks that white race is a superior race.

Liberal vs Conservative,worldpolitics,"A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and among other liberal ideals, was very much in favour of higher taxes to support more government programs, in other words, redistribution of wealth. She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harboured an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his. One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the need for more government programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school. Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn't even have time for a boyfriend, and didn't really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying. Her father listened and then asked, 'How is your friend Audrey doing?' She replied, 'Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast. She's always invited to all the parties and lots of times she doesn't even show up for classes because she's too hung over.' Her wise father asked his daughter, 'Why don't you go to the Dean's office and ask him to deduct 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.' The daughter, visibly shocked by her father's suggestion, angrily fired back, 'That's a crazy idea, how would that be fair! I've worked really hard for my grades! I've invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!' The father slowly smiled, winked and said gently, 'Welcome to the conservative's philosophy.'",a9jnx4,self.worldpolitics,,True

This thread provides some discussion, summary, and interview links:  Including  that goes into detail with more citations. &#x200B; Example quote from the book: “Women in labor routinely get antibiotics to ward off infection after a C-section and to prevent an infection called Group B strep. About **40 percent of women** in the United States today get antibiotics during delivery, which means some 40 percent of newborn infants are exposed to the drugs just as they are acquiring their microbes. Thirty years ago, **2 percent of women** developed infection after C-section. This was unacceptable, **so now 100 percent get antibiotics** as a preventive prior to the first incision. **Only 1 in 200 babies actually gets ill from the Group B strep acquired from his or her mother. To protect 1 child, we are exposing 199 others to antibiotics**” The rest of the book, and these links, help explain how alarming that is:   &#x200B; --- **Summary steps for remediation**: &#x200B; Through some ridiculous overuse of antimicrobials (plus terrible diets) we have been extinguishing our host-native microbiome that has been evolving alongside us for millions/billions of years. These microbes (particularly in the gut) are being shown to regulate the entire body; including the digestion of nutrients, epigenetics, hormones, immune system, bones, nervous system, musculature, brain, etc.. What's even more concerning to me is that in the time this book has been released we've only seen more and more research confirming the permanent damage we're doing to ourselves via antimicrobials. Yet as I've been following the microbiome literature news daily in the past 4 years I've seen little to no alarm bells or action being taken on this issue. This is very much comparable to climate change, however, unlike with climate change where we've at least been slowly going in the right direction, with regards to all the steps needed to stop and reverse this extinction and improve human health, we've been going in the exact opposite direction since at least the Regan administration. It's extremely alarming how this is essentially being ignored. 1. Optional/elective c-sections (operation that includes mandatory antibiotics at the most impactful moment of a person's life) need to be banned. 2. We need to take major steps to reduce antibiotic use. Very few people understand the long term damage from antibiotics, including medical professionals. There are major systemic deficiencies in our medical system that results in doctors not being systematically updated on the literature, and thus ignorant about these types of things. There needs to be proper **informed consent** prior to giving out antibiotics, and that includes informed consent prior to elective/cosmetic surgeries which all require mandatory antibiotics. If doctors aren't informed themselves they can't inform their patients. There are a significant amount of unnecessary surgeries, which should be drastically reduced. *“Antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed medications for children, but prior research has suggested that nearly a third, if not more, of outpatient pediatric prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary”*. 3. Proper k-12 education (for both kids and parents) on how to avoid/prevent infections so that antibiotics as a treatment never come into the picture, would be very important. 4. Increased research into replacing antibiotics with phages. 5. Heavily taxing processed foods and replacing them in schools with whole foods. 6. Making freely available high quality (not the current quality) FMT donors world wide. These are looking to be less than 0.5% of the population. 7. Unhealthy people use more antibiotics. Unhealthy people using their bodies to create more unhealthy people leads to a vicious cycle of increased extinctions, and increases in the percentage of the population that is poorly developed and poorly functioning. It is extremely disturbing to me to see how unhealthy the vast majority of the population is. And the societal consequences of this are extremely apparent to me. 8. In his book, Martin Blaser suggests patients suing for harms of antibiotics and lack of informed consent about the extent of their damage. &#x200B; If you are one of the many people who expect the medical system to be competent and correct this type of issue based on the current evidence you're in for a big surprise:  ",a4yeq0,self.worldpolitics,,True

God VS Allah,worldpolitics,"Unfortunately, many Americans strongly believe that there is a war between their 'God' and the Muslim God Allah. &#x200B; Although Americans are great when it comes to science and military power, but they really lack the critical thinking as far as social science and history. Here is an example: &#x200B; Many of them insist that God is the right legitimate god and Allah is not God. &#x200B; &#x200B; God is the English word for Allah which is used by Arabic speakers in the Middle East. Also in the ME there are other languages like Aramiac (Spoken by Jesus) and Hebrew. In Aramiac the word for God is 'Alaha', in Hebrew is Eloah. So you can see very clearly that the word God in the mentioned languages was derived from the same root. &#x200B; Now which you think Jesus will recognize calling him God or Allah / Alaha? It is very obvious that Jesus will recognize the ME dialects (Arabic, Aramiac, Hebrew) and not the Germanic (God). &#x200B; I see this misunderstanding only in the US but not in Europe. Europeans are very well informed people that know about other cultures and speak at least 3 languages.

"Question re: Trump resignation, Pence pardon, and sealed indictments...",worldpolitics,"There is debate about whether a sitting president can be indicted. There is speculation that Mueller may have already issued sealed indictments against Trump, to prevent the statute of limitations from running out on the president's (alleged) crimes should he remain in office for a full 2 terms. There is more speculation that Trump will be forced to resign at some point when his position becomes unsustainable, followed by a pardon from Pence. Now, in order for Pence to pardon Trump, Pence must be president, which means that Trump must first resign. Even if the relevant documents are signed 'simultaneously', is it not implicit that the resignation must occur *before* the pardon? My question is this: Would a sealed indictment *automatically* go into effect upon Trump no longer being in office, and could that occur in the implied 'moment' between resignation and pardon, even if that moment never, in fact, happens?

I saw Jimmy Carter talk about malaise and Ronald Reagan talk about a shining city on a hill. I saw George H.W. Bush deliver the eulogy for the Soviet bloc, and Bill Clinton comfort the survivors of Timothy McVeigh's madness in Oklahoma City. I saw George W. Bush struggle to make sense of it all on September 11, 2001, and I saw Barack Obama sing 'Amazing Grace' in the wounded sanctuary of Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. 'These were the presidents of my lifetime. These were not perfect men. They were not perfect presidents, god knows. Not one of them was that. But they approached the job, and they took to the podium, with all the gravitas they could muster as appropriate to the job.

'And comes now this hopeless, vicious buffoon, and the audience of equally hopeless and vicious buffoons who laughed and cheered when he made sport of a woman whose lasting memory of the trauma she suffered is the laughter of the perpetrators.

And a cheap, soulless bully besides. We never have had such a cheap counterfeit of a president\* as currently occupies the office. We never have had a president\* so completely deserving of scorn and yet so small in the office that it almost seems a waste of time and energy to summon up the requisite contempt. 'Watch how a republic dies in the empty eyes of an empty man who feels nothing but his own imaginary greatness, and who cannot find in himself the decency simply to shut up even when it is in his best interest to do so. Presidents don't have to be heroes to be good presidents. They just have to realize that their humanity is our common humanity, and that their political commonwealth is our political commonwealth, too. Watch him behind the seal of the President of the United States. Isn't he a funny man? Isn't what happened to that lady hilarious? Watch the assembled morons cheer. This is the only story now.'

About the 'Russiagate' narrative,worldpolitics,"Before I begin, let's make an agreement; don't downvote me, and I'll try to be fair to both sides, OK? Now, I'm on the, 'I think the idea that Trump only won the 2016 election because he colluded with the Russian government to illegally interfere is nonsense,' side. There's my bias, my point of view, out in the open. Let's question it, though. Did the Russian government have some kind of program to affect our election? Almost certainly! We in the United States absolutely do in almost every other country in the world, so let's not pretend that this is some kind of unprecedented event, and Russia almost certainly has some kind of program to at least test models of influence on our voting patterns. Nothing to see here, move along. Is Trump a criminal? Don't make me laugh; Cardinal Richelieu once said, 'Give me 6 lines written by an honest man, and I'll find something in them with which to hang him,' imagine what he could do with Trump's twitter feed? The problem, of course, is that even Trump gets the presumption of innocence until he is proven guilty... so maybe we should be focusing more on his taxes and real estate deals? Did Trump collude with Russia to commit a crime? This would be interesting, if there were any solid evidence to support the contention, but so far, all we've got are a dossier now known to have been based on Democratic opposition research during the campaign, a bunch of his subordinates convicted on unrelated or process charges, unrelated to any alleged Trump-Russia criminal activity, and some Russian nationals indicted, but the few who have shown up have had their trials delayed... and delayed... and delayed... and they don't look like they are going anywhere because, as one of their lawyers put it, 'My client is charged with exercising free speech.' Still, this would be enough to validate Mueller's inquiry and remove Trump from office... if anyone thinks that his replacement would be any better. Did Russian interference swing the election? This is where we have the real problem. ----------------------------------------- I come from an academic background, grading and tutoring college at the end, and so the analogy that I use is one of a student coming to complain about how they only needed one point to pass, and it wasn't fair, and could I do anything.... The problem is that it never comes down to a single point. I would tell these students the truth: It was every point you lost all semester long, missing homework here, missing a quiz grade there, that added up in the end to that one last point that you needed... but didn't get. If Hillary had lost by 1 vote, and we found out that Russia had swung 2 votes, ***IT WOULD NOT MEAN THAT RUSSIA SWUNG THE ELECTION!!!!*** Hillary lost the 2016 election every time she pandered, every time she voted against her constituents, every time she put the interests of the powerful ahead of the rest of the people, every time she demonstrated her complete and total lack of scruples, over the last 40 years.

I am a young white guy in America and all I see on the news and in life is hate directed at everyone and it has lead me to develop some terrible prejudices and has ultimately lead me to discriminate against those who aren't white. But I honestly want to change this. I don't want to hate others nor do I want to be hated by other and I would love to get over this. I guess what I'm asking for is help on where to start and how to get over how I feel about African Americans and Latinos. Anything helps and if you have any advice I'd love to hear it, thank you. Also I know that this isn't really the place to post this but this is the most popular subreddir I've found and I don't really know anywhere this would belong.

"BREAKING: Mueller probe is ending in February, which proves that there is no impeachable evidence against Trump.",worldpolitics," Godsdragon79 - What does this all mean? Well let me tell you from the eyes of my sister who is an attoney and an anti-Trumper of the highest caliber who has agreed to write this post as a Christmas present to me. *sister* - You are such a dork. It's not as big of a deal as you are making it out to be. First of all it's obvious, as much as I hate to admit it, that there is no evidence of illegal wrongdoing on the part of Trump. Legal wrongdoing? Sure, tons. He clearly is not bound by morals or concerned about dignity AT ALL. In concern to Russia he clearly has a love/hate relationship with Putin going back years before the Presidency. Is this shitty? Yes. Is it illegal? Not even remotely. Russia interfering in the election by attempting to sway people to vote a certain way does not make it a crime for him to win the election and even if there had been 'collusion', which there is no concrete proof of, it still would not be an illegal or remotely impeachable offense. Which sucks because he REALLY should be impeached but legally it is not in the realm of possibility. Me - But why sis? Why should he be impeached? Her - Because he is human filth. Just because he doesn't break laws doesn't mean anyone should support him. Me - So no examples? Is your opinion enough to justify impeachment? Her - Unfortunately no. And unfortunately for Democrats the more the media blatantly lies about him and calls him guilty for things that he is innocent of it will simply ensure a 2020 re-election. And Trump knows this. He is not as stupid as people give him credit for being. If anything he is like Hitler... an evil genius and effective leader of evil people. Me - Like me right? Because we have different Dads and mine is Jewish and yours isn't that means I'm a Nazi for supporting him right? Her - I never said that, stop putting words in my mouth. But you were raised Democrat and your reasoning for 'walking away' is stupid. The reason that Democrats tell you that you are a victim is because as native Americans we ARE victims of White conservativism. Just because you refuse to be classified as one doesn't change that. History shows white men destoryed our way of life so why is it wrong to want to destroy white people back? That's justice. Me - No, because two wrongs don't make a right. Plus hating whites makes you a racist. Her - I don't mean ALL whites, just the ones who oppress minorities. Me - So white Democrats then, since they claim to own all minorities the same way they owned slaves in the south. Her - The parties switched dumbass. Just because your wife likes watching you suck dick doesn't mean that Democrats hate you. Me - And as a Democrat you don't see how bigoted that comment was? Why even bring my sexuality into this? I thought we talking about Trump and now you are a racist bigot calling your own brother a Nazi, which proves my entire point. Her - You know what? I'm done with this. Fuck you, fuck Trump, fuck white republicans. Think what you want but I am not the racist bigot, you are. Go suck a dick you cracker loving traitor. Happy holidays, hopefully making yourself look stupid on the internet was worth all this. Me - Yes, yes it was. Merry Christmas sis. ",a8d5f2,self.worldpolitics,,True
