Part 4 : OpenBazaar And Institution - Open Letter no.2,Libertarian," This is the second open letter to readers of my articles and the first open letter published on November 26. Those who possibly found the first letter disturbing. Those who thought to themselves, outright, it was wrong. Before posting my first letter I paused for a while, I was about to create an image of myself which would last forever. Then I thought I wasn’t creating anything. That’s who I am. Normally it’s not good that exposing who you really are, damages you, but that’s how things are. The aim of my articles was to encourage debates on topics relevant to the whole world. But I understand that the real me is on the way. So I decided to write this letter. In such an interconnected, complex world we live in, no individual, no single idea can save the world. Put aside, individuals. Ideas should be discussed, rejected, developed and transformed. Ideas which have been developed collectively will lead to lasting social reforms. Ignore individuals. Ignore their mistakes, their misjudgments. Let the debate begin. For a long time prison for me was something to be forgotten. It took years to realize the opposite was true. The lesson was in fact far too valuable to be forgotten. Some months ago I noticed that Mr Gauke, UK Secretary for Justice had expressed his intentions for prison reform. As a person who had experienced life on both sides of prison doors, I thought it was time to bring the topic to the foreground. Mr Gauke had mentioned reforming one side of the prison doors. There are, in fact, two sides to each door and both sides of prison doors need reform. And it’s not limited to the UK. Global problems need global solutions. For me, civil disobedience wasn’t an easy choice. I wouldn’t do that if I hadn’t clearly and firmly rejected violent solutions and protests in my previous articles. Then protests in France began. It wasn’t entirely peaceful and it achieved as much as protests in this kind could achieve: A few laws were overturned. And it urged me to write this letter to make it clear that no profound reform is ever achieved by violence. No violent solution exists for global problems our world faces. We need no more destruction. Destruction, of the environment and global stability among other things, are being done on a daily basis. Construction, however, based on global collaboration is the solution. And lastly, I should apologize to those who found my first letter disturbing. I posted that for what I believed to be a good cause, globally. &#x200B; This is the link to other articles : ",a6e0en,self.Libertarian,,True

LIBERTARIANS ARE BEING SILENCED!!! JOIN OUR DISCORD FOR MORE INFO!!!,Libertarian,[removed],ab4cia,self.Libertarian,,True
New /r/Libertarian Rules,Libertarian,"Hello, /r/Libertarian. We are implementing a massive overhaul of the existing rules system. There are many reasons for this. The rules go into effect immediately after this post is made into an announcement. Most of you, especially those who have been posting in communities with similar rulesets, might want to rejoice! These rules ultimately mean that the subreddit will have significant improvements in quality, a better signal-to-noise ratio, and won't get banned by the Reddit admins. These rules were edited as all the moderators as a group, and we've all agreed that these rules would be acceptable. That includes people like /u/JobDestroyer and /u/Properal, who moderate /r/GoldAndBlack which has a stricter ruleset than these, as well as people like /u/Z3f, who moderates /r/Anarcho_Capitalism, which has a much looser ruleset than these. This also includes the members of the moderation team who invited in the new moderators. These rules should not majorly impact average users and libertarians in any major way. These rules are targetted at reducing the number of trolls and reddiquette violations on the sub, as well as making it simply a more pleasant place to post, as well as to defend the libertarian brand from political opponents who would like to see libertarianism unsuccessful, such as the communists who recently brigaded the subreddit. To understand where the moderator team is coming from, first I recommend this article from LessWrong. Read it, and ask yourself, 'Does this sound like /r/Libertarian?' ' With these rulesets, we intend to improve the quality of discussion on the subreddit by getting rid of the worst posters and thus allowing the best posters the ability to thrive and discuss without getting a headache wading through crap. The less bad posters, the more good posters there are proportionally. The more good posters there are proportionally, the better this subreddit can serve in introducing the ideas of libertarianism to people who are new and curious. The better this subreddit does in introducing the ideas of libertarianism to people who are new and curious, the more libertarians we get in the world. The more libertarians we get in the world, the more gooder. So now, without further ado, here's the actual rules themselves: #1 The Golden Rule 'Do unto others, as you would have others do unto you.' It has worked for a long time. If you want respect, show it to others. Be excellent to each other:  #2 The No Troll Rule Troll behavior will not be tolerated. Details below. None of these behaviors are necessary to communicate ideas. Prohibiting these troll behaviors in this subreddit will allow people to be more open with ideas and share their experiences and ideas with the community. This is not a safe space. Even civil discussions may touch on topics that offend you. You feeling offended is not grounds for moderation of others. ###2.1 Flaming Flamebaiting Flaming that is grossly offensive will be removed. This includes overtly racist images, involuntary porn images, and shock comments. It also includes accusing someone of racism or sexism because they were insensitive rather than overtly racist (i.e. SJW antics). Do not publicly complain about /r/Libertarian moderation by posting to this subreddit. If you think a post or comment should be moderated click report. If you disagree on moderation use the 'message the moderators' link on the sidebar to message the moderation team, don't start a flame war over moderation. ###2.2 Threats and Calls for Violence Threats and Calls for Violence are already covered in Reddit Content Policy and as such are strictly prohibited. . ###2.3 Concern trolling Concern trolling is when a person pretends to be a libertarian for the purposes of confusing people about what a libertarian is. This includes people who are proponents of communism, and other extremist ideologies, stating that their viewpoints are libertarian. This confuses the topic; this subreddit is for regular libertarians, not 18th century French communists. Dashboards are not called 'instrument panels' even though they no longer stop splashing mud from the 'dashing hooves of horses' from hitting the passengers. Language changes over time. Ancoms/antifa/libsocs, whatever they self-identify as, are not libertarians. When they participate, they are guests. They must act in good faith. #3 Off Topic Posts Comments Off topic posts unrelated to libertarianism, markets, politics, currents events, etc. are discouraged and may be removed. #General Rule clarification ###Opposing views Sincere questions about libertarianism are welcome. Posts solely about other ideologies, however, are considered off-topic and may be removed. You may reduce the chance of a post being removed by giving some indication how it relates to libertarianism. Comments sincerely critiquing posts or comments are also welcome. We ask the r/Libertarian community not to downvote comments or post just because you disagree. Please reserve downvotes for off-topic content and trolling. If you disagree with a post or comment please leave a comment explaining why rather than downvote. If someone is trolling please don’t troll back. Don't feed the trolls is perhaps the Internet's oldest maxim. **Please disengage and report trolling.** ###A note on bans Users come to /r/Libertarian expecting good discussion. Any user with obvious patterns of trolling may be banned even if the trolling is only in other subreddits. Trolling is defined in our rules. Brand new accounts or lightly used accounts that are highly suspected to be sockpuppets and spam bots may be limited or banned. Trolling usernames may be banned as well. Spammers and spam bots will be banned immediately. If you feel you were banned in error, a polite note will fix a mistake long before a profanity-laced modmail will. Lets us know if you think we made a mistake. ###Please Make the Mods Job Easier Moderation is a volunteer job, yet can be time-consuming. Please report posts or comments that break the rules, this helps greatly. Moderators may leave borderline content unmoderated and let voting take care of it, or they may remove it. The moderators of this subreddit may not always give a reason for a moderation action or inaction. If you have been banned or have posts caught in the spam filter and you feel you can provide and positive contribution to the subreddit, message the moderators. Our moderation team are all volunteers, so they may be busy with their lives. It may take time for them to respond, so please remain patient. Also, if your account has an obvious pattern of trolling, the moderators may not waste time responding to you. If you are sincere you are welcome to send repeat messages if you did not get a response to remind the mods to respond. The moderator may be discussing your predicament in mod mail where you can’t see. It may take time for them to come to an agreement. Please be patient. ###Participation in the subreddit is a privilege and not a right The mods of /r/Libertarian are cultivating the community of /r/Libertarian for the purpose of promoting libertarianism and promoting a culture of liberty on Reddit. Your participation in /r/Libertarian rests on convincing the mods that you can make a positive contribution towards those goals. The mods of /r/Libertarian do not owe you a soapbox. You are welcome to get your own soapbox, use other subreddits, start your own subreddit, or start your own forum platform. Think of /r/Libertarian as an open but privately owned theme park or piazza. We reserve right to remove any user for any reason.",a4i7vy,self.Libertarian,,True

Could we soon see a solidified libertarian show emerge on the biggest network yet? Maybe someone like Ron Paul's liberty report, or Dave Rubin's youtube show even though he doesn't consider himself libertarian. I know Austin Petersen and Larry Sharpe are trying to get into podcasts and other media stuff to get their name out for next elections. Maybe they could get a show.

Just a quick idea...,Libertarian,"I was reading the comments in the post about Rand Paul. Someone suggested a 1:1 ratio for state to Fed tax contributions... So if Louisiana citizens split dollar for dollar between the two institutionalized gangs. Then someone brought up the point of distribution of centralized funds. This went on and on, and it got me thinking. &#x200B; What if our federal government and its agencies became ala carte? &#x200B; So say Idaho sees no reason to be hooked into paying for flood protection and hurricane protection. The state government of Idaho would simply not purchase that plan from the fed. What if, in fact, all of these ala carte options were presented on a 'menu' to state government every, say, five years. At the end of that five year term, the coverage by those options would expire (except for certain circumstances), and would have to be either renewed, amended, or canceled. If Washington state or California wishes to be all socialist and lefty, they can buy the whole package. If Louisiana or Texas wishes to have certain protections, but not all of the oversight crap, they have options. If South Carolina and Kentucky don't want the Federal Government to darken their towels again, they have that option as well. &#x200B; Essentially, other than in cases of the Commerce clause, the tenth amendment is in full, literal force. Commerce Clause: >' \[The Congress shall have Power\] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;' &#x200B; Tenth Amendment: >'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' &#x200B; Honestly, I don't know how this could be implemented.

These people aren't considered libertarians. They might be considered principled constitutionalists, the same way as people who worry about the 'imperial presidency' and its use of executive orders.

My Libertarian Candidate just won the 5Th District Supervisor in Riverside County. Ca.

Cannabis is legal recreationally in California. But this new Ordinance for all intents and purposes make cannabis illegal commercially. Except if you are one of 50 people a year selected. The new rules are-— You must grow inside an industrial building , on Industrial zoned land, be a multimillionaire, agree to a very expensive developers agreement. The new rules are endless , they just go on and on. Ignoring all the expensive monthly electrical requirements and green house gases involved in growing an outdoor plant indoors. The County has it All backwards. We have 2.4 million people in Our County. The selected 50 people out of 2.4 million residents equals = 1 in / 48,000 applicants Get a Cannabis Grow permit, no one else. 50 was an arbitrary number picked ignoring all the demand. 99% of the people that wanted a grow permit, were ignored. Thousands of people wanted Outdoor Commercial Cannabis Permits. Only 50 permits are offered/ yearly. ( All indoor grows only) Most all of these people were zoned Agricultural but #348 excludes almost all zonings. In the Unincorporated County over 30 Zones were excluded in #348. If you grow too many Cannabis plants expect a visit from your local police. And expect to be prosecuted by the Courts to fullest extent of Ordinance # 348. — Ordinance #348 is a total denial of all our Agricultural Lands and zonings by the Riverside County Supervisors. Anybody with Ag land and more than five acres should be able grow an Acre of Cannabis Outside as per current California State Law on the books. The Riverside County, Ca. Supervisors have stripped thousands of California State Residents of their Agricultural Rights because they don’t like Cannabis. This is not right, in fact it’s wrong. Flat out wrong.

Government In Action: Envy Plates,Libertarian,"This tale of bureaucracy and competence comes to us from best-of-craigslist: 50 parking violations. All different Makes. All different colors. So I was new to California Along with a blonde hair cut convertible, I decide to get some personalized plates. I could not believe my luck, when I found out that my initials 'NV' (ph. 'envy') are available. Not that I think anyone would be envious of me in my Miata, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. You are probably thinking that custom plates are like bug lights to The Man. Not as far as I can tell. I got pulled over just as infrequently considering how I drive, but my accent and impeccable record kept me in the good books. So then, I start to get random parking tickets from Los Angeles. Where my car has never been. For every type of car. Except a Mazda. Which is what I drive. No problem, right? Just call them up, deal with a healthy level of skepticism when I tell them the ticket isn't mine... no really. I would ask them what make color the ticket is for. I would ask them what make color my car is. Even a highly skeptical city clerk can't argue with that. Then the notices of unpaid violations slowly start to come in from all over California. Because when the license plate is Not Visible, the charming traffic wardens enter 'NV' as the license plate. So I figure they will soon fix the training issue and stop bugging me with tickets. Then the city of Oakland has some computer upgrade. The first day I get five tickets. The next day... three. And they kept on sending them. For every type of car imaginable including BMW's and Porsches, every car imaginable, except for a white two door Mazda. Now I know what you are thinking, BMW's don’t park in Oakland. I was surprised too. But more than that, I was tired of sitting on hold for twenty minutes, waiting to talk to a skeptical city employee. So I returned the custom plates to the DMV, and someone at Oakland told me that all fifty tickets would be put under administrative review. Problem solved? Not even. First, the DMV refused to issue me my registration, until I got a piece of paper saying I was not guilty. Then I received a notice that the Franchise Tax Board wanted to garnish my wages. Not with cilantro either. Now I have a notice stating that any tax refund I get will be going to the City of Oakland. So now i am feeling a little irate. And a little wiser. I tried calling my local police department, to see if there is a bench warrant out for my arrest. The friendly officer told me that I would have to come to the office... in person. And I swear, she said this with what sounded like a straight face. As a last resort, I decided to post here. You never know. Someone might want a collection of over fifty parking violations from seven different counties for all different makes and models. $3000, and they are all yours. Call it abstract art or something. The only thing that makes me feel a little better, is that the lovely folks at Oakland tell me someone driving a BMW now has the license plates 'NV'. Give him a wave if you see him. Tell him you work for the City of Oakland in the traffic violations department. See if he goes green. You know, from envy. NV. ",a35eg2,self.Libertarian,,True

A few little changes...,Libertarian,"Hello all. The following are a few little rule changes I would make if someone gave me the shiny hat of overlordship for a day. Curious what you all would make of them... 1) 'Ignorance of the law is no excuse' and the necessity of a Bar exam to practice law are fundementaly contradictory. I would prefer laws to be simple so I can defend myself without expensive help, so guess which I would prefer. 2) Laws should not be encrypted or convoluted beyond the minimum required by the natural complexity of life in society. Therefore all laws should be given in the simplest language that accomplishes their purpose. 3) laws should each be given the dignity of existing independantly. No more 800 page acts. One effect, one law. Laws requiring complexity can have modifying laws attached, but each one should be as simple as possible. Example 1) don't kill people. 1A) you may defend yourself with lethal force if attacked. 1B) you can use lethal force to defend another person who is attacked. Ect. Yes each word would be argued about, but that argument would be more constructive than 800 page no one read it stuff. 4) I would hope that there would be a tight loop between judges and lawmakers so if a law was having a nasty, unwanted side effect the judges would delay the case(s), congress would argue until they reached an accord and the law would be permenently rewritten so everyone would be able to adjust, rather than needing to sift through boxes of case law.

But I just saw an article that he used this trade embargo with China to leverage a deal to force China into making fentanyl a controlled substance in China. That’s a huge move to help addicts, if China holds up their end it could save countless lives. Now the liberal side of me wants to hate Trump but after seeing how he uses trade and economics to fix social issues I’m not sure I’m as skeptical of the man. ",a2lcqy,self.Libertarian,,True
Do y'all like private medical insurance companies?,Libertarian,"More specifically, do you think private insurance companies are better than single payer? I would imagine so, because with them, you're able to say, 'No thanks. I don't want to participate by purchasing your coverage.' And then if you do participate, you know you've made a choice to purchase a product, and were not forced to pay for it in taxes. But ultimately, the more people choose to opt out, the less effective and more expensive insurance becomes for everyone else... until it ultimately doesn't make sense for the insurance company to operate at all. That's the nature of insurance - everyone's premiums go together into one big pool, and claims are paid out to those who need them. By design, a majority of the customers are paying more into the pool than they are getting back, and a minority are getting more back than they are putting in. If you buy insurance, especially as a younger healthier person, you are paying for other people's healthcare. But it just seems to me, from what I know about libertarianism, that it's more the concept of insurance itself that they wouldn't like. With any type of insurance - flood, auto, rental, property title... you are paying for other people's coverage/payouts. You are probably (if you're lucky) paying for something you will never have to use. Lots of liberty minded people (especially capitalists) purchase insurance all the time, for a variety of things. If you own something, you want it insured. I understand that many people like to purchase a coverage package that suits them, paying less in premiums if they don't want as much coverage, but that inherently goes against the notion of insurance. Again, you are not paying for your own coverage. You are part of a group that is paying to cover everyone who needs it. And with healthcare, it doesn't make sense to pay less, and be 'less covered.' As humans, any one of us could get cancer, ten broken bones, two hernias, and a concussion, simultaneously, at any moment. It's unlikely but it's possible. Since most people aren't rich enough to pay for all that, demand exists for insurance, hence it's existence in the market. Given the need for insurance to exist as a product, it makes less sense for there to be many insurance companies with separate money pools, and more sense for there to be one 'single payer' with one big money pool, because that payer is able to bargain with medical providers such as doctors and hospitals (who would still be competing with each other). This would result in the lowest set prices for procedures/medicines, and simplify the system, making it more efficient. Many studies have shown this including one by the Koch brothers, but it's also common sense. The government is also a better candidate to handle this role than private companies. Goldman Sachs recently asked private insurance companies if 'curing people is a sustainable business model.' Insurance companies are in the business of skimming money off the top of their pools. To maximize profits they must deny as many claims as possible, and cover as few 'sick' people as possible. It took Obamacare to prevent them from denying coverage to people with 'pre-existing conditions.' Individuals would still be able to pay their preferred doctors privately, in a direct transaction if they so chose, so it's not like the market would be eliminated by a government-run single payer system. The system would only exist in addition to the market. The only thing that would be eliminated are private insurance companies, which are merely middlemen. There are already entire industries that are not only middleman-free, but completely socialized, such as the police. No libertarians that I know seem to have a problem with that. Imagine if police were not only private workers, but their dispatchers and payers were private companies. Imagine if some of these companies had contracts to work with certain private police officers, but not others within the same municipality. Even if there was a professional code of conduct among all private police and dispatch companies to always help out in emergency situations, then sort out the details and billing later, this would be a horribly inefficient way to fight crime. I don't know anyone who would advocate a system like this. The two best arguments I've heard for keeping private insurance companies around are as follows: 1) Private healthcare companies employ lots of people. Eliminating them would eliminate their jobs. First of all, this is not a libertarian argument. Those people must find some other form of employment. It is no one's responsibility to keep them employed if their jobs are unnecessary. Perhaps they could find work within the government single payer program... or any other industry. 2) I'm rich, and can afford all the healthcare I need by directly paying at a hospital. I don't want to pay taxes that go towards healthcare for other people. This is only true for an extremely wealthy and small portion of the population. If those people feel that they shouldn't have to help the rest of society, and instead want to hoard their wealth, I for one would be fine with a democratically elected government forcing them to do so, and do not feel the need to convince them to do it willingly.",a3a51a,self.Libertarian,,True
Reason #638 Why having mature political discourse in this thread is discouraged.,Libertarian,"Every “ermigawd taxes suck” meme undermines the bigger issue of censorship. Censorship, and banning are literally anti-freedom. Taxation and regulation are conditional discouragement and not full black and white anti-freedom.

Does banning people stop folks from voting in the polls?,Libertarian,"I've been watching this poll drama unfold since it opened and just read up on what happen last night apparently and one of the things I just realized is that I haven't seen answered: Does being banned actually stop people from voting or would they still be able to vote after being banned? Normally I would consider this open and shut, as on most sites a ban negates your access to all parts of the forum\\subforum\\whathavethy but on Reddit a ban really only stops you from Submitting Posts and comments. You can still vote on posts and comments, and I have seen no evidence to suggest those votes aren't still 'live' to so to speak. Given that it seems one of the reasons given for this mass banning was fear that the polls would be used to change the sub. The question that comes to my mind, which is always asking questions, is if this policy would even work. Has any Reddit Administrator or banned individual indicated they can no longer vote on Libertarian polls? If not, this ban streak may not have solved your issue since it could be ages till someone reaches some of the numbers I've see as I saw people with well over 100,000 points. &#x200B; This won't effect me personally either way because I doubt I have any significant amount of points and since I barely post I see no reason why I would ever be important in a weighted vote system that I don't plan to use anyhow. I am however curious since this system could be implemented in some other sub, so its worth asking I think.",a25esd,self.Libertarian,,True

Reality Check,Libertarian,"With this new polling system, I have seen much wailing and gnashing of teeth. I have seen much blaming, disgust, banning, and debate. Debates descending down into argument, and arguments turning into slap-fights. I have enjoyed posting on this forum, there is no doubt. But I will be frank when I say that the blame of this huge disturbance lies squarely on us, and not on admins, far-left or far-right folks, and most certainly not 'brigaders'. Every internet forum has its' troubles. Has times of good and times of bad, times of peace and times of conflict. No forum is exempt, I observed it on BBSes back in the days when telnet was en vogue and instead of putting in a web address you typed in a phone number. What determines the quality of not only a forum, but also its' users, is not its' behaviour in peace, but its' behaviour in conflict. It is tested only when it is tested, and not when things are hunky-dory and everything is alright. We have failed this test. A new system was forced on us by a sysop, so what? It's happened to me dozens of times on dozens of fora! And guess what? Life went on. We noticed that there was a new system, and we adopted, adapted, and improved. The quality and quantity of discourse remained mostly the same, for every good person that left because of the new system or protocol we gained another good person because the new system or protocol made the BBS more attractive to him. The discourse is degenerating on r/Libertarian as I speak. What used to be a place for the discussion of liberty-promoting policy has now devolved into a junior high cafeteria food fight. And to think that the users of this board are treating this food fight as if it is a coup d'etat or like they're being censored by a Marxist dictatorship! A moderator who holds certain opinions is banning those who disagree with him? Oh, boo hoo! Spring child, you are inexperienced! I have been kicked off of forums simply out of fancy. They had no vendetta, they just felt like banning someone, and I happened to be in the right place at the right time. Moderators being dictators is no new thing, and it is quite anomalous that Reddit has been able to mostly stave this phenomena off for so long. Reddit, you are so very **un-believably spoiled** when it comes to having things forced onto you. I've been on fora that have implemented a totally new editing system that just so happened to break the formatting of all previous posts. I've had to change my workflows and ways of doing things many times on some fora. Be thankful the sysops are very hands off here. The biggest change most of Reddit has had to endure is a new interface, and even then they give you an option to revert back. I and many other people have had to endure the switch from one forum software to another, which meant that everything I knew about that forum and its' workings was no longer valid. The complete clearing of moderator teams only to have them replaced with mods that were like cops fresh out of the academy. The addition of rules that were so cumbersome that only an attorney could have reasonably navigated them. And I had no option to revert back. If you're on Reddit, and Reddit matters to you *this much*, you're probably an internet rookie. Take it from a net veteran, this means **nothing**, and if you're so shocked and hurt by something as small as this, you deserved to be shocked and get hurt. Get some balls, take a deep breath, and move on. I've had to abandon many fora because of unacceptable moderation styles rearing their ugly head. And guess what? Most of those fora are shut down. And if you want to put your writing or political ramblings online, for god's sakes do it on your own website that you own, control, and create yourself. It's the only sure-fire way of making sure your writing stays uncut, uncensored, and that your voice stays intact. Putting all your work on a site like Reddit or Facebook is like giving your personal journal that you're still writing in to the New York Public Library. It needn't be a complex web site, the  I know of is black and white with Times New Roman text. If you want to show it off on a forum, post a link to the page with a small excerpt on the forum post to draw people in. ",a28jew,self.Libertarian,,True

"Make no mistake, this community points system is an effort to marginalize all libertarian/decentralized subs",Libertarian,"Don't buy the bullshit that it's a test of a new administration system, this is very clearly an attempt by the reddit admins (whom regularly purge right-leaning subs) to remove this and bitcoin subs in an unorthodox way. Since this sub has always ran on zero moderation, and since our mods never take a position or stance on any issues, reddit was unable to ban us no matter how hard we got trolled or brigaded. With this new system, that is all gone as polls now decide everything from who gets banned to who can replace existing mods etc. And the worst part is, the number of community points is based on the number of posts and comments that person makes. Not on their upvotes, or anything else, but purely activity. This gives incredible power to the shitposters that have been flooding this sub with their garbage for months, and allows them to completely sidestep most of the real libertarians here. This is evidenced by the vast majority of polls here having something like an 80-3 numerical vote split, but somehow the community vote split is 50%-50%. As a result, this leaves our mods either forced to begin going ban heavy to prevent said polls from allowing Chapo and Donald trolls to completely overrun and destroy this sub, or let our sub be taken over. Rightcoast doesn't deserve complete immunity or thanks, his twitter and his previously moderated subreddits clearly depict him as more of an authoritarian nationalist than a libertarian, but of course, his banning of self-declared brigading chapo trolls was probably necessary. No matter which way we react, this has resulted in the death of liberty on reddit and a huge victory for statism. ",a26bah,self.Libertarian,,True

Father of Anarchism on Wages,Libertarian,"From Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's 'What is Property', Chapter 3: >“The capitalist,” they say, “has paid the laborers their *daily wages*.” To be accurate, it must be said that the capitalist has paid as many times one day’s wage as he has employed laborers each day, — which is not at all the same thing. For he has paid nothing for that immense power which results from the union and harmony of laborers, and the convergence and simultaneousness of their efforts. Two hundred grenadiers stood the obelisk of Luxor upon its base in a few hours; do you suppose that one man could have accomplished the same task in two hundred days? Nevertheless, on the books of the capitalist, the amount of wages paid would have been the same. Well, a desert to prepare for cultivation, a house to build, a factory to run, — all these are obelisks to erect, mountains to move. The smallest fortune, the most insignificant establishment, the setting in motion of the lowest industry, demand the concurrence of so many different kinds of labor and skill, that one man could not possibly execute the whole of them. It is astonishing that the economists never have called attention to this fact. Strike a balance, then, between the capitalist’s receipts and his payments.... >One of three things must be done. Either the laborer must be given a portion of the product in addition to his wages; or the employer must render the laborer an equivalent in productive service; or else he must pledge himself to employ him for ever. Division of the product, reciprocity of service, or guarantee of perpetual labor, — from the adoption of one of these courses the capitalist cannot escape. But it is evident that he cannot satisfy the second and third of these conditions — he can neither put himself at the service of the thousands of working-men, who, directly or indirectly, have aided him in establishing himself, nor employ them all for ever. He has no other course left him, then, but a division of the property. But if the property is divided, all conditions will be equal — there will be no more large capitalists or large proprietors. >... >Admit that twenty days’ wages suffice to feed, lodge, and clothe this multitude for twenty days: thrown out of employment at the end of that time, what will become of them, if, as fast as they create, they abandon their creations to the proprietors who will soon discharge them? While the proprietor, firm in his position (thanks to the aid of all the laborers), dwells in security, and fears no lack of labor or bread, the laborer’s only dependence is upon the benevolence of this same proprietor, to whom he has sold and surrendered his liberty. If, then, the proprietor, shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights, refuses to employ the laborer, how can the laborer live? He has ploughed an excellent field, and cannot sow it; he has built an elegant and commodious house, and cannot live in it; he has produced all, and can enjoy nothing >Labor leads us to equality. Every step that we take brings us nearer to it; and if laborers had equal strength, diligence, and industry, clearly their fortunes would be equal also. Indeed, if, as is pretended, — and as we have admitted, — the laborer is proprietor of the value which he creates, it follows: — >**1.** That the laborer acquires at the expense of the idle proprietor; >**2.** That all production being necessarily collective, the laborer is entitled to a share of the products and profits commensurate with his labor; >**3.** That all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its exclusive proprietor. >These inferences are unavoidable; these alone would suffice to revolutionize our whole economical system, and change our institutions and our laws. Why do the very persons, who laid down this principle, now refuse to be guided by it? Why do the Says, the Comtes, the Hennequins, and others — after having said that property is born of labor — seek to fix it by occupation and prescription? &#x200B;",a38070,self.Libertarian,,True

Looking for some insight on libertarianism,Libertarian,"G’day. A little background about me. I’m 26, Male, Australian, engineer. Grew up poor in a bad environment with a broken family etc etc, but have landed my self in a pretty good position in life. I definitely know the plight of the lower class but I’m comfortable now. I wouldn’t really know what to classify my political stance as. Social issues I generally lean left, though I can’t deny the economic growth that capitalism has promoted over the last century, where many socialist policies tend to fall over bar a few exceptions. I was wondering if you guys would be able to offer some insight on some of the issues I see with libertarianism and maybe help solidify my political views. 1. The free market - the premise is good, consumers vote with their wallet. If a company doesn’t offer a product that the consumer wants or someone makes it better, the company fails and is replaced by something better, ultimately benefitting the consumer. In this age, how does the consumer protect themselves from privatised media, proven to be extremely effective at making people do things against their own best interest? 2. Can the free market really succeed with the best interest of the people within industries where the profit margin often contradicts the people’s best interest i.e. Health, prison, education, defence? They would be more profitable if the consumer was sick, in jail, stupid and scared. What protections does the individual have against privatising these sectors? 3. Companies with poor employee/environmental/health practices would have no regulation, correct? I understand that companies won’t be able to lobby their way into doing these things with the governments authority as they do now, but doesn’t it just mean we are removing a step for unethical companies? Does libertarianism promote a regulatory body (FDA/EPA for example) to ensure that the products/services we purchase are made to required standards? I’m fine with people who want to smoke to smoke, as long as they are aware of the dangers, but without someone on the other side informing us, we wouldn’t even know. 4. What’s stoping a monopoly? 5. This is anecdotal, and I may be wrong, though I’m under the impression that social systems - like welfare - promote less crime and better public health. Welfare generally gets a bad wrap in Aus, though I think it’s important for a society to stay healthy. What’s the libertarian view on this. 6. Aus is heavily taxed and government spending is notoriously wasteful. While I hear a lot of the “tax is theft” rhetoric, I don’t mind giving some of what I have to promote a safer, healthier society. How would privatisation help this, i.e how would helping the poor and desperate prove to be an effective business model in any sense. That will probably do for now, excuse my ignorance on any of the above. Just trying to get a better understanding. I’m about to fall asleep but will try and answer back to anything in the morning. Cheers for any help! ",a2coif,self.Libertarian,,True

"Mob rule, Direct Democracy, and Libertarian values",Libertarian,"TL;DR Mob rule is not systemic, but rather endemic to some direct/radical democracies and we have far too much emotional baggage left over from the Reign of Terror. Transition from liberal representative to direct democracy would facilitate a more efficient, smaller, and transparent government and and a more free people and should be undertaken and viewed as a key libertarian value. Direct democracies are not destined to be ruled by the mob. They are the next step in a centuries long evolution of the idea of liberty and personal freedom. Frequently criticized on the basis that they will inevitably devolve into a system of mob rule, direct democratic systems are saddled with the emotional baggage left over from the darkest days of the French Revolution. Direct democracies should be the next step in our evolution of our political systems and would result in more efficient, enfranchised, and ethical government and a more free population than has previously been possible. Mob rule is not a systemic problem with full participatory government, but rather, it is a endemic problem when a repressed population of a autocratic and centralized government is suddenly given the enfranchisement which they never had dreamed of. In the most cited cases of Tyranny of the majority, the preceding period in their history was almost always an absolutist regime with a brief and ill prepared and managed period of actual representation. The french revolution to the Bourbons, the Nazis with Wilhelm, the November with Nicholas. These mob reactions are things which are aimed at revenging the repression of the last regime, the lighter the repression, the lighter the reaction. If a liberal representative democracy were to transition to a direct democracy with a well thought out transition path there would be no backlash, no guillotine, no terror.  One of the greatest arguments against the transition from absolutism to representative democracies was that there was no way that a deliberative body could be as efficient or as responsive as an absolute body which would rule from god’s will alone. In practice this it has been shown that this was a vast miss-calculation and one can see the parallels in common arguments against direct democracies today. The idea that participatory government would not be efficient or responsive seems to mirror those arguments against representative government from centuries earlier. Another key argument against direct democracies frequently relies on having a “well enough educated” population, i.e. one that is responsible enough to be trusted with the reigns of power. One can again see the parallel with the ancient arguments that kings and monarchs were the only ones whose divine judgment was the only thing keeping their kingdom safe and on their correct path. Instead of this form of “well enough educated” thinking we could instead look at this problem from another angle. It is not that the halls of power are too much for an population to master, but rather that they have been hidden behind a mask of institutional knowledge. This knowledge has been hidden away in both absolute and representative regimes and can be used as a tool of repression by those with despotic intentions. Until this institutional knowledge is given to all, there exists an unstable equilibrium of liberty in any sovereign body.",a6r9ei,self.Libertarian,,True

Paypal could use their influence to tell other companies not to process their payments because then they would not process the payments. Business would do a risk assessment and they would not make payments to subscribe star because the economic powerhouse of paypal is so large that they would not want to risk their wrath for some measly amount of money.

A System Designed to Fail; what the fuck is going on here?,Libertarian,"It almost seems unreal how fast the liberty we loved disappeared here. On so many levels is this new community point system and level of interaction by admin/mods completely against the core principles of our subreddit. And when I say our subreddit, I mean everyone from the anacaps to the full blown commies; the Chapo's, the TD's, the lefties, the right wingers. EVERYONE. At the very fundamental core of libertarianism; no matter how you expand out to what this looks like, or how it is implemented or how large/small a government must be... Is the individual. Everything between can be debated, disagreed, rehashed, ignored or completely throw out. But the individual is our Core. And from what I can gather, complete absolute war has been declared on this. &#x200B; What we face now is nothing short of centralization, moderation and collectivization of thought. This does not belong here. In what looks like a thinly veiled attempt to 'remove the trolls, shitposters and brigaders' what has actually happened is creating a system that inherently favors them. Not only does the implementation reek of gatekeeping, it effectively is creating an oligarchy on what is acceptable discussion. In the inherent design of the point system, those who are legacy, those who are prolific spammers, those who have organized brigading are able to accumulate weight much faster than individuals; especially anyone new to the sub. When the points were first awarded I went through and started looking at how much some average posters had, compared to our resident spammers, shitposters, and trolls... and wow, I see trolls with 300K+ points and average members having civil, open debate with less than 1k. This should be blatantly obvious that the weighted values and point system is ripe for abuse, and destroys something we should cherish. The merit of any single individual to expose and present their view; for any other individual to be exposed to other views and be the master of their own decisions. Now, we face the very real risk that those who wish to censor will by nature of the design, end up controlling content. When the content is controlled, it becomes nearly impossible to get community points to counter this... because well to get them you need to have positive interaction, need to be able to post it, and if you are in the 'wrong group' it will never surface and never get evaluated. &#x200B; This needs to go away. I know the trolls have been annoying, but as individuals we could block, ignore, respond and decide how we wanted to deal with it. We do not have the right to decide for others. We do not have the right to decide what is acceptable thought, and what is acceptable speech. Our sub will become far worse than the problem they claim to want to solve. &#x200B; So I ask everyone, from the bottom of my heart. Oppose this. In anyway you can, in anyway you can think of. I am asking this of everyone. The anacaps, the chapos, the lefties, the socialist, the right.... if you can think of a group, a label, a person, an individual... I am asking you. Oppose this. I know many of you might think this is a great opportunity for YOU to get rid of those YOU do not want. But the poison of this kind of centralization is it is the framework to silence you as well. Right now you might be on the favored side, and think you are getting what you want. But this is a weapon that can be used against you as well. To the right afraid of the left, they will use this if they can. To the left afraid of the right, they will use this if they can. &#x200B; We have to face a very serious reality. We don't like each other here, we never will, that is the point. The freedom to be YOU, not to be someone else... But there can only be one winner in centralization, and it's never going to be you. As the individual, it will never be you. So to everyone who I can possible reach, I beg you overlook your differences and protect that only thing that universally benefits all of us; our freedom to be here, our freedom to think, our freedom to express.

It's contradictory to have a letter of intent that isn't singed. So I want the context, is 'it' referring to the actual deal, and not the letter of intent, or did he just babble? I don't know why CNN doesn't have the interview/transcript, which makes this whole thing seem fucky, I mean honestly idk what people would try to get out of it when Trump jr and other people already noted that they signed a letter of intent way back when, and even Giuliani noted they had it.

I am from the uk and remember reading about an issue where the government were massivly overpaying for laptops, like 4 times the price because of a 'prefered supplier' and the people ordering them just wouldn't care. Maybe if you had it so the government announced a new purchase, say 100 of these laptops, and gave two weeks for people to offer counter solutions that would be cheaper, and that individual or company would get a percentage of the money saved. They would review it obviously and weigh up if it was worth the money saved, like there wouldn't be much point in saving 6% for a laptop thats actually worth only a tenth of the origional one. No one likes the government taking their money by force but would this perhaps be a step in the right direction, to see their money spent more efficently to help lower taxes? Like people could bid on government contracts, and the cheapest ones that can deliver a good result will be selected after a week or so.

Gerrymandering a state constitution - New Jersey Democrats propose an amendment to entrench their power,Libertarian,"Democrats love to complain about gerrymandering, but they sure don’t hesitate to deploy it to maximum effect. Case in point is New Jersey, where the Democratic Legislature is trying to lock in one-party rule by essentially enshrining it in the state Constitution. New Jersey has 40 districts that elect representatives to the state Senate and the General Assembly. Each decade after the U.S. census, the task of drawing new lines falls to a 10-person commission, with five members picked by each party chairman. When the two sides stalemate, the chief justice of the state Supreme Court appoints an 11th member. This setup theoretically insulates redistricting from partisan politics, though it hasn’t in practice. Nonetheless, Democrats in the Legislature would like the rules to work more explicitly in their favor. Hence their proposal to apply a deceptive new “fairness” test. A constitutional amendment they’re advancing would expand the redistricting commission to 13 members, with legislative leaders getting eight picks, half of whom must be lawmakers. More important, it would mandate that at least 10 state legislative districts be “competitive.” It also supposedly would guarantee that Republicans and Democrats get an equal number of districts that “favor” their candidates. The trouble is that those terms are defined relative to a skewed baseline: each party’s performance over 10 years in statewide elections. Ballots for Barack Obama and Senator Cory Booker would affect how districts for the state Legislature are redrawn in 2021. Why include these unrelated federal offices in the calculation, unless the goal is to juice the Democratic average? Measured by this fudged benchmark, a district that leans Democratic by, say, eight points could still be deemed “competitive.” Even areas drawn intentionally to “favor” the GOP would merely need to be less Democratic than average. “They’re going to create an electoral system in the state that is going to be rigged to elect only Democratic members into the majority,” Tom Kean Jr., the Senate minority leader, told local media. A constitutional amendment requires voter approval. The Legislature can put this on the 2019 ballot by passing it with a simple majority two years in a row. So a vote in December and another in January would suffice. If it gets that far, perhaps the electorate will see the partisan motivations at work. But the proposed ballot language is a political disguise. One part reads: “Do you approve requiring the commission to establish districts that fairly represent voter party preferences in Presidential, United States Senate, and gubernatorial elections in the previous 10 years?” New Jersey’s Democrats are unintentionally making an important point. Drawing district lines is inherently a political act. Giving the job to an independent commission can veil the dirty work, but that’s about it. What Democrats in Trenton really want is a permanent majority, and they’re trying to rig the state Constitution to provide it. ",a3k2gv,self.Libertarian,,True

Corruption is a market distortion, so why would anyone concerned with an idealized free market not intervene in the market in order to insure it performs in an idealized manner? If it is the libertarian view that it isn't incumbent on society to intervene, what market mechanism ensures that corrupt actors don't gain unfair advantage, thus created a sort positive feedback loop wherein all businesses must engage in corruption and fraud in order to compete?

When, therefore, plunder is organized by law, for the profit of those who perpetrate it, all the plundered classes tend, either by peaceful or revolutionary means, to enter in some way into the manufacturing of laws. These classes, according to the degree of enlightenment at which they have arrived, may propose to themselves two very different ends, when they thus attempt the attainment of their political rights; either they may wish to put an end to lawful plunder, or they may desire to take part in it.' - Frédéric Bastiat ",a2id6d,self.Libertarian,,True

The right side won't admit capitalism isn't working properly and the left won't admit, that all things being equal, capitalism is better. If y'all ain't here the right ignores me and the anarchists are like sitting at the little kid's table. Or racism, I earned in the sixties and seventies race doesn't determine character and not to respect any race over others (later it made sense to add sex and religion). Both right and left seem to have favored groups they like to respect over others and they get mad when you don't respect their favored groups more. So I can always find my comments by filtering by 'controversial', until they sent you lefties away. I'm glad you're back. Some of the rights were annoyed at your antics and frankly, since you lefties are right half the time, it makes them a little uncomfortable. So I invite you to troll my posts, no one else wants to. One of two things will happen, we'll explore libertarianism and work at building consensus on getting 'liberty and justice for all' or you'll learn to leave me alone, like the hermit I am. I should warn you, my snark setting is on a hair trigger. See we've got a government that has been getting more authoritarian since Reagan and the 1% owns more than ever. The MIC is out of control, we incarcerate our citizens at 'shithole' proportions and our justice department is run by money. Both the Democrats and Republicans work for the 1% and just gave US two of the most hated candidates ever. On top of all that is a orange orangutan who may win a second term. This is getting real. I desperately want change and about the only solution is third party. Unfortunately than means libertarians need to get out of mom's basement, get a job and be someone.

But the thing is its not your right to earn money with it. Its market condition that determains if you will be able to make money with it or not. Since if you write a song and youre automatically entitled to something if a radio station or Spotify plays it, through your intellectual property rights it messes the whole thing up and creates a massive amout of regulation and actually spending as a result of that. &#x200B; The internet and its free marketplace are already, in a very niche sense, working their way around it by having stuff like torrents and bitcoin so you can at least, in a very complicated/non tolerated manner, OPT-OUT. &#x200B; But i think you're getting my point. &#x200B; Distribution of ideas and art should be freely available if the market allows it. And it would, if it wasnt prohibited by the state. &#x200B; Let me know what you think, or any other examples that fits the same narrative",a3hoal,self.Libertarian,,True

Libertarian Society with this sub as a small-scale model,Libertarian,"The policies of a nation will be reflected in the culture of the people participating in it. As the culture shifts, policies should mirror those changes. If the political framework fails to change along with the culture, it becomes antagonistic to the culture leading to civil disobedience. The governing policies that aren't reflected in the culture will inevitably fail to be respected by the people. With sufficient desynchronization of people and policy, some form of revolution is bound to follow. In a hypothetical libertarian system with libertarian people, there would be few policies to maintain and the culture could freely evolve as long as the central tenants of the culture didn't breach libertarian philosophy. However, such a thing doesn't and may never exist, because there are those that don't share the same values and perspective of libertarians. Knowing this, authoritarian subcultures would spring up. If that culture grew to substantial demographic, then there would likely be a change in policy to match. --- It's evident to everyone that this sub is a target for a lot of dishonest argumentation. The principles of free speech are maintained to the point where those participating in good faith are drowned out by those that aren't in addition to the usual issues plaguing internet communities such as low-effort reposts of memes. People from subreddits that are antithetical to libertarianism are free to come here and share their minds knowing that the reverse would most likely lead to a ban. If this sub were a small-scale of a libertarian society, I think it's evident that the society wouldn't remain as such for long. The culture of a free society is chaotic. The lack of homogeneity toward liberty ultimately undermines said liberty. While a libertarian system would allow for a free market of ideas and expressions between people, some of those ideas will become toxic to that environment. As that culture overtakes the libertarian one, the freedom that allowed the new one to take over will fade. The policies will then reflect this culture and become more authoritarian leading to a diminishing market of ideas. The only reason this hasn't happened in this sub is because the policies of the sub and the culture within it have been somewhat divorced. The mod team is extremely hands-off, the rules(guidelines) aren't bannable offenses, and no one really wants that to change. Given the ability to change our policies or moderation, the chaotic culture created by that liberty would fall victim to the bad-faith actors and those that demand order. **Get to the point already!!!** Sorry. The point is that this place has remained a place of free speech because there isn't a way for an organized collection of users here to change the rules like one can in a democratic society. Therefore, I'd suggest that for a libertarian society to exist it would need to separate policy from culture as much as possible to keep any one culture from overriding others. I might even go so far as to suggest that there shouldn't be a legislative extension of the government to actively make changes to policy; instead, applying a basic framework for society and then expecting citizens to fill in all the gaps. This way, any sufficient authoritarian culture would have to overthrow the government in order to enact new policies that reflect that culture. What do you think? Do disagree with any of my premises? If you aren't libertarian, how would you exploit that system to impose your own policies?",a2wa31,self.Libertarian,,True

'I’m opposed the very existence of the State' - Doug Casey,Libertarian," “I’m opposed the very existence of the State. I’m opposed to it on moral grounds, because its essence is coercion. I’m opposed to it on economic grounds, because it’s more a threat to everyone’s property than a guardian of it. On practical grounds, since it’s necessarily inefficient in doing what it’s supposed to do, and does everything it’s not supposed to do. On aesthetic grounds, since it inevitably draws the worst kind of people to its employment. On evidential grounds, since its main products are wars, taxes, regulations, inflation, pogroms, and the like.” \--Doug Casey. &#x200B; How are the Bill of Rights holding up today?: ",a4ehaa,self.Libertarian,,True

Libertarians and Banking,Libertarian,"What is the general Libertarian thought on the US Banking system? I know the Fed is generally bad, as are large corporate banks that are propped up by their enormous lobbying efforts. Should banks be corporate in the sense that they should be making a profit beyond what's necessary for innovation, security, and payroll? What about smaller banks? Are they good in some regards or are all banks frowned upon? I ask this because I am curious and I have spent my relatively short adult life working in the banking and lending industries. Automation and things like blockchain in recent years make a compelling argument against them. Borderline indomitable security, both physical and digital, make even more compelling arguments for them. I would love to know people's opinions and read any articles anyone might have on the subject.",aa24l3,self.Libertarian,,True

The war in Afghanistan,Libertarian,People are saying that there will be great instability if we leave and that we need to clean up the mess we made. But I would argue we didn't make a mess in the first place. In 2001 the Taliban controlled most of Afghanistan. In 2018 the Taliban controls most of Afghanistan except for Kabul. We changed nothing. We achieved nothing. And it's time to recognize the war in Afghanistan for what it is. A failure and a colossal waste of lives and resources. We lost.

Positive social externalities and how they relate to goods provided by the government,Libertarian,"A common libertarian principle seems to be that everything (or nearly everything) the government provides could be provided by the private sector (police, military, roads, etc.). While I generally agree that the government is wildly inefficient and the private sector is the best option for many services I also believe there would be a legitimate shortage issue for goods with positive social externalities due to a couple reasons. 1. The free loader problem. This is a market failure that occurs when a common resource can be taken advantage of by anyone whether they payed for it or not. In this case, an example would be a police force. If you didn’t help fund the private police force if you called 911 (or however you contact this private company) would they refuse service? If they didn’t refuse service this would be a perfect place for the free loader problem to come into play. And if they do refuse service, is that really the environment you want to live in where certain people who can afford to pay are given police protection while others aren’t? 2. The second problem I see is apathy. The general public doesn’t care about things that don’t directly affect them. If everyone was given the opportunity to only spend money on things they feel are right anything that doesn’t have easily accessible wide public appeal would fail within a short period of time. The counter argument I would expect to see would be that because laborers have earned their money it’s not the government’s to take away and use how they want and not how the individual wants. I understand this, but I don’t see society functioning nearly as well without some sort of government intervention/taxation (even if it’s at a smaller level than it is right now).

(Que 'Glory Days' and stick your hand in your pants like Al Bundy) Years ago (let's not count) I was getting my butt kicked on the line. Backs were running over me like lobbyists flocking to politicians. Coach grabbed my facemask and yelled 'what the hell is the problem'. I told him I was getting double teamed. He yelled back 'of course you are, you're twice as big as they are...when you're getting your butt kicked go back to basics'. It worked and I stopped getting run over and we won handily. You could safely assume I'm fairly 'long in the tooth' and life has kicked my butt more than once after that. I remembered that lesson though and that's allowed me to remedy the situation. Going back to basics has almost always worked, when my butts dragging. Now we've got a bunch of hooligans causing trouble in the neighborhood. Go back to basics;  if you need to engage use the party platform. When we go off on our own tangents, we become easy targets.

Choice.,Libertarian,"Hello everyone, hope y’all all had a great holiday or holidays. I come here today because I had an idea and don’t really know what to think about it. I think it allows for more choice regarding “taxes”. So I was thinking. If tax payers are given a sheet of paper during tax season, the money we have to fork over is usually used in ways we don’t want since we have no choice in how our taxes are used. Well with sheet of paper you could theoretically fill in the slots for what you as a citizen want your taxes to be used for. Examples are infrastructure, military, education, border issues etc. we could do this for our state taxes and federal taxes. I’m curious as to wether or not this is a good idea. I was stoned and had a few beers in me but I can’t help but feel this is a good idea and should be in place since our money is basically forced from our pockets let us at least choose how our money is spent. It would I believe help cut down on reckless spending and I think it’s fair. We could see what citizens really want to improve. And if the government wants to increase military spending or whatnot they have to pull the funds from somewhere else since our taxes are theoretically going to what we the people want them to be used for.

/r/libertarian should create a Constitution to protect individual freedom from the polls!,Libertarian,"IMO the polls will give a majority the ability to enforce rules upon the minority.

I suggest using the polls to create a /r/Libertarian/ Constitution. Understand it would symbolic but might help gauge the liberal health of the sub. I believe most subscribed here, as of right now, believe in protecting individual freedom, especially freedom of expression. We should request the polls never be used to hinder that freedom for the sake the majority. And post these symbolic rules on the side of the sub. For example: Constitutional Request, Polls are never allowed to ban a user. Yes or No Constitutional Request, Polls should never be used to punished a mod for freedom of expression and/or association Yes or No Of course someone could always try to make a poll that breaks the symbolic rules or request an amendment.

RANT: Sick and tired of left wing liberal gun control advocates.,Libertarian,"Man, fucking don't get me started. You go back to 1356 and tell someone that a few hundred armored men with swords could wipe out tens of thousands of people, easily, in a few days and no one would bat an eye. They all know how a fight goes when one guy has a sword and another one doesn't. But people these days think someone invented the gun and all of a sudden knives just can't hurt you anymore, because of magic or feelings or SHIT FUCKING IGNORANCE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BUTCHERED AN ANIMAL. If you've got a machete you can kill anyone in arms reach as easy as breathing and your reach is pretty fucking long when you add two feet of steel to it. In a room full of school children the difference between a glock and a machete is that one needs to be fucking reloaded. Saying a pistol is more lethal than a sword is like saying an elephant is heavier than a hippo; It doesn't do you any fucking good when you're trying to lift the fucking hippo. By the same token a bullet being more lethal than a sword doesn't mean dick when someone's half chopped your fucking head off. You know what the most important difference is between Rwanda and a high school classroom? There are plenty of places to run in Rwanda. We haven't seen a mass killing with a sword in America (recently, Everyone seems to forget that swords and axes and pikes worked just fine for killing the Native Americans) is that guns are a more convenient way to kill people. But in China they don't have guns so you get mass killings, in schools no less, with fucking knives.",a1zk3i,self.Libertarian,,True
Can I still consider myself to be Libertarian even if I believe certain taxes/government interference is necessary?,Libertarian,"As the title states, I like to think of myself as a libertarian.

However, I can't read or hear anything that compels me to say that we cannot have tax. I fundamentally think we need a law enforcement, roads, city maintenance. The argument of privatization of these things just isn't strong enough for me. I completely agree that private police do a way better job than the state, but realistically how could that work out for the average citizen? By all means, I'm only here to learn and better my opinion; so if anyone has an opinion, or perhaps would like to change my mind, I'm all ears. Thanks!",a6e0ux,self.Libertarian,,True

Doesn’t that just seem... unethical? From my perspective, a statist should view that as an antitrust violation, and a libertarian should view that as a dangerous oligarchy. I’ve brought it up a few times, but seem to get downvoted with very little discussion of why.

Can deflation be looked as a subsidy? If your money increases in value through deflation then aren't you gaining wealth without producing anything?

Well let's sort this out: liberals are more pro-liberty than conservatives? Are you $#!$ serious?,Libertarian,"First of all, liberal as in modern liberals, referring to the western left. I understand it's a bummer that this term has been 'appropriated' by the left but let's not cry over spilled milk OK??? OK. To whomever call they-self (am I using your gender pronoun correctly you yellow belly fragile cupcakes?) a libertarian: If you actually, like, not in a tongue-in-cheek way, not in a sarcastic, in a half-joking way believe in that literally, like literally literally that liberals are better than conservatives when it comes to freedom, then I'm sorry, you are not a libertarian, period, that's the kindest fudging words I can pass on to you and I mean not the slightest ill-intention. I think you are simply delusional and do not possess the kind of intellectual depth or mental fortitude to be a libertarian. I get it I get it, both of them do things which hurt liberty, but let's be perfectly, 100% clear about this: the conservatives do that because they are fudging stupid, the liberals do that because they actually fudging hate freedom. Now- back in the days, mark the words, back in the days, things went like this: conservatives are pro-market freedom but anti social liberty, and liberals are vice versa, and libertarians are pro both. Things have changed. The conservatives are fairly pro-social freedom now. There are a significant amount of atheist/non-religious conservatives, and a lot more (though I doubt it's the majority) pro-LGBT conservatives. Milo? That paypal guy? Hello?? This is a simple post, it's already getting long enough and a lot of things need Merriam-Webster thick books to elaborate so I'll probably not going to change a lot of minds, but I'll ask one simple question to the 'left-leaning' libertarians here reading this: Let's say it's a dystopian scenario. Parallel reality. You get to choose one from 2 worlds and you MUST choose one: World 1, a more conservative dystopia where you have pretty much 100% economic freedom, your property rights is 100% guaranteed (don't be a dick man it's a hypothetical scenario so bear with me OK don't tell me it's impossible yes it's impossible I'm trying to make a point here) but you have zero social liberty. You only get to marry what the government tell you to marry, you can't speak what the government dose not allow you to etc. etc. Gays of course are banned. World 2, a more liberal dystopia that is pretty much the opposite to world 1, where you have 100% social liberty, meaning theoretically you can shag a goat in public and the government wouldn't give 2 cents, you can criticize any politician you want freely, you can have a massive inter-species orgy in front of a church and the general attitude of both the government and the church would be 'Meh? What you gotta do? It's not like it's illegal' BUT! You have zero economic freedom, meaning when you decide to send an angry twits directed at a politician (which again, no problem, the politician can do nothing legally or administratively about it) you can, but you first have to submit a formal request in the form of an online form, at the most immediate computer terminal you could find, with probably 12 people waiting in a queue to use it because like you, their previous request to be allocated a computer was not approved, to get an electronic device capable of sending a twit. Annnnd you are gonna have to walk there which is 3 miles away because computing devices are in constant shortage for some reason and your request to have a personal vehicle is still pending, the nearest bus stop is half a mile away and the bus comes every 3 hours because for some reason, vehicle production is constantly low. world 3, there is no world 3 just go with my stupid hypothetical scenario and don't be a dick. And as a closing statement: black market has always been the best arguments for libertarians. It's not a random statement, if you have grinded to a rather high level libertarian, you know what I mean. ",a6ldls,self.Libertarian,,True

What is a libertarian and how libertarian am I?,Libertarian,"I have recently started lurking on this subreddit trying to figure out exactly what libertarianism is and what libertarians believe, particularly in the United States. I'm 33 now and ever since I became remotely interested in politics around age 18 or so I haven't really identified with Republicans or Democrats. It's not that I feel a strong need to align with a particular party, and from what I've seen here considering yourself libertarian doesn't necessarily mean you completely align with the libertarian party in the US, but I have a hard time identifying my overall politics without going through every issue and stating my position on it. In some situations I end up referring to myself as libertarian but then get some responses that make me question if I'm really aware of what libertarianism is and if I'm a libertarian. I'm sure I'll get some varying responses but if you all would endulge me in confirming or correcting my view of libertarianism as well as which of my beliefs actually align with libertarianism I would appreciate it. Also if there are any widely accepted authories on the subject that you could link me to I would appreciate it. Its not that I haven't researched this on my own at all, but I've read a lot of contradictory stuff and a lot of what I've come across reads as if the writer's intention is to paint libertarianism in a negative light rather than give the facts. So firstly, my extremely simple understanding of libertarianism is that it supports as small a government as possible without devolving into anarchism. Basically that the government should as much as possible stay out of people's lives and decisions as long as one person/group isn't violating the rights of another person group. I'm not sure how a libertarian would define rights here. I feel like I know what is and isn't a right but not sure how to articulate it. Because I think Democrats and Republicans would consider themselves to have this ideology to a certain extent too. It's not like either party is admitting to having a bunch of superfluous legislation. I feel like both parties have expanded and contracted what a right is to come up with some bastardized standard. But doesn't every ideology define rights for themselves? What makes a libertarian right true and a conservative or liberal right false? Anyway, to list the major issues I'm against intervening in foreign wars unless there is a very specific national defense interest to do so. I'm pro gun (to the point even some people who consider themselves pro 2A would consider me extreme). I support gay marriage although I don't believe the government should be in the business of deciding which 2 (or more) consenting adults can enter into a marriage contract. I am against pretty much any form of prohibition unless simply possessing the prohibited item causes a very specific harm to others or if any possible use of the item would cause harm to others. I for easing the path to immigration to America but also enforcing laws for those who still come illegally. This one troubles me because it seems it take a massive expansion of government to pull that off. I think business should be allowed to sell what they want to who they want, but I think there would need to be some protection against a certain demographic being completely denied access to a commodity. Again not sure that would decrease or increase government. I don't have a very strong stance one way or another on abortion. It is admittedly a gray area for me. Finally a couple issues I honestly don't know enough about to know which way I would be pushing the legislation. I do support some environmental regulations. I don't know enough about it to say what exactly, or how it would compare to what we have now, but I have a problem with a business or industry making their living by destroying air, water, soil quality because people don't have an option to avoid these things. I also don't know enough to have a specific view on healthcare, but I have a hard time not seeing at least basic healthcare as a human right. IE not being able to fix a broken leg or get antibiotics for an infection. Shit happens and I'm not saying we keep everyone alive at all costs, but I don't think people should be forced to endure some of the simpler afflictions. Thanks in advance for any replies. I am definitely not here to praise or disparage libertarianism. Just trying to understand it better and how much I do or don't already subscribe to the ideology. I'm admittedly pretty ignorant on a couple key aspects and am pretty sure some of the views I listed go against libertarianism, but the way I understand it I feel it is an appealing ideology.

For example - Sandel in Justice gives the example of price gouging during a hurricane. E.g firms selling essentials like water for extortionate prices. So my worry is that there does seem to be a moral issue here too. More generally, surely the most vulnerable people with the least economic opportunities should be helped out by the state through taxation. We can’t all be Bill Gates or Michael Jordan.

"the fundamental impotence of anarcho-capitalism as a system, and its impact as a political ideology",Libertarian,"Underlying anarcho-capitalism is the belief that the government and the economy are two entities which may be held completely separate from one another. In this relationship, the anarcho-capitalist believes that the state oppresses the capital and prevents it from achieving its real potential. What the anarcho-capitalist does not fully realize, is that the state itself is at all times maintained and legitimized by the capital for its own interests. The most wealthy in society engage the most in its institutions, and they also seek to impress the most policy. In this way, it must be rationalized that anarcho-capitalism is not really a condition very separate from ours at all. We live in an anarchic world. From (and within) anarchy, the capitalists have administered their own preferred state. We see that in the effectiveness of lobbying, campaign contributions, and in that business representatives will often even draft the actual policy which is presented to congress to become law. These realities can be summarized in another way: business leaders are not anarcho-capitalists. They do not want to be, and it would be unwise for them to change their minds. Business leaders want protection, subsidies, bailouts and tax incentives. Business leaders DIRECTLY seek to govern in a vacuum, and can be trusted to extinguish any brief instance of anarchy should they find it. So, the idols of anarcho-capitalism would (and do) outright reject it as an ideology. They would not see it as an improvement to our current system. Now, what does that mean for anarcho-capitalist ideologues and voters? Effectively, while they seek to empower business in the face of government, they only succeed in their effort to reduce any democratic elements in government. They vote by way of an institution they don’t believe in, for the benefit of capitalists who don’t believe in them. And, as irony would have it, authoritarians find the most success appealing to constituencies who feel an increasing distrust in democracy. This is where ancaps have laid their legacy in modern America and Russia. This tendency is also what produces the “pipeline” from libertarianism to fascism, because libertarians often become anarcho-capitalists, and ancaps necessarily have no way of preventing people from forming their own government. Facing their failure to prevent a government, many ancaps seek an institution to prevent democracy instead.",a358ta,self.Libertarian,,True

Remove all taxes and use inflation,Libertarian,"What are your thoughts on this? The idea is to go to a flat percentage tax that is imposed naturally via (maybe a bit higher) inflation. The government inflates the money supply by (lets say) 5% per year and uses that to fund roads, education, etc. NO OTHER TAXES are issued. All the paperwork and accountants and loopholes can be done away with. Just in the administrative costs everyone (government, businesses, and citizens) would save a ton of time and money. &#x200B; Potential issue: If the inflation rate is too high everyone sells their dollars and flees to a more stable currency (Bitcoin, Euro, Gold, whatever).

Pro-Gun and Pro-Police?,Libertarian,"I'm not necessarily a libertarian, Id like to think I fall into the middle of everything, because I have views that can align with everyone.

Pull us the hell out of every other country, we are not the world police. Defend our own country, stop sending money and american lives overseas. Use that money we're spending on other countries to spend on ourselves. We have homeless people and hungry children who could use it instead. 3. Free Speech is neccessary, no matter what it is, online or in public. You cant ban words. But something I cant seem to get is why the unfiltered unthinking hate for cops from libertarians. Every cop I know, and I mean every cop I know, is as pro gun as you or me. My family and close close friends are full of cops, and they hate gun control as much as you and I. And I *guess* if it was legal they would have already buried their bump stocks, and urged myself and others to do the same. I mean, *that's all hypothetical though*. Theres even the stories of the Massachusetts police refusing to do bump stock seizures. Or the few California Counties Sheriffs that ignored state law and relaxed AR15 and Concealed Carry laws in their counties. I get the feeling that if the time ever comes that guns bans are enacted like in Europe, your local police wouldnt just roll over and let that happen, especially the ones I know. So why is it you cant be libertarian and support the police, especially your local police, who in my experience tend to be more pro-gun than someone like the feds?

Can We Talk About The Green New Deal?,Libertarian,"Trigger warning: if you're not used to reading long posts, skip this one. To begin, the article I’m going to be quoting from and referring to is “With a Green New Deal, Here’s What the World Could Look Like for the Next Generation” by The Intercept, published December 5, 2018, author Kate Aronoff.  It’s a long article that beings with someone born around 2021 and graduating from college in 2043. Gina, as the fictional character is named, grew up with her parents having a *“year of paid family leave they were entitled to”* and being dropped off at a *“free child care program.”* Her college education was free, but only after a year of public service during which she helped restore wetlands and volunteered at a daycare. She doesn’t have to worry about health insurance, because everyone is covered. She also doesn’t have massive issues with rent because public, rent-controlled housing is now available in *“any number of buildings that the country’s top architects have competed for the privilege to design, featuring lush green spaces, child care centers and even bars and restaurants.”* Bills are easier, because *“broadband and clean water are both free and publicly provisioned, and the solar array that is spread atop the roofs of her housing complex generates all the power it needs and more.”* She makes good money because all the jobs for college graduates are *“well-paid, unionized positions.”* *“At any number of American Job Centers around the country, she can walk in and work with a counselor to find a well-paid position on projects that help make her city better able to deal with rising tides and more severe storms, or oral history projects, or switch careers altogether and receive training toward a union job in the booming clean energy sector.”* She might work for herself, since healthcare costs aren’t burdening small businesses any longer. No matter what, though, she’ll work *“no more than 40 hours a week”* and will partake of *“locally-sourced food and drink.”* She’ll travel by high-speed, zero-carbon rail. Libertarians and AnCaps out there are wondering how the flying fuck all this gets paid for. Hold your horses, we’ll eventually get to that. (Bonerchill post note: We kinda do and we kinda don't.) *“We build things here in Detroit, and across Michigan, and we’ve got a lot of people here with manufacturing skills who are being left behind by the corporate greed,” Rep. Rashida Tlaib said via email.* *“Renewable portfolio standards require utilities to source a certain amount of their power from wind and solar.”* *‘”You say, you hit the target and you reduce emissions 10 percent every year or you go to jail,” says Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. “That would get their attention.”’* Whoa. Wait. Hold up. If private companies don’t hit a goal, a goal which is set by politicians who may not even partially understand the requirements of enacting that goal, you’re going to send WHO to jail? Their R&D departments? Their C-level? Then who’s going to move things forward, a new guy without any experience at that company- and what’s going to entice him, the possibility of going to jail next year? Don’t worry, The Intercept has the answers: *“That may sound aggressive by today’s standards, but has been par for the course at other points in American history when the country has faced existential threats.”* Oh, thanks. That makes me feel better. *“Among the most iconic imaged of these changed power relationships was a widely circulated image of Sewell Avery, the president of Montgomery Ward. During World War II, Montgomery Ward, a mail-order corporation, produced everything from uniforms to bullets for soldiers abroad. In 1944, the National War Labor Board ordered Avery, a Nazi sympathizer, to let his employees unionize to ward off a strike, and the ensuing disruption in war production. When he refused, President Franklin D. Roosevelt* (aka ‘God-King’ - Bonerchill) *ordered the National Guard to haul him off, chair and all, and seize the company’s main plant in Chicago. The government took over operations at the company’s factories in several other cities by the year’s end. And by the end of the war, around a quarter of all domestic manufacturing had been nationalized for the sake of the war effort.”* Snap. Remember folks, the Fourth Amendment only means shit if the government didn’t give itself the power to waive it. The Intercept does say, *“Notably, Green New Deal proponents aren’t pushing for such drastic action. Yet given the collision course between the fossil fuel industry’s business model and a livable future, simply building up more renewable power will almost certainly need to be paired with constraints on the fossil fuel industry.”* So they aren’t pushing for such drastic action but if it’s deemed necessary, it may not be off the table? Cool, that’s all I wanted to know. Face down, ass up, America- your government needs you. Further conversation about green jobs and then out comes the following: *”A federal job guarantee, which is cited in the draft resolution and a hot topic among 2020 presidential hopefuls, might put people to work remediating wetlands and tending community gardens while providing an alternative to low-paid work bound up in hugely carbon-intensive supply chains… A federal jobs guarantee that paying that much, as outlined by several proposals, would effectively create a national wage floor, compelling retail and fast food chains to either raise their wages or risk having their employees enticed into better-paid jobs that improve their communities and make them more resilient against climate impacts.”* Ah yes, that’s where the New Deal comes out. It’s not a minimum wage if the government hires people at a greater-than-market rate. It’s “free market.” *smirks in leftist* After this, $141 billion is listed as a potential cost of heat-related deaths in 2100, sea-level rise is $118 billion and infrastructure damages up to $32 billion. Burnt ends. *“By comparison, the 1 to 2 percent of gross domestic product that Pollin* (remember him? He wants to make change compulsory- Bonerchill) *has said a Green New Deal would cost seems pretty cheap.”* Based on what? What years are you using? Data please. The numbers I’m coming up with aren’t cheap but assuming similar increases to GDP, they’ll be a drop in the bucket compared to the growth of current welfare systems in place. My numbers say ~$430-860bn. Oh shit, Warren Mosler’s not-dead-yet ghost comes into play: *”In a piece co-authored by Greg Carlock, author of a Green New Deal prospectus for the upstart think tank Data for Progress* (Bonerchill notes: Manager at World Resources Institute, worked for the ICF, Joint Global Change Research Institute, US House of Representatives and went to the University of Maryland School of Public Policy)*; and Andres Bernal, an adviser to Ocasio-Cortez* (Bonerchill notes: Can’t find shit on this dude)*; and Stephanie Kelton, former chief economist on the Senate Budget Committee* (Bonerchill notes: and apparently also a leading proponent of Modern Monetary Theory)*, the writers explain, “… As the checks go out, the government’s bank – the Federal Reserve – clears the payments by crediting the seller’s bank account with digital dollars. In other words, Congress can pass any budget it chooses, and our government already pays for everything by creating new money.”* In other words, fuck everything, print money. Mr. Mosler, please let us know how your governor’s race went… oh, you lost. Fuck you and fuck your Post-Keynesian economics. The Consulier GTP was ugly and so are your numbers. I’m out of energy. This is stupid. They’re going to be able to get it all moved forward by 2100 but the moment they take more money from my pocket, and that’s from the pocket of a small business owner who has more than 25 employees under him and two companies running, with a third hopefully moving forward sometime next year, I’m giving the fuck up and going to work for someone.

What is the ideal executive branch in a Libertarian’s mind?,Libertarian,"I personally don’t believe in the idea of a “president.” The fact that one man or woman essentially controls an entire branch of government obviously has its problems. You can say “checks and balances”, but Congress has ceded more and more authority to the President with every administration. I’d say checks and balances are moot since the president has declared every war-erm-engagement since WWII. I know as Libertarians we obviously support scaling back the bureaucracy, but what would the ideal executive branch look like to y’all? I would support a body like the Senate replacing the presidential office, and making the executive branch unicameral with just a proportionally representative house. The executive senate would appoint a “first among equals” with no actual executive authority outside of the majority’s consent, similar to Westminster Parliament. As it stands I think the Executive body is broken and carries too much power. Trump’s willing to strong arm anything to get his way, and on top of that the idea that a President “runs the country” has created dangerous cults of personality around the office. Obama was seen as a savior for the working-class minority, and Trump is now the savior of working-class and rural white america. Economic illiterates attribute the false positives of the economy to Donald Trump, when in reality he has next to nothing to do with our day-to-day economic movement. Having one man serve as a figurehead of this country goes against everything this country is supposed to represent in my view. What do y’all think?

Not my cup of tea,Libertarian,"So, I've been learning about Libertarianism the past month. I've heard the word a lot, but never really looked into it. Just posting to say it is not my cup of tea, and I cannot imagine it every getting any significant number of votes in a modern society. The financial/business principles seem pretty sound: a strong free market, letting competition sort things out. But, as far as I can tell, most proponents of Libertarianism also advocate for an absence of laws regulations regarding social issues. Many L.'s appear to advocate: * No government-funded schools for children * No government-funded welfare for single mothers * No government-funded welfare for mentally handicapped or crippled people * No government-funded welfare for elderly who have no assets * No government prohibition against creating air pollution or water pollution * No police-enforced rules against hotels or restaurants refusing to serve, say, blacks or Jews * No police-enforced rules against animal cruelty * ... and the list goes on. My personal beliefs on whether government should regulate the above issues are not relevant. My point is that modern (prosperous) societies will never vote for Libertarian candidates that support those strict Libertarian social policies. The financial/business policies of the L's seem more palatable to voters, but even there I suspect that if Libertarians permitted monopolies to charge what they want (cable TV, pharmaceuticals, etc) L. politicians would get voted out of office very quickly.",aap0e6,self.Libertarian,,True

"The idea of being forced into a government building during your most impressionable years, came from 'Old World' Europe and wasn't fully shackled onto American children until around 1900 ~ Ron Paul",Libertarian,"While it may surprise a few people, compulsory government 'schooling' is not an American idea. The idea of being forced into a government building during your most impressionable years, came from 'Old World' Europe and wasn't fully shackled onto American children until around 1900. Not-coincidentally, this was the same time that the 'progressive' ideas of an all-powerful government really started to swallow up the land of the free. Today, the American federal government is the biggest that the world has ever seen, and it has a government-'educated' population that sheepishly accepts just about anything that it does. Compulsory 'education' is the crown jewel of government control. Fortunately, modern communication technologies are not only taking down government's other indoctrination tool (the Mainstream Media), but they're also enabling people to get their kids out of the government's 'education' grip. If you're interested in opting-out your children, the Ron Paul Curriculum may be the right homeschooling option for you. K-8 students get the basics: reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and history. There is also a year's course on personal finance, saving, investing, and the dangers of debt.

Thoughts on Corporate Political Donations,Libertarian,"Just wanted to hear your guys' thoughts on one of Elizabeth Warren's recent proposals. It stated that a corporation could only make political donations if 75% of shareholders voted to do so. The bill has a lot of other proposals but this is really the only one I agree with and want to break down, let me explain why. In 2010 Citizens United ruled that corporations are artificial people. Shareholders make up this 'person' so shouldn't the shareholders be in large agreement as to whether they make political donations? And a lot of people might say well in a free market investors can just invest elsewhere but I dont think this considers that corporations can donate money anonymously to political campaigns and when you're talking about a multi billion dollar company I'm sure shareholders typically dont look twice at a $300k anonymous donation. Yet it's important because the shareholders are the technical owners. What are your guys' thoughts? Warning: I am by no means a 'pure' libertarian but I do lean that direction, I believe that ending the war on drugs, abolishing the department of education, abolishing the ATF, abolishing the DEA, etc. That being said I absolutely still believe the government should play a role, marginal one albeit, but still a role in the economy and in public welfare.

General Mattis has shown his true colors,Libertarian," So it seems Secretary of Defense General Mattis and Mike Pompeo briefed the Senate last week about khashoggi saying there was no direct evidence and to please not withdraw support for our friends in Saudi Arabia over some silly incident. General Mattis was the one person on trump's team who has always been universally praised as the 'adult in the room' and the one who will stand up to Trump if he goes over the line. Because Trump has filled his team with neocons like Bolton and Pompeo, Mattis is the only one preventing trump from invading Iran and starting ww3. Well I've said this before and now we can't deny it. General Mattis is a neocon piece of shit that won't let a little journalist or for that matter a few million starving children get in the way of his war. I'm sure it has everything to do with 'national security' and nothing to do with his friends in the Military Industrial Complex whom he worked for prior to reentering the public sector in the Trump administration. Even in this sub I'm probably gonna get crucified for saying this but I think it needs to be said that anyone who has lasted this long in the trump administration without being fired is a tool and an enabler for the president's worst tendencies.

Egalitarianism is a leftist disease- the case for libertarian fascism monarchism,Libertarian,"Egalitarianism implies we are all equal, which is false. Men are physically stronger than women. Women are less aggressive and violent than men. Male brains are more analytical and logically oriented where as female brains are more emotional and nurturing. This is why traditional gender roles are good for society, as if we aren’t all equal, having everyone in a hierarchal role legislated by a monarch will ensure that society is able to maximize its production from workers. This is beneficial to people in all roles, even the peasants who exist to solely serve the noble castes. In order for the monarch to provide liberty for all, he must use his absolute power to maintain the hierarchical structure of society, suppress all degenerate lifestyles and beliefs (lgbtq advocacy, BLM, antifa, socialism, democrats, pedophiles, druggies, prostitutes, etc). If the monarch doesn’t do this, than society would collapse or become overrun by authoritarian SJWs, so in order to maintain a libertarian society fascist methods must be adopted to force liberty on the people, as people tend to dislike liberty due to MSM brainwashing, so liberty must be shoved down their throats by a fascist monarch.

The viet-Minh and viet-Kong were supplied by the Soviet Union, China or by stealing or buying weapons from the enemy. The Communist Chinese stole there guns from the Nationalists or Japanese. The Mujahideen were supplied by the Pakistanis, Muslims countries and US government. Even in the case of the American revolution.

The 'it's a private company' argument with regards to social media censorship is extremely oversimplified,Libertarian,"We've all heard it, whenever the issue of social media companies censoring right-wing opinions comes up, the response from your standard liberal Reddit NPC would be: 'it's a private company, they can do what they want'. Well firstly, that's ironic coming from the same people who love to fear-monger about internet companies censoring and throttling certain types of traffic. Apparently business freedom is only important when it works in their favour. Secondly, and more importantly, it's a grossly misleading statement with regards to how US law actually treats the issue of free speech on social media sites. They are legally protected from libel lawsuits because they are ostensibly neutral platforms where the ideas discussed and shared are solely that of the users. When they start trying to dictate which political beliefs are and aren't okay, and banning those who step out of line, then they are no longer a neutral platform. They are 'curating' certain opinions for lack of a better term, and would be viewed no differently from news companies. In other words, Reddit would lose their protections and would be held liable for untruthful statements made by their users. I'm sure you can imagine what a shitshow that would be, so yes, there is a *de facto* legal requirement for social media companies not to censor certain opinions. ",a3hppa,self.Libertarian,,True

I was thinking of a compromise??? Thoughts and criticisms?,Libertarian,"What if we had the ability to choose tax 'levels' based on our individual preference. For example, the minimum tax level would be an extremely low percentage and pays for things such as infrastructure, military, and police. Then the second level goes up in tax percentage but has more government-provided services. Then the tax levels would increase more and more based on a citizen's preference. This would allow for libertarians and conservatives to be happy with having low taxes but not being able to access most government services that those in higher levels get to. The key is that your tax level is a percentage of your income and not based on an amount you choose to contribute.

Suggestions on decent libertarian Youtubers?,Libertarian,"For a while now, I've been following FreedomToons, John Stossel, Ron Paul's Liberty Report, and even Dave Rubin. But I'm looking for something fresh, because these channels became very stale and feels 'unhealthy' at best. I'll go down 1 by 1. **Rubin Report:** I got into David Rubin long time ago because I couldn't really find a 'decent' talk show starring libertarian or even conservative figures (maybe except JRE). It was just so rare. But as I kept watching, Dave Rubin seems to have become this *yes man* to his guests, and always harbors around demonizing generalizing the left entirely around SJWs, socialists, and 'muh regressive left'. **FreedomToons:** Similar to David Rubin. He generalizes the left as entirely composed of SJWs, and most of the time demonizes Democrats, and glorifies lots of conservatives and Republican figures. The best part of this channel if there is, I'd have to say it is *The Debunkers* series, but that is still half-decent at best. He goes after low hanging fruits like *NowThis* or Hasan Piker (anyone with a functioning brain and google can debunk them easily). As of right now, the state of his channel has become more towards a maga-tarian perspective, where his biggest weapon against anyone left leaning is SJWs or *Vuvuzela*. **John Stossel:** Better than the previous 2, but still generalizes and mis-characterizes left-wing figures sometimes. I can see he really tries to be non-partisan (when it comes to Dems or Republicans), for example, he critisizes Lindsey Graham or Nancy Pelosi for being citizen-spying warmongers, and on other occasions, he praises the action of Elizabeth Warren on defending free speech on campus, or California Attorney George Gascon dropping over 3000 marijuana convictions. Pretty cool overall, but a little too much of a climate change denier I have to say. **Ron Paul:** By far the best libertarian channel I've seen so far. Yes, definitely shows biases in his talking points, but really sticks to his libertarian philosophy all the time. I likey. I've seen plenty of Youtube channels within the libertarian-left realm, such as Secular Talk, David Pakman (meh), Jimmy Dore, and recently PoliDice, just to name a few, but I haven't really seen much of independent lib-right Youtubers. Any suggestions would help a lot.",aa7n4u,self.Libertarian,,True

Possible excuse for property tax? (a negative rights look into government as a mediator),Libertarian,"I’ve spent a good bit of the past few months researching Marxism due to the CTH brigades constantly espousing socialism/communism on this sub and others which I regular. I wanted to understand their view more fully so I could properly give responses that they might find convincing (or at least find a common vocabulary if definitions). In doing so, I found that several of Marx’s critiques of capitalism are fair and valid points; the issue with Marx is not his critiques, but his suggested authoritarian solutions! I’ve put it in my mind to find libertarian minded solutions to the critiques. I’m not going to claim any expertise in this field (I’m a biology major, not a political philosopher) and so I’m looking for critiques to the ideas I’ve been mulling over; this is obviously going to include flawed logic. However, here is my first attempt at dealing with potential abuses property rights: We can all recognize the potential of unregulated accumulation of land and natural resources as becoming monopolistic due to natural market process. A libertarian response is that such monopolies cannot be inherently abusive, because they can only charge what the consumer is willing to pay, however this somewhat ignores that if half the population can afford a exorbitant price of (food, water, energy, etc) yet the other portion can not afford this price, the monopoly may unethically continue charging that price, and violate the rights of the poorer portion of the population to not be killed. Perhaps this is one of the few places in which market mediation is ethical? If so, how can the market be mediated without infringing on the negative rights of the property owners? What if we use a constitutionally limited government structure, but have it funded by fees/tax only on the value of land? Right away, I’m resistant to this idea, but what if the theoretical basis is that the owner owes some type of compensation to all those deprived of access to that section of purchased land, because the land itself is not produced by human effort, and therefore the land itself (not anything built on it or stored on it) should really be something more like a commons area. This theory would be that land and resources are “rented” from the general population, securing the renter’s contract with a payment to the previous owner of the rental contract. It would be defining property as the right to exclusively control whatever one has labored to create, and/or whatever one has purchased or rented. Perhaps one could say that in purchasing a lot, the user agreement could include a tax? Introducing such a policy could then not effect any land purchased prior to the policy emplacement; meaning this tax could only apply to new land purchases. The government that this funds obviously must have a very limited scope of powers. Any thoughts, critiques, or relevant resources materials for this line of thinking?",a5w6nr,self.Libertarian,,True

"New to Libertarianism, where should I start?",Libertarian,"Since I started paying attention to politics I've always considered myself a conservative. I loved liberty, but because of some strong conservative social values, I couldn't bring myself to make the leap to libertarianism. Now as I've grown less religious much of those values have changed, and I'm now far more interested in libertarianism than conservatism. I was wondering what books, philosophers, etc. I should be checking out to get a deeper understanding of the ideology. I know a bit about the stances of libertarians on current issues, but very little about the philosophy those stances rest on (outside of the non-aggression principle).

But how is this possible? It seems very odd that this site claims that I'm Libertarian but I disagree with the Libertarian Party a whopping 60% of the time, so what's going on? I assume this is because the Libertarian Party of America has a very slight tint to the right while I practically broke the scale with how left I was, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm nearly parallel with them on the Libertarian/Authoritarian scale.",a6s2q4,self.Libertarian,,True

Take reddit for example: with a prominent Liberal bias on the front page, I always try to stick up for the minority Conservative voices that all too often get downvoted (even if they're stating facts with citations). Another example is discussing politics with my Conservative friends or family: I try to make them see why Liberals might feel the way they do, and go to the extent of defending some Liberal ideologies.

We Need To Redesign What We Tolerate From the Healthcare Industry,Libertarian,"I know free healthcare is a big topic in politics, but I think instead of covering cost we should reevaluate how things are done. I recently obtained my medical marijuana license, it was a $200 appointment and $50 prescription. I knew in a year I would have to get the card renewed for $150, but I did not know every 60 days I would have to cough over $50 to keep my prescription. The local news have been outraged by this as well saying it seemed immoral, unethical and like a scam. However that is exactly like it is. I have been on the same medicine for blood pressure for 6 years. Every 3 months I have to go to a doctor, they make me do blood test once a year with a separate appointment and come back to read it over only to find nothing because it's all 'normal'. I've been through 7 different PCPs and the best I can get is 6 months at a time. Where is my lifetime prescription? Why am I having to constantly go back for the same thing? Then when I go to a new doctor I just hand them a sticky note and say 'this is what I've been on, it's working, I just need you to write the script'. All because society accepts that their 8 year degree over rides what I should be able to get on my own over the counter. I'm a grown ass person, I've been in my body for all these decades and know what works. We idolize them with all these TV shows but even witch doctors knew the right herbs to gather. Don't get me wrong there are some great Doctors, but 85% of them are in it for themselves, they want that money, they want to pay off their loans and feel society owes them that. They even go as far as jumping to crazy expensive procedures because they think it might be this very rare thing they 'read' about and it's the only way to be sure. Why do we put up with this? Why is it easier for me to tell my Boss I have to take a day off to go to a Doctor than it is to tell the Doctor I need to postpone the appointment until I have some PTO again. Why the fuck are they only open during the hours the rest of the world is working? You go in for stomach ulcers and they tell you it is okay to go home and eat a bowl of jalapenos??? I get that they make their money from us being sick but that is just stupid. You go in for a stiff back and rather then give you a cortisone shot for $400 they want you to get a $20,000 MRI. How are those test so much still? Surely that equipment is paid off by now. You go in for what was suppose to be a 3 day treatment and they baker act you for 2 weeks to milk your insurance. Telling you if you leave you will never be able to go back to that hospital again, even when it's the only one in town. We can pay for people to get this shit treatment all day, but it is money down the drain when the Doctor's are running around calling their own shots and we just roll over and take it, with no negotiation.",a72rko,self.Libertarian,,True

This issue is the United States' debt crisis We as libertarians all know that taxation and regulation should be minimized as much as possible, but with the situation the federal government is in at the moment, with Trump's tax cuts just contributing to our deficit (Even though we bounced back and closed our yearly deficit by a huge margin in the later Obama years) Do you guys believe we should cut spending?

The idea of raising taxes is of course very anti-libertarian, but If you're in support of spending cuts, where would you cut spending, and if you're in support of tax hikes, where would you raise them?

The way I figure it, quitting my job wouldn't change the system, the system is what it is and as long as it is what it is its not hypocritical to take advantage of what my taxpayer dollars are being forced to fund just like its not hypocritical to drive on roads.

So you'd have the school rep, and the sports rep, and the scientists rep, and so on. Plus reps from each section of the city (call them 'districts', some cities use that, others use townships, some are so big they use counties...). &#x200B; We brought up that maybe some leniency would be given for visitors and new arrivals (I'll add- if the law isn't one of the obvious ones like theft, fraud, murder). Not 'you didn't know so there's no consequences' but 'you didn't know, so lesser punishment.' &#x200B; This is the raw idea, but let's refine it. I like it.

By pulling out we give up any chance of influencing the outcome of this conflict. Our European allies aren’t equipped well enough to handle this on our own. And this would completely abandon what allies we do have on the ground. I find it funny that when Mueller’s investigation seems to be coming down on Trump hard, trump suddenly and out of no where pulls shit like this, without consulting anybody.

What Will The Libertarian Party Do Different?,Libertarian,"Now is the time that we, as a society, need to seriously discuss reproductive controls.

We are about to end up with an unemployment problem like we have never seen and the time to do something about it is now, before it becomes a problem. Step 0: Free, government provided permanent and semi-permanent (IUD, implant, etc) birth control for anyone who wants it. Programs to encourage young people to get it done. We should be doing this anyway. Step 1: Receiving government benefits due to lack of income? Fine, but you can't vote while you are drawing those benefits or for 2 years afterwards. Voting should be reserved for members of society that produce value. Step 2: Drawing benefits because you can't afford to care for your child? Mandatory IUD for the mom, and semi-permanent BC for the dad. Have another kid afterwards and still need support? Get those tubes tied first.

Question regarding libertarian principles vs practical policies,Libertarian,"Okay so obviously, things like universal healthcare are non-liberation policies. If a liberation government came into power, I would never expect them to try to implement them (assuming they weren't already in place). However, if a libertarian government came into power in a country that has these policies (e.g. Canada, vast majority of Europe) and has a population that by and large supports and accepts them, should the libertarian government try to eliminate them? On a conceptual level, I would assume yes simply because they are anti-libertarian policies, but on a practical level, you'd be taking away people's healthcare - something that people would probably not be too happy about. Thoughts? &#x200B; Edit: For the sake of discussion, I'm assuming that the libertarian would be come into power, despite it being unlikely (as others have pointed out) given that the population supports universal healthcare or some other non-libertarian policy.",a6g6xv,self.Libertarian,,True

Smart Reddit Admin is Smart,Libertarian,"Regardless of your position on the  by u/rightc0ast, you have to admit this is a genius move by the Reddit admin. This sub is the only completely uncensored political forum on the site (read: last obstacle before reaching utopia). The sub is resistant to being directly quarantined because there's no argument to be made that the sub officially condones anything other than unoffensive Libertarianism. By allowing the troll hordes to change the sub rules without consent of the mods, the admins can't lose: if the new rules agree with their politics they win, and if the new rules don't agree the sub now officially condones something quarantine-worthy. This is also smart from a divide-and-conquer perspective: I suspect almost all the Libertarians on this sub would like the sub to continue without banning any politics. The new policy splits the Libertarians into two camps: those who are willing to accept political bans (potentially with the expectation they be unbanned afterward) to allow removal of the new system, and those who cannot condone such a thing. Both positions have very persuasive arguments (to Libertarians) in their favor, so this encourages the Libertarians to focus on debating each other rather than opposing the new system. In the interest of fairness, perhaps this new system was proposed in good faith and it's a coincidence that it seems perfect to facilitate censorship on this sub. Disclaimers: This post is not meant to advocate for anything. I have opinions about what should be done, of course, but I have intentionally kept them out of this post. What do you all think about the situation at hand? Do you think that this will be a turning point for the sub, marking the start of censorship, or is this a storm in a teacup?

Every time you scream socialism, or communism when its actually authoritarianism, people from those ideologies ignore you. They call it not real communism/socialism. And in some ways they are right. For example many call capitalism we have to day not real capitalism, or 'Crony Capitalism' because its been perverted by authoritarianism.

If they don't, they face $10 million dollars in fines.** This is already on top of Snowden-level **legal** government wiretapping in the Data Retention bill passed last year: 'Metadata from our phone calls, text messages, emails, and internet activity is now tracked by the government and accessible by intelligence and law enforcement agencies ... telecommunications companies are required to store customer metadata for at least two years'. Experts are worried not only about the future restriction of freedom but also the fact that backdoors could very easily be exploited by criminals and external government agencies - once you break encryption, you break encryption. &#x200B; Not to mention **NO freedom of speech laws in Australia,** **NO judicial oversight, and potential warrantless access for this many government agencies:**  All to stop the rampant terrorist suicide bombings and mass murder in our country.

What is the Libertarian solution for the Flint Water crisis?,Libertarian,"Please bear with me on this possibly terrible question, it's a bit difficult for me to understand Libertarianism.

The Flint water crisis happened when Flint's water supply changed from Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the Flint River, and it turns out the lead pipes and shitty water treatment made the water undrinkable and it won't be drinkable until all the lead pipes are replaced. What's the Libertarian alternative? &#x200B; What if, going outside the realm of what's currently happening, Coke repeats it's bullshit and buys the Flint water bed or whatever like it essentially has for some Mexican towns ( - wouldn't the ideals of Libertarianism dictate that if Coke owns the land that has the water, then Coke is free to decide not to do anything like letting people just have water at the risk of fewer people drinking Coke (even though Coca-Cola is seizing the land/water to make Coca-Cola).

A Question Regarding Social Security,Libertarian,"I’m failing to understand the core of what social security is. Politically, I want government out of things as much as possible. When looking at social security I truly don’t understand why government is involved. My thinking boils down to one question: Why is the government taking money from me and telling me when to use my money? From my perspective this seems to rid a person of financial responsibility and replaces it with government reliance. Could a person not just invest in a 10 or 30 year treasury bond or put that money in their savings? Why must I take my hard earned money and put it in the hands of the government? The only way I can understand why they are taking money from me is not because this is an investment of my money but rather a way for my money to be used on other people. Now I understand that the goal of social security is one of humanitarianism. We all agree that the sick and elderly shouldn’t have to suffer financially. The disagreement is the means used to achieve that goal. Once again, I’m not trying to act like I understand social security. I’m 19 and I don’t have a job. The thing is that I fail to understand SS even when I’m not having money taken from me. This is a serious question and I hope that I don’t offend anyone. I hope people understand that this question isn’t born out of ill will or intent but rather curiosity and interest. I also hope that I’m not viewed as heartless. Freedom for an individual is the most important thing for me. As one of my favorite economists, Milton Friedman said, “A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.”",a288yh,self.Libertarian,,True
'Waterworld',Libertarian,"Well I seem to annoy most with my comments, perhaps I should just tell old sea tales, so as people might understand how I got this messed up... So in the twilight of my career an old boss called me about a job. He was my captain for 13 seasons, seining salmon, in Alaska. He was also my high school algebra teacher and a pretty good all-around guy. When he called about running his fish boat, I wasn't too thrilled, I've had too much education in hard ships and Alaska is no place for old men. When he said tuna fishing in Hawaii...well that's a little different... Turns out all I needed was safety drill certification, endangered species training, US citizenship and someone to trust me with about a million dollars worth of boat, gear and crew. I'd never longlined before but I was told I just had to run the boat (and keep it running), manage the crew, find fish and the crew would catch'em. The crew were 'professionals' from the Philippines. Most of the crews were 'detained aliens' from the Philippines, Indonesia or Polynesia. It could cost over $10,000 in fees and expenses to get a 'detained alien' crewman. The salaries ranged from $350 to $750 a month. That doesn't sound like much but the families of those crewmen lived upper middle class lifestyles...at home. Hawaii is a nice place to visit but I hadn't realized that a tuna trip could last over a month. That's a long time to be out of sight of land and finding American crew was next to impossible. The 'detained aliens' were true professionals and had worked all over the world. Nobody has more absolute power than a captain out in 'Waterworld'. The real issue is a willingness to take absolute responsibility. If something goes wrong, 'you're on your own son' because no one has to come help. You're always on 'alert'. Being that responsible is nerve wracking and draining. At a port security meeting with FBI, CBP, USCG and fish boat captains, we were told to carry weapons, preferably semi-auto long guns, with extended magazines. Living on a boat and doing a dangerous job, can really cut the bullshit out of relationships and you get to know each other pretty good. I was amazed the lives my crew had lived and how lucky I was to be an American citizen. I'd led a rugged life but nobody had ever beat me at work. I'd been hungry before (you wouldn't know it to look at me:) but no one had ever withheld food from me. When someone equates paying taxes to slavery, I have think they've never seen someone whose employers beat them. When I see someone who wants NO authority, I think someone has never been threatened. I don't like authority but I know we have to have some, to be civilized (but smaller is better). Normally I wouldn't give a shit what someone believes or what someone does, as long as it's not harming others. BUTT By corrupting libertarianism with right/left or anarcho ideologies you lessen the chance getting rid of authoritarianism. So if I seem short or terse, this is a big deal to me, sorry if your feeling get hurt. ",a4qz83,self.Libertarian,,True
Nationalism,Libertarian,"First and foremost, I’d like to establish that I’m a firm believer in individualism rather than holding a collectivist mindset about one’s nation. That being said, I fail to understand the problem with nationalism rom a libertarian perspective. Maybe I’m not fully sure what nationalism is. White nationalism seems to be the new core belief of Nazism according to the MSM. I’m not inherently proud of myself for being white but there are accomplishments that white people have made to be proud of. That being said, white people tend to collectivize themselves by ancestral heritage rather than race anyway. I just don’t see the logic in being a white nationalist but I could see the bigotry in thinking your race is automatically superior to another simply for the accomplishments of others. Being an American nationalist, on the other hand, seems to be a good thing. Americans love touting that were the greatest nation in the world. That can be disputed but to be demonized for believing it seems overboard. It just seems like patriotism to me and why wouldn’t you be proud of America? Government ideals aside, we as a nation have accomplished more than any other civilization has in the history of the world. Isn’t that cause enough to think we’re clearly a better nation than Nigeria or Romania? Not to say Nigerians or Romanians are subhumans to Americans but our country is more accomplished than there’s. So why do people, libertarians in particular, denounce nationalism so vehemently? Hopefully I got my point across well enough for someone to explain it to me as I’ve had this question for a while.

A question about what actual libertarian America would be like from the beginning,Libertarian,"I've been thinking about how libertarianism would affect cares industries and laws, etc. But lately it's occurred to me that all almost all the discussions are about what it would be like to 'switch' to a more libertarian model from the current setup. My question is simply, if the ideal libertarian policies that most of this sub wants were implemented right there at the founding of the USA, do you think that the general course of the country would be unchanged? I feel like so many things that we have today thanks to capitalism, regulations, and taxes are taken for granted in a post modern libertarian society. I feel like certain improvements in life wouldn't necessarily have happened if the government was closer to whatever the average of libertarian ideals are. Various pollution regulations, the ending of slavery (in a somewhat timely manner), the highway system, etc. I can imagine some of the bad things not happening as well, especially revolving around participation in wars.

The State of /r/Libertarian or: What the hell is going on?,Libertarian,"# Question: What the hell is happening in /r/Libertarian? &#x200B; # Timeline Answer: /r/Libertarian entered a sort of polling system where 'more active' (more comments, posts, etc) users would have more points with which to vote. The potential fault of this system is that these polls can be marked as *governance polls*, wherein the mods would have to auto-enact any of the *governance polls* that reach a certain voting threshold (this would be enforced by Reddit admins as far as I understand). As a result, there were many community votes in the early stages where the **majority of people** voted one way, but the **majority of points** voted in another. There were fears from many users that this would allow trolls or brigadiers to use the polling system to perform a hostile takeover of /r/Libertarian. However, there was some support that the system could be a way for users to curtail mod power abuse. &#x200B; /u/rightc0ast believed this discrepancy to be a result of brigading. **Brigading is not so uncommon from either T\_D (right-wing subreddit) and CTH (left-wing subreddit).** /u/rightc0ast **began to ban many users, notably left-wing users.** After the bans, the pollings began to run to 'normal' (whatever that means) to some degree. Most notably, there was an enacted poll that the community points system would be removed. &#x200B; /u/rightc0ast has promised to unban people once the community points system has been removed, but many of the users have began to distrust him. Many have begun to call for him to step down from the moderator position. &#x200B; # Two Narratives: There seems to be two prevailing narratives: 1. **The narrative in support of** /u/rightc0ast**.** He has been a faithful moderator for many years (I think) and there was absolutely something fuck-y going on. The bannings were important so that brigadiers (left or right wing, it doesn't matter) would not take over the subreddit. After all of this, things will return to normal, and, hopefully, /r/Libertarian goes back to its regular self. 2. **The narrative against** /u/rightc0ast**.** The bannings absolutely occurred. Many of the users that were banned were left-wing, so there is a fear that /u/rightc0ast is on a 'power trip' of sorts. Censorship is inherently anti-free-speech. If not all of the users are unbanned, /u/rightc0ast will have managed to shape discussion on /r/Libertarian. Without us even knowing, he'll have begun taking over this subreddit. Edit: He was also a moderator in /r/physicalremoval (an alt-right subreddit). &#x200B; **tl;dr: Admins implemented a shit system inherently vulnerable to brigading. A mod began to ban people.

Does withdrawing from Syria and Afghanistan make Trump the best President of the 21st century (excluding Clinton's one year)?,Libertarian,"I strongly dislike the president. I obviously voted for Johnson in 2016, but at the time if I were forced to choose between Trump and Clinton, I would've chosen Clinton. Trump is just as fiscally irresponsible as Bush and Obama. The tariffs are a whole new level of dumb, which is something we didn't have in Bush's or Obama's administration, but we also got new income tax cuts + huge corporate tax cuts. Also, the rule of getting rid of two regulations for every new regulation is a step in the right direction. We have not busted out any stimulus packages to the level of Bush or Obama, so I'd call it about even economically, maybe the slightest of edges to Trump economically. Socially he's been awful. No transgenders in the military, global warming doesn't exist, the wall, bump stock ban, the news is the enemy of the people, etc. We can chalk up a huge L for Trump. Though Obama and Bush have weak social policy records as well, from Obama politicizing every shooting and trying to use it to push his gun control measures, to Bush's campaign against gay marriage (that Obama fully supported until he knew he could jump on board to help his 2012 campaign), to Obama's record deportations, to Bush's war on stem cell research, etc. I think it's fair to say all three had awful social policy, though Obama probably has a slight edge here. On to foreign policy and I mean holy shit. Bush invaded Afghanistan with zero plan and then started a war in Iraq for no reason. The atrocities in both wars, mainly Iraq are unforgivable. Then Obama comes in, pulls out of Iraq, then goes back in, accelerates Afghanistan, and then starts a war in Syria and Libya. Now here Trump is talking about how we need to stop being the world's police, stop funding other countries, and then vows to end Afghanistan and Syria out of the middle of no where. Ending the wars in Afghanistan, Syria, and potentially Iraq would be no doubt the best foreign policy moves of the 21st century, maybe ever? Obviously there's not much competition between Bush and Obama, and all three have been/are currently horrendous presidents, but with the pull out from Syria and Afghanistan this makes me wonder - is President Trump the best president of the 21st century?",aa01h5,self.Libertarian,,True

What are your opinions on the concept of percentage based fines.,Libertarian,"Posted this over at r/Classical_Liberals but didn't get much input, thought it might be more fitting here. I've been thinking for a while about the concept of a percentage based Fine for things like parking, breaking the speed limit etc etc. In these scenarios fines are used as a way to discourage those actions. Now, I don't want to sound like a socialist, but I'm sure we can see the issue of this when we look at wage distribution. To a wealthy individual, a 100$ parking fee is nothing, but to a poorer individual, a 100$ parking fee could be a significant financial hit. My point here is that the discouragement levels are not the same, it's much worse for a poor person to be caught with a fine than a wealthy person, and so the wealthy person is potentially not sufficently discouraged from committing these actions. You can see examples of this in the ultra-rich, I remember a news story about some CEO (Apple I think) who didn't have a number plate on his car, and simply paid the fine whenever it came up - perhaps is is a rather benign example, however it does raise the question of whether fines are effective in their current incarnation. My question from here is how do we mitigate that while remaining 'fair' - the obvious solution is a fine based on a percentage of income. Somehow it feels wrong though, but I cant put my finger on why. Would it be a good way to raise government income without raising taxes? Why is it not implemented already? Am I missing some way that it's unfair or infringes on the rights of the individual?",a6o30x,self.Libertarian,,True

The mods overreacted in a way that is counter to this subreddit's values - an analysis on community points and mod power abuse,Libertarian,"Before I start, I do want to say I don't think the community point system would work well here either. However, the mod reaction to the point system, which was to ban people they didn't like, was a far greater disservice to this community and the values it purports to have - one of free speech and not banning people for their ideologies. &#x200B; The way the community point system works is that you get more points for being upvoted and being active in the subreddit. Community points are then used to weight your votes in polls. Polls are also only binding if they reach a 5% threshold. That means that there needs to be 5 million community points voted for a particular option for a poll to be enacted. &#x200B; This also means that only active participants in the subreddit have governance power. Random brigades are downvoted by the community here and so have no power in polls. &#x200B; Well, what if a subreddit brigades and upvotes a bunch of their stuff, you may ask? The community here will also be counteracting brigades by downvoting content. There has also been no evidence of any successful brigade attempts to this subreddit. &#x200B; But what about /u/HTownian25? According to /u/rightc0ast they managed to sway a poll by 8%! And they post on ChapoTrapHouse! Well first of all, they're not really a brigader, htownian is an extremely active member of this community, even if an antagonistic one. Their point total is 525K. That means they alone do not have enough voting power to make any changes. If htownian25 tries to get their friends to help they do not have enough voting power to actually make any polls do anything. We also have to remember that members of this community will also vote against any terrible polls. From a brief glance most active posters range between 80k-200k points. While yes, the discrepancy in voting power seems far too large and is a problem in itself, there is still no actual threat of any bad polls from being enacted. &#x200B; We can see clear evidence that the community was against any terrible polls as well: One which should have been a landslide if the brigade had any power to ban a right wing user here:  &#x200B; &#x200B; /u/rightc0ast (who is extremely right wing), in a frenzy, decides to ban a bunch of users whose views he did not agree with. Their excuse for this was that left wing users may brigade the subreddit and force through bad polls. As I explained earlier - this is extremely unlikely to happen. It also shows that the moderators of this subreddit do not trust us as a community to govern ourselves. &#x200B; The bans made include /u/HTownian25 whose only crime was to not share the same political beliefs as rightc0ast and daring to participate in a poll for a community which they are an active member of. This mod also went against the aforementioned poll regarding banning users (that banning users was banned) - which shows that the mods will contradict poll results anyway and thus making the fear of brigaders doing anything through polls meaningless anyway. &#x200B; The mods decided that it was a good idea to ban people based on their political ideologies, going against some of the core tenants of this subreddit, because they were afraid of something happening even though there was little chance of it happening. To quote another one of the posts trending on this subreddit: 'Is freedom more important than safety?' Apparently, according to the mods, no it isn't. &#x200B; &#x200B;",a29er3,self.Libertarian,,True

So I wanna talk about the libertarian community,Libertarian," I have been a libertarian( Anarcho Capitalist) for almost a year now, and i have noticed that the movement is not equally succesful across the globe as it is here in Brazil. In recent years it has been the one that grows the most, mainly due to the fact that we have a sort of a pioneer in the brazillian YouTube named 'Ideas Radicais', that has more than 500,000 subscribers. Rafael, the owner of the channel has a unique way of making his videos, in which he talks about recent events in socio-political aspect, but with an AnCap view. He also has videos casually but effectively explaining the fundaments of the philosofy and ethics of the libertarians. It,s important the notice that Brazil is a country that has massive poverty, terrifying amount of regulations, taxes, interventionism, keynesianism (all the crap that pushes the world backwards), so a favourable environment for the sprout of a pro-freedom movement also takes place here. With all of that Brazil in half a decade (optimistically speaking) will be in a much and increasingly better spot than most other countries.

How Stupid Does One Have To Be To Believe Ron Paul Is A Racist?,Libertarian,"It seems every time Ron Paul is mentioned in a post, some asshat comes along, quotes Paul's old newsletter and attributes it to Ron. Ron Paul has refuted these statements, took responsibility for them and apologized that they came out during his watch. Then they might bring up the CRA. Ron didn't agree with the small portion, of the CRA, that dealt with the behavior of citizens. Most of the CRA deals with limiting the government's role in racism, Ron's always liked reining in the government. Ron Paul is probably best known for his wanting to stop foreign wars, the MIC, the 'drug wars', and crony capitalism. Ron first ran for president in 1988. If Ron had won, 'marched the troops home' and if the drug war was stopped, then Ron would have benefited more POC, all over the world, then any US president in history. What is his motive if he's a racist, white supremacist? If you're going to accuse people shouldn't you provide a motive for their action? What kind of outrageous conspiracy theory explains the 'ideologically consistent' (Jon Stewart), 'Dr No''s actions? I asked the people who where accusing Ron, what his motive would have been but got no response. I think I know the accusers motive though. They're elitists, they've spent more on education that most of the world will make in a lifetime. They've used racism and privilege, so they assume all other white people use racism and privilege. They never learned not to respect races, sexes or religions over others and if you don't respect their favored groups over others, you're a bigot. I'll ask again, IF Ron Paul is a racist white supremacist, what's his motive to trying to benefit millions of minority lives? ",a3epsi,self.Libertarian,,True

Just want to say I'm thankful for the change in moderation around here.,Libertarian,"I've seen several posts complaining about the new moderation policy and thought I'd chip in on the other side. IMO popular level libertarianism (I know that is straining the idea of 'popular') has been in trouble since the Johnson/Weld ticket attempted to redefine libertarianism in a way that served their thin political chances. Specifically, that redefinition was aimed at Bernie Bros who, mistakenly believing that Johnson/Weld were advocating actual libertarian ideology, falsely came to believe their own socialistic/leftist bent was compatible with libertarianism. And while actual libertarianism isn't right or left in the sense of U.S. politics it is even less compatible with socialism and the authoritarian 'progressive' movement that is so much a part of the U.S. political landscape. This sub got over-run by faux libertarians, people who didn't care to learn the ideological tradition, and other various despisers of libertarianism. I think all that resulted in a need to moderate in a way that the main libertarian sub on Reddit was a place where actual libertarian thought can be expressed without being shouted down/downvoted by people who either hate libertarianism or self-identify with libertarianism under false conclusions. Not that actual libertarian thought has to be automatically agreed with around here; I hope non-libertarians can continue to learn about the ideology (as is traditional around here).

Those who use marijuana are more than twice as likely to end up on heroin than a non marijuana user, which suggests that the gateway drug phenomenon is real. How does this maximize average liberty for society in any way whatsoever? All marijuana legalization would do is worsen the opioid epidemic, increase reliance on the welfare state, and increase incarceration rates (there is evidence that lower IQ correlates with predisposition towards violent criminal behavior). To pay for this, the government would have to raise taxes, which is theft and violates the NAP, but it would be the only way to cover the societal cost of legalizing marijuana. Therefore, marijuana legalization is actually a big government program designed to reduce liberty, which is why it is part of the Democrat platform, and is why marijuana should be illegal.",a7qdsf,self.Libertarian,,True

I noticed that the last couple of months there's been more spam (I think many of you have mentioned the same). So I wrote an article about how I thought people should be limited to only a couple of posts a day with unlimited comments. IF (really big if) I write a quality article that garners a lot of interest, I can be kept busy all day defending those opinions and I certainly have no free time to play Sir Spamalot. Well the anarchists did seem to care for any of that. I tried to explain that everyone would still have unlimited free speech and everyone would have an equal exposure in the 'front page'. I don't like authority and I don't like telling others what to do. Still for some reason I was often placed in positions of authority... I learned that a certain amount of regulation and order was needed. Now the best way is to educate and empower those under you. If a society can set minimum limits, first, draconian measures won't be needed later. That's what happened here in r/Libertarian.

How do we know that the idea that free markets are the reason the world is getting better isn't just speculative?,Libertarian,"This is a good faith general question for libertarians. I just listened to a podcast from some guys at the the Cato Institute talking about all the progress humanity has made over the last 100 years to lift people out of poverty, increase life expectancy, increase global median income and other well-being indicators. And naturally they attribute this to increased economic and personal freedom. But the reality is most economies are not run according to libertarian principles and never have been; most are a mix of free markets with varying levels of regulation and state intervention. We know that China has contributed enormously to the impressive indicators of the last 50 years but I think it's too simplistic to say this proves that free markets should be allowed to run unfettered. While China has definitely allowed markets and entrepreneurs to flourish in recent decades, it has never had unfettered free markets, has a tightly regulated economy with significant state intervention and a growing welfare state. Similarly with the US and Europe - neither are nor have ever been libertarian paradises. How do we know freer markets would be better isn't just a speculative ideological posture? What data is there to suggest that freer markets would be better than free-ish markets with some regulation and government intervention in areas where markets are inefficient (eg healthcare)?",ab88hh,self.Libertarian,,True

Why are unions bad?,Libertarian,"I love coming here to you guys with these questions, because it really helps me think outside of the box that I have grown up with. &#x200B; With that said, one of the things I have heard a lot of Libertarians throwing shade at is the concept of Unions, but i do not understand why. It seems great, and just an extension of free speech. Eg. A factory with 100 workers in it. None of them particularly satisfied with their wages, but nobody hard balling wage negotiations because they know they are expendable. Now, one day a man on the floor, uses his free speech and decries 'I will not do this job for $12/hr it is not worth it' and he quits. Now, everyone on the floor heard this, and all of the people who make less than that will think they are being paid less than market value for their work (even if that one guy was just an outlier). They all get together and start talking, and decide to bargain collectively. At this point, a couple things can happen, and none of them seem bad: * The workers can demand that they be paid at least what that other guy was making, or they will quit. If the employer fires them, then new people will take their places. No net losses, no net gains by the union. * If the employer agrees, then many of the employees would have increased their wages. Obviously the company would then be spending more on production costs, and that would be reflected in the price of the product, and would be passed on to the consumer. But, as the price goes up, fewer people will purchase the product. So the net cash going to the company would remain roughly the same (theoretically) but more of the profits would be split with the people doing the work. That does not seem like a bad thing to me. Then of course, if the company is not cool with this, it can find new peeps. That is how the market should work. I can see why unions would be bad as they pertain to government work (as most thing with government seem to). Politicians would make policies to increase benefits for the unions to curry votes and favor. Then other politicians are unable to remove those benefits without pissing off a lot of voters. It is not in politician's best interest to negotiate with unions. ",a3ayzo,self.Libertarian,,True
Small government means America will be quickly left behind,Libertarian,"Wanted to start a discussion about how the small government that Libertarians want will actually do the greatest disservice to America in the years ahead, specifically as we attempt to compete with China. China is quickly passing us. They went from 90% of their citizens in extreme poverty in 1978 to less than 1% in extreme poverty today. They have more billionaires now, a larger GDP, and thriving industries. But these aren't the real story, nor the real threat. The real story is that the government of China is the true economic force.

I guess I'm confused on how such a society would realistically function.,Libertarian,"I was scrolling through the reddit front page, and saw an r/libertarian meme about roads and potholes and other government spending on it and decided to look a little more deeply at the subreddit itself. I was looking at community Info and saw the 'what about roads part' and how they can be seen as supporting certain corporations over others and so on so forth. Is there a better alternative though? If everyone were to build their own roads, that would cause major issue, someone could in theory buy up all the roads and screw everyone over and force people to pay, similar to government taxing us. Roads would be likely less organized than they already are, potholes may or may not be less common, depending on the localities response time and the quality of the road, which would also likely vary even more greatly. (Granted, this is quite anecdotal based off of some discussions with a family member who's a transportation. Furthermore, are taxes not needed to help run government? In the U.S, when the federal government was not able to really levy taxes under the articles of federation (along with other issues that are related, such as disputes between the states, some post war debt, etc.). I would think we would want people to follow a set of laws, such that those without a good set of ethics would not be given free realm. These could be decided collectively among the mass of people, but such a system for so many people (I'm using the U.S. as a basis of example due to that being my home nation, of which I am most familiar with government if I haven't been clear about that so far.) Would be clunky and inefficient, so we have lawmakers who make decisions for us, who I would hope we would want them to be as dedicated to the position as possible, so that they would be best focused on laws. Eliminating outside forces and other forms of misconduct that wouldn't represent the people as much as they would like, and they would need to eat and afford to survive, so a form of payment for them would almost have to be crucial in my understanding. This would have to be done with taxes as money created out of thin air in such a fashion would likely have lessened value, as seen in post world war one Germany, with the severe devaluation of the Mark. I am wondering how would this actually be done circumvented in a libertarian society to best support the people without screwing over others from birth? In no way are governments perfect, and I am not saying they are. And I realize I am fixating on the issue of taxation, while there are other aspects such as choice and so on (But if we chose whether or not we would pay taxes, who would be the first to jump in that boat.) But in all seriousness, how could this work if it's not just digging a hole to fill another one? If anyone has anything they would like me to clarify or expand upon, ask me. I hope not to have come off as trollish, I am leigitmatley just curious what people's beliefs are about the more specifics, as mostly what I see is about giving people their own choices and being against taxation, and not much about how these would be implemented or their perceived effects on the world.

"How could we further lower taxes, realistically?",Libertarian,"The left tries to punish the rich for being rich by taxing the people who don't have the money to pay the salary of someone who can get them out of paying taxes. That is, you suddenly get nailed by a 32% tax rate once you hit 157k (depending on your deduction). But if someone has an income of several million, they can just pay someone to find every tax loophole to get a lower tax rate than the person earning 157k, probably as a salary, maybe as a project manager, director or VP - which tend to be insecure positions anyways. You don't really get a foothold in approaching serious wealth until you get into the 500k+ range a year. The left loves to shoot themselves in the foot in achieving their own aims of reducing inequality. Basically the system right now is more favored to produce the giant spike of wealth we have now - simply because the tax brackets are too low. If you're going to tax people more money, do it after they literally earn more money from actually investing it and growing their wealth. The left loves to say that the middle class is shrinking. They're half right about the problem - but it's nice that it's shrinking from both sides, not just getting poorer.

The critical difference between the radical left and the libertarian left that has divided this sub...,Libertarian,"... is the seizure of property and involuntary redistribution. I think that those who claim to be left libertarian but also are proponents of 'seizing the means' are being disingenuous, basically concern trolling. And I would really appreciate it if you stopped corrupting the left libertarian systems that *respect* private property, such as my own well developed and reasoned communal economic system. It *is* rational, it *does* work, and it doesn't tread on any snakes. You cannot call yourself libertarian if you cannot respect private property. If you're not willing to find an alternative to 'seizing the means', then indeed you probably shouldn't be here confusing newcomers about what libertarianism really stands for. Because what results is what you've seen today here - true left libertarians left out in the cold because they were mistaken for left radicals, simply because a lot of the words were the same. A long-standing and respected community divided down a line that should have never been drawn. Those of us on the left are understandably concerned about not having any representation in the mod team, but I truly believe that if we educate them about left libertarian forms that meet the criteria of libertarian, the *same criteria they use* for their own systems, we can come back together as **just libertarians**.

Reagan is the next closest among modern presidents. Lots of deregulation, tax cuts, open immigration, foreign policy realism, nice comments about libertarians. But he loses thanks to his massive increases in defense spending (and therefore deficits) and his military adventurism in Central America. You have to go back to Calvin Coolidge, the only president to reduce government spending in real terms year over year, to find someone vaguely libertarian. Before that maybe Lincoln, more likely Jefferson. But let’s look at Trump’s libertarian accomplishments (I’m aware of the failings as well): 1. Tax cuts 2. Largest reductions in the federal register (most deregulation) 3. First step act, biggest federal criminal justice reform in a generation 4. Appointment of Neil Gorsuch, the only SCOTUS judge who understands natural law 5. Pulled us out of both Syria and now Afghanistan Does anyone else come close?

I'm just here to ask a question. Is that okay?,Libertarian,"I don't tend to define myself politically for a few reasons, but I definitely find myself agreeing with a lot of libertarian ideas. One area I struggle with personally is the idea of free speach. Here in Australia we don't have the same constitutional right to free speach as America. We have a freedom of expression as long as we don't impose on someone else's wellbeing (as I understand it). Pretty close but for a few minor details if you ask me. One of the main differences I can see with this is that we don't have large formal hate groups like the KKK because they infringe on the security of others (through discrimination), so it is illegal to spread their ideas. That's not to say that Australia is free of racism or even racist groups. But, for instance, if someone were to come here to preach the word of a group like the KKK they would be deported. It also seems to have kept our media a lot closer to the truth by not letting people go down the 'Alex Jones' path of just making stuff up. (We have some pretty strict legislation about the responsibilty of press I believe). So my question is, if you get to say what you like, when you like, is it really that much better than getting to say what you like when you like as long as you aren't hurting anyone?

I’m questioning my political beliefs.,Libertarian,"So I’ve always considered myself a left leaning libertarian if that makes sense. I’ve seen what the Republicans have done to my state and area and so I do vote Democrat in state elections( since there are never any other parties running beside dems and reps). I believe the governments job should be the security of both citizens, borders and bodies of water surrounding said country. As well as ensuring the health and wellbeing of its citizens. I supported the ACA because I used at the time because I couldn’t afford other companies payments. I got coverage for basically stitches and broken bones but then it just became more expensive towards the end of Obama’s presidency and into trumps. Now I’m no socialist or anything but I do believe that when states don’t help their citizens then the fed should step in. I don’t like trump and his policies because I never considered myself a nationalist or anything like that and I believe he is authoritarian. In these times of trump I have fallen into the identity politics and have voted for many dems. I don’t want government regulating everything cause that can and has hindered states and companies from being able to conduct business and such. But I don’t think that federal agencies like the EPA should be moved back or that federal and public lands have been scaled back to make way for oil and gas companies. I’m a farmer and I want the EPA so they can help me protect the environment from pollution and other environmental dangers. I support the Paris climate accord because as a farmer I depend on the environment staying the way it is and I can tell that the weather is getting worse.

What is the Libertarian free market view on pharmaceutical price hikes?,Libertarian,"EDIT: some good discussions on this post as intended. Also lots of trolls from other subs that, rather than contributing a different point of view to the discussion, prefer instead to resort to name calling and broad generalizations. Oh well. Currently reading capitalism and freedom by Milton Friedman, and I have only just started so maybe the book addresses this. And I want to preface my reasoning with this: I am a believer in a free market, competitive capitalism, but I can’t help but wonder about pharma price hikes. In a free market with “no” regulation, what is to stop patent-protected items from enormous, 1000% price hikes by the companies that own the rights? Now, I understand these price hikes primarily affect insurance companies, but isn’t this one issue with a free market? If a company owns the rights by law to a product, who is to stop them from hiking up the price by a ridiculous amount? And this only pertains, in my opinion, to items that are absolutely essential to life. With all other items, a company, even if they own exclusive rights to a product, can hike up the price but it won’t matter because people will simply not buy the product as it is not essential. But with certain medicines that are essential for life MUST be bought; the “consumers” have no choice in the matter.

You Can't Argue against Socialism's 100 Percent Record of Failure,Libertarian," Socialism is extremely in vogue. Opinion pieces which tell us to stop obsessing over socialism’s past failures, and start to get excited about its future potential, have almost become a genre in its own right. But... First, as much as the authors insist that previous examples of socialism were not “really” socialist, none of them can tell us what exactly they would do differently. Rather than providing at least a rough outline of how “their” version of socialism would work in practice, the authors escape into abstraction, and talk about lofty aspirations rather than tangible institutional characteristics. And... Ultimately, the contemporary argument for socialism boils down to: “next time will be different because we say so.” After more than two dozen failed attempts, that is just not good enough. Socialism is an absolutely unworkable failure no matter how you dress it up and always will be. ",a8xm5h,self.Libertarian,,True

A Few Questions to Libertarians Out of Curiosity,Libertarian,"I am not socialist, I go through many subreddits. Just some questions popped up in my mind: 1- What do you think about all the inventions done by government-funded institutes including many military innovations, innovations who passed to consumer commodities. Medicine, technology and so on. Many private tech industries have their technology based on technology governments created. 2- For 'Taxation is theft' thing. How many of you are aware of the concept called 'Social Contract'? Just asking. 3- What enforces laws to prevent oligopolies, monopolies or unethical free market practices? If corporations have enough money to organize their own military, will they be exempt from law enforcement?. 4- Do libertarians support worker unions? Do you think workers have the right to bargain their labor through unions and insure their labor? Or is it too socialist for libertarians? 5- If an industry has a high risk and high levels of entry. How can ordinary citizens gather capital to create a competitor? Can larger corporations go full mafia on smaller startups? What keeps them from doing it? 6- Do libertarians support the idea of stocks of companies being shared amongst the people who work in it instead of concentrated on one person? After all, the company wouldn't work if all gears do not mesh. And would prevent one person claiming most of everyone's labor and work as libertarians defend it. 7- I think I've seen many results to this but is there a consensus amongst libertarians to solve climate change problem? 8- Can free market prevent overhunting of endangered animals and potential extinction? 9- Do libertarians know Cuba has sanctions against it? Don't you think it is still impressive to operate decently under that conditions? Their social services are functioning decently afaik. 10- What libertarians think of the benefits of easily affordable (mostly public funded) education to increase the qualified workforce to boost the economy? 11- What prevents corporations to set their own laws within their land, would this lead to feudalism and slavery? 12- Will technological innovation decrease work hours in a libertarian society? Because as far as I go into this subreddit I get the feeling of a 'Your meaning in life is to work.' philosophy which is kinda spooky(dystopian kind) for me. 13- Wouldn't all citizens fight against law enforcement if they all have guns? I get the power monopoly thing but then the laws become useless as law enforcement can just be mowed down with recreational disassembled A-10 autocannon from backyard. &#x200B; Edit: extra question: 14- Would libertarianism cause more unemployment to break the power of unions. Or lower the unemployment drastically because of necessity which can make the jobs of startups to find workforce harder. 15- How would free market handle workplace safety",a9qp3r,self.Libertarian,,True

Thus, if you want to draw an arbitrary line of where the limit of power for weapon should be, you are no difference to a gun-grabber, your lines are right next to each other. Additionally, there's no way for you to know what kind of weapon with what power and area of effect will be needed in the future. Failure of your imagination should not restrict other rights to self-defense. Meanwhile the benefits are immense. The more powerful weapon is also proportionately a greater deterrence to potential tyrants.

"Once lab grown meat becomes comparable in price and availability to real meat, would you support a ban on the sale/commercial productio of real meat?",Libertarian,"For me, right now the sale of real meat is pretty clearly not a violation of the NAP. But once lab grown meat is as cheap and available as real meat, the production of real meat is entirely uneccessary, and I would consider any suffering that is entitely uneccessary to be in violation of the NAP. I wouldn't want a ban on the consumption of meat, as there are still times when the consumption of real meat might be neccessary, such as anyone that might rely on hunting or privately raised livestock as a food source. However, with lab grown meat a viable alternative to real meat the the purchase of real mear will be wholly unnecessary. A ban on the sale of real meat would also have a lot of positive consequences considering the massive energy inefficiency of raising livestock and the environmental damages associated with doing so. So, thoughts? Right now, I obviously think meat should be legal - the suffering involved in its production has a benefit. But once lab grown meat is a viable alternative, I don't see any way that the sale or production of real meat could be considered moral, as there will be no benefit or reason for the suffering caused.

Regardless of the 'brand of communism' I will claim to be a part of in the future, I advocate for decentralized planning, direct democracy(or improved representative democracy if not possible) and worker control of the means of production. I disapprove with the idea of a 'vanguard party' as it is in Leninism, even though my views on it may change if I could see that succesfully staging a revolution can only be possible with it, which I don't think to be case now. I also don't think that the state should be abolished right after the revolution, and it should wait until the capitalist forces of the world are defeated and the capitalist way of thinking that everyone is used to is gone. My views on this can also change as I really like the idea of abolishing the state right after the revolution, it is just that I don't find it as a succesfull way to defeat capitalism. &#x200B; So, you can ask me anything. I am still uninformed about a lot of specifics, but I think that I can clear many misconceptions some of you may have about communism.",a330si,self.Libertarian,,True

I wish the rest of the constitution (especially the bill of rights) got the same public (and political) support as the 2nd amendment,Libertarian,"Since TJ Kirk/The Amazing Atheist gave me the idea to write this post I will link his video here:  Think about how well defended the 2nd amendment is. You have the NRA, gun manufacturers, federal GOP politicians, right wing activists and more all protecting the 2nd amendment. On top of all that it's very clearly politically dumb, for any federal politician to be flippant about the 2nd amendment. That all being said let's look at how the rest of the bill of right is treated: The 1st amendment: I'd say this one is treated better than most of the rest of the bill of rights. I think most of (if not all) the major ways this was attacked were either by Trump or in relation to the internet or the freedom from/of religion. Don't get me wrong in relation to those previously mentioned 3 things this one desperately needs to be defended far better. 3rd: I think this should be demoted to outside the BOR and replaced with something more important. Am I wrong? Are US soldiers really wanting to stay in strangers' houses? edit: I might be wrong here the more I think about it but this one is still fine. Although needing this one is hard to imagine. I think the only circumstance where we would need is one where the gov doesn't care to even pretend to obey the constitution anymore. 4th: This might just be dead. The 'patriot' act kicked the shit out of this one. BTW don't you hate when politicians name things like that? Give them names that imply the opposite of what the thing actually does. So that anyone against it looks bad. To get back on topic; The NSA is the the ultimate fuck you to the 4th. Also the CIA does a lot of the same bullshit the NSA does. Lastly There is the TSA security theater. 5th: This might be fine but arguably somethings that go against the 6th go against this one. Also there are problems with this one that relate to the gov taking land. 6th: Most people don't get speedy fair trials (especially in immigration court). There are so many problems with trials in the US (all over really but the US is the topic). Including biases, the wealthy/powerful getting more and better lawyers and problems with public defenders. Also there is m**ilitary** tribunals and Guantanamo bay. For the BS icing in the trash cake; The cops are allowed to 'confiscate' just about anything as 'evidence' (steal). 7th: This is fine. It's not really in trouble. I can understand some arguments that this doesn't wok because of inflation and lack of man power. There are lots of problems caused by too many trials, too few people available and too little time. 8th: Bail is all fucked up. This country has massive problems on the topic of fines. We execute people (the way it's done is cruel and unusual). Our prison system is so fucked that being sent to prison is cruel and unusual. And last but certainly not least; there is Guantanamo bay (possibly the mother of all fucked up prisons) 9th: name any example of the gov or police punishing someone for something that isn't a crime, because that would break this one. 10th: Almost anyone (even if you really left wing) can name case when this one was absolutely violated. To sum it up People need to defend most of (if not all) this these far better. We need to defend these the way NRA members defend the 2nd amendment. What has happen to some amendments is equivalent to a full gun ban. Even if you disagree with the **(and political)** part, violations of the BOR should get the same backlash as violations of 2a. Among the voters there are hardly any strong defenders of the 1st, 4th 6th 8th 9th or 10th. Although those have the problem of most politicians attacking them and hardly any defending them. I just wish there was a National free speech association, a N.Privacy.A., N.freedom of/from religion A. and so on... and that they all had as much money and power as the NRA. edit: Look even if you think the 2nd is heavily attacked 8/10 don't receive attention.

I am stepping down from the r/Libertarian mod team.,Libertarian,"Dear r/Libertarian, It is with a heavy heart and a disproportionate amount of sentimentality that I have decided to step down as a volunteer moderator of this community. The majority of the responsibility for the chaos that has plagued our community for the last several days rests squarely upon my shoulders. Our head moderator u/SamsLembas and I both spoke with u/internetmallcop independently of one another when he reached out to us about testing the Community Points system, and we both agreed to allow them to test it at r/Libertarian. However, I spoke at much greater length with u/internetmallcop, agreed to be his point of contact for testing the features here, and frankly had no expectation of presence or assistance from u/SamsLembas as he has been almost completely inactive as a moderator since I joined the team about a year and a half ago. While I would have been completely overwhelmed regardless as the only active moderator present in the sub, a confluence of issues in my personal life severely truncated the amount of time I had available to respond to and manage the issues that resulted once these new features were switched on. I found the feature set to be promising enough to test out for our community because it claimed to offer a federated means of decision making that would ultimately reduce emphasis on decision making by the mod team and distribute decision making power among our longest-term and highest-contributing users, while supposedly offering strong protections against outside capture and meddling by antagonistic brigaders. In hindsight, I exhibited an inexcusable lack of skepticism and extremely poor judgement in agreeing so readily to having these features tested in our sub. As a mod of the sub, few people should have been more responsible for being able to predict the results we all observed. This poor decision making put the established order, and perhaps even the existence, of our community at risk; and it is with this admission that I recuse myself from the moderators' bench. I want to clear up, once and for all, that these features were in no way 'forced' upon our community. Again, both u/SamsLembas and I green-lit the experiment after being approached by u/internetmallcop. As far as I know, the mass-spamming and brigading effort launched by r/ChapoTrapHouse and other antagonistic subs which began only days prior to the implementation of the feature test was purely a miserable coincidence. u/internetmallcop has been hit with an undeserved flood of accusatory and damning messages as a result of the misinformation that has been spread about the nature and sequence of events around the feature test. He failed to gain assent from u/rightc0ast for implementing the test features, believing that agreement from u/SamsLembas and I should be sufficient, and this led u/rightc0ast to assume that the features were foisted upon our sub unilaterally by the admin team. But in all fairness, u/SamsLembas and I also both failed to notify u/rightc0ast, and u/rightc0ast also failed to notice/respond to a final modmail message to our entire mod team fully two days before the feature test began, or to question u/internetmallcop having been added to our moderator team fully two weeks before the feature test began (changes to our mod team being a once-in-many-years occurrence over the history of our sub). **As a parting gift**: I have reversed all 'emergency' user bans that were issued during the crisis of the last few days, save for a small handful of accounts that were engaged in clear and genuine violations of site-wide rules against spamming, threatening, harassing, and inciting violence. Hopefully this addresses everyone's reasonable concerns about turning the corner into the censorship of political speech—which I genuinely believe and hope that u/rightc0ast had no intention of doing. **As a parting plea**: I would ask that both u/SamsLembas and u/rightc0ast either wake up and accept responsibility for moderating this subreddit if they are going to continue sitting on the two senior mod perches, or get out of the way and let someone who wants to do it, do it. I would also ask that all of our users put pressure on them to do so. I am fully on-board with—and a true believer in—the hands-off and pro-free-speech moderation policy that this sub has woven into its very fabric. But both of our senior moderators have turned this concept into an excuse for being 99% absent and inactive in the sub, refusing to help attend to even the bare minimum requirements of moderation duties, such as removing prohibited material, spam, and infractions of site-wide rules. In the roughly one and a half years since I joined the mod team, I have been the only one to do *anything* to manage the sub—and our public mod logs will spell this out. While as one single person I haven't been able to commit enough time to deal with this burden completely or consistently, I have at least made an effort. I've received no thanks for this from u/SamsLembas, whose only mod activity here over the past *year*, prior to approving the test of Community Points, was to temporarily de-mod me in anger a few months ago because he felt strongly that I should not publicly call out brigading efforts from other subs. He never bothered to respond meaningfully to my attempt to deliberate the disagreement, and has not spoken to me since. While u/rightc0ast has at least in distant memory communicated appreciation of the time I've put in to remove spam, he too has been almost entirely absent and non-contributing during my time here. If the lack of bare-minimum moderation continues in my absence, I believe that it will eventually put our subreddit at risk of garnering true unilateral intervention from the admin team. It was only about one month ago that we were contacted by u/redtaboo warning of the ultimate consequence of intervention by the admin team if our moderation team continued to fail in its basic duties to promptly remove spam, pornography, and sitewide rule violations, and demanding a response with a plan of action to get more moderators on board here. In addition to relaying my above complaints, I made it known at this time that I was willing to step up and take responsibility for that plan, but that I would not continue to do all the work while sitting under two inactive and unresponsive senior moderators who refused to lift a finger, one of whom who had given me reason to fear being de-modded again in the future to avoid having to negotiate any disagreement with me. This was all in full view of u/SamsLembas, who refused to respond then and since (even in the presence of direct communication from an admin) who has still taken zero action to find and vet additional moderators, and who continues to sit in the head mod seat only to obstinately reject any responsibility for the well-being of the sub. r/Libertarian deserves a robust and politically impartial moderation team that, in a combined effort with each other, can actually be present to answer the questions and concerns of users, can act reasonably promptly to deal with spam, pornography, and sitewide rule violations (if only in the interest of preserving the existence of the sub), and can put in a basic level of effort periodically to do things like keeping the sidebar up to date, performing some basic visual enhancements, and maybe even doing the legwork to put together an AMA with a libertarian figure a few times a year. With enough hands, a modicum of moderation would be light work for all involved, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who not only fit the bill but would be *happy* to volunteer 15 minutes of their time a few days a week. If you are that person, or know that person, make it known to u/SamsLembas. Hopefully he'll come to his senses and be willing to step up *at least* to the extent of bringing on a handful of other people onboard to do the work for him.",a2ujrx,self.Libertarian,,True

Can a Libertarian state survive without public education?,Libertarian,"I think a government is necessary, with its main purpose being - to protect the rights and liberty of its own people. One aspect of this is having a professional military that will be used to protect the country from outside threats. However, thinking about other aspects, I don’t see how a Libertarian state can survive without public education. Every child is born without prior knowledge. For example, no child is born with an innate desire to protect the freedom of speech of those he disagrees with - this has to be taught. Continuing with the example - if there is no requirement to teach freedom of speech, it is inevitable that within a certain time, a decentralized groups of different people who don’t value freedom of speech will form. Similarly, you can change “freedom of speech” to any value, such as freedom of religion or private property or something more specific such as gun ownership rights. The bottom line is that the foundations on which a Libertarian state is formed upon naturally erode without the proper protection. This leads to a natural fallout where the state naturally becomes less libertarian, or a civil war where the forces meant to protect freedom clash with the growing forces of those who don’t value it. The only viable solution is to have mandatory education of democratic values, human rights, liberty and political theory. This means that in order to preserve itself, much like having a standing military, a government must - introduce mandatory education up to a certain age - create public facilities, or fund, those who cannot afford this education Do you agree?

Real socialism is impossible and that is the reason that it has never been tried yet. When socialist regurgitate the argument “real socialism hasn’t been tried yet” they are really saying “real socialism is so incompatible with human nature that nobody has been able to successfully implement it in a way that is good”. Human society is made up billions of individual minds that are competing to produce surviving offspring so that they can pass their genetic legacy on. This is the principal mechanism for evolution. Socialism requires cooperation among individuals that are programed to compete. If humans were a hive mind like that of an ant society, socialism would be possible and the preferable system for producing a prosperous society.

Personally, I agree mostly with Marx's critique of capitalism and its ills. NOT THE SOLUTION. Hayek is where things fall down for me, I don't get the thought process behind libertarian economics. If the government was such a bad influence, why then has the market been in constant boom/bust cycles due to a lack of regulation of the banks. That brings me onto taxes. Personally, I have to say the whole idea of cutting taxes leading to an increase in revenue is frankly bullshit. Not only does it lead to massive deficits, just look at it under Trump, it also more often than not is directed at the top 1% of earners. Don't get me wrong though, I agree with cutting taxes on middle and lower income people but I don't think the rich need to get richer. All in all, I'm just wondering what your opinions would be.

If history has taught us anything it’s that walls don’t keep people out. The great wall couldn’t stop the Huns and Rome and Constantinople couldn’t prevent invaders. I don’t see why the citizen and their taxes has to pay for something that a small minority of people in the US want. This whole deal about how Mexico is paying for the wall. If that’s the case why is he going to congress and asking for money, our money that I believe can be used way better in other ways. I mean his troop deployment to the border has already cost tax payers over 200 million. Wtf I’ve been trying to get my parish to fix our roads with tax payer money and they have always said that they can’t afford to.

Update on Community Points in r/Libertarian,Libertarian,"We've been listening to your concerns about this experiment. Many of them are valid concerns. In response, I want to clarify a few things about why we're doing this and how these features were enabled in r/Libertarian. The first point I want to clarify is why we're doing this at all. We are a small experimental team within Reddit (think April fools type experiments) working on ways to give moderators and users more control over their communities. To do that, we are trying to build tools that allow communities to run with less intervention by Reddit. We’re not always sure what those tools should be, and we’re using experiments like this to help figure it out. There are hundreds of ideas about how communities (whether online or in the real world) can be governed, and we want to experiment with a few different ideas until we find one that works well for online communities and how Reddit communities currently operate. For this first experiment, Community Points, we wanted to give users and mods a better way to signal in their subreddit, and to give users a chance to voice their opinions on community decisions. We picked r/Libertarian because we believed you would be interested in trying new ways of self governance. We also had some ideas around alternative forms of making decisions that we thought this community would understand and play around with. Futarchy, for example, is an interesting idea that hasn’t been given a chance to be applied at scale. The second point we want to clarify is that we did in fact work with the mods on this experiment. Alpha-testing new features is voluntary so we want mods to opt in to testing these experimental features and do not want to force it on subreddits that don’t want them. Here is a timeline of events that transpired. We made the timeline anonymous, but the individuals involved can step forward if they would like. * 11/14 5PM UTC: The first mod we contacted responded with: * “I'm extremely interested. I don't know if you've monitored our moderation policies here, but I've tried to let things be as community-driven as possible. Let me know how I can help out.” * 11/15 6PM UTC: One of the other mods responded: * “Ok. I'll put it on my calendar for Nov 29th, and keep my eyes peeled starting then... I am happy to be your POC if needed.” * 11/16 8:30PM UTC: One of the mods added me - u/internetmallcop \- as a moderator. * 11/27 5:30AM UTC: I sent a modmail before enabling with info on how it works and to answer questions. * 11/29: We enabled points. That being said, a poll to disable the feature has reached the decision threshold. True to our word, we will honor the decision and remove the feature on Monday. I will remove myself as a moderator after the feature is disabled. While it is unfortunate that the experiment was short lived in r/Libertarian, we are grateful for what we were able to learn in the few days it was active. u/internetmallcop **Edit 12/3/18:** The feature is turned off and all polls are closed.",a27zee,self.Libertarian,,True

"Former State Representative Brandon Phinney, Ask Me Anything.",Libertarian,"Let's do this thing. Greetings, I am Brandon Phinney, former State Representative from New Hampshire. I got elected in 2016 as a Republican, mostly out of necessity, because the Libertarian Party did not have ballot access and being an Independent is not an option here. I believe in minimal government, which means controlled spending, tax repeals and tax cuts. I brought my ideas of personal freedom and responsible economics to the State House from my district, while also promoting criminal justice reform, marijuana legalization and repealing erroneous and unenforceable regulations. Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership does not work with libertarians or Libertarians in the State House. There was only a small faction of the party that believed in basic libertarian principles and their contributions to policy were ignored. A very contentious budget year in 2017 showed me the true face of the New Hampshire Republican Party and I did not want to continue in such a hostile environment. I officially switched parties in June of last year to take a stand against the Republican spending increases and personal freedom limitations. Since Caleb Dyer and I did not get re-elected, there are no big L voices left. I plan to still be active in New Hampshire politics by running for my local city council next year. I have plenty of time to work with my community and state to make a difference. With that being said, let's have a conversation! &#x200B; EDIT: PLEASE do NOT censor anyone, ban anyone from posting here or delete any comments. If I see it, I will end my time here.

Your view on abortion?,Libertarian,"Hello there. I wanted to ask you about your personal opinions on abortion. I consider myself to be a libertarian, I believe that freedom is the most basic of rights, that governments shouldn’t be trusted and, naturally, citizens’ well-being (and particularly education) need not be in the governing body’s best interests. I have a wide array of views that I believe are universally seen as libertarian, but I struggle with several matters. One of them is abortion. I understand that the basic issue is the definition of humanity - when can the fetus be called human? Instantly, after a week, month, two months? Many people differ, and that’s not the issue that I want to discuss. My personal belief is that the matter of abortion represents a conflict between the two basic rights that seem equally important - the right to exist (fetus) versus the right of self-ownership (mother). Nobody should force a woman to carry a fetus against her will and nobody should decide about the fetus’ existence. In my discussions with other people I have defended both of them, yet such a stance offers no way out, no solution to the matter at hand. Sure, if the technology was advanced enough to remove a fetus and place it in volunteering anti-abortionists’ care, I guess everybody would be satisfied. But there exist no such solutions. I do not wish to discuss here what makes a human being - there have been many attempts at answering that question, and as far as I know, there’s no perfect definition. When it comes to regulations, I believe the government should stay out of the issue (like with every other thing), but I wanted to ask you - what do YOU personally think of it? Do you support abortion? Do you reject it? Why? What principles make you believe what you believe? I’m sure that for some people the answer varies depending on the circumstances (conception via rape, disabled child, financial situation of the pregnant woman, etc), but the underlying conflict stays the same.

"Should the Libertarian Party adopt an official position on climate change, and what should that position be?",Libertarian,"Hi all, I'm new to reddit and relatively new to the Libertarian Party. I've never really been politically active. I usually only voted Democrat because they seemed to be the sole party to believe in climate change, but that seems to be changing. I'm basically a one issue voter on the subject as I studied climate science in undergrad, conservation biology in postgrad, and am currently researching the effects climate change will have on the US. Besides the climate change issue, I see myself as much more of a Libertarian. I think that climate change policies can exist in a Libertarian world, but Libertarian climate polices are hard to come by on the national level. Climate change is not even mentioned on the Libertarian party website and we all know what Gary Johnson said regarding climate change and the sun eventually overtaking Earth 5 billion years from now. I'd be very interested in hearing how you guys think the Libertarian Party should approach the issue or if you even think it's an issue worth addressing. Side note, I am willing to debate and try to win over any climate change skeptics/deniers who are willing to listen with an open mind. Same goes if you have any hot takes about conservation biology. I'm a big fan of pleistocene rewilding and other more aggressive forms of conservativation biology. I will happily educate anyone interested lol",a58e1c,self.Libertarian,,True

Why is the flagrant subversion of democracy in Wisconsin not a bigger deal in this sub?,Libertarian,"Republicans in Wisconsin (and Michigan) are performing insane power grabs that are destroying checks and balances and usurping judicial power into the legislative branch.

WEDC's board, rather than the governor, would appoint WEDC's leader. - **Put lawmakers in charge of litigation, allowing them to keep alive a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare.** - **Give lawmakers — instead of the attorney general — control over how court settlements are spent.** - **Make it easier for lawmakers to hire private attorneys at taxpayer expense when they are accused of violating the open records law or other statutes.** - **Eliminate the solicitor general's office, which oversees high-profile litigation.** - Modestly lower the state’s income tax rates next year to offset about $60 million in online sales taxes from out-of-state retailers that Wisconsin recently began collecting. - **Require Evers to get permission from lawmakers to ban guns in the state Capitol.** - **Bar judges from giving deference to state agencies’ interpretations of laws when they are challenged in court. That could make it easier to win lawsuits challenging how environmental regulations and other laws are being enforced.** - Broaden lawmakers' powers to block rules written by the Evers administration to implement state laws. - Require the Evers administration to report if the governor pardons anyone or his aides release anyone from prison early. - Force Evers to get permission from the Legislature before asking the federal government to make any changes to programs that are run jointly by the state and federal governments. That would limit the governor's flexibility in how he runs public benefits programs. - If the Legislature’s budget committee determined the administration was not implementing recent changes to those programs, it could reduce funding and staffing for state agencies. - Require Evers to go along with a plan aimed at reducing premiums for insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces for individuals. - Channel federal money into a smaller number of state road projects, so that other projects could avoid having to comply with federal environmental and wage laws Is this just fine?",a3d8mv,self.Libertarian,,True

This subs projection of 'socialists' is laughable.,Libertarian,"Full disclaimer, I lean pretty left on economic issues. If I dint know better, I would think this is /r/AntiSocialist instead of libertarian, I swear half the time I see a post on /r/all its just some anti-socialist meme or shitpost Also Also just to clear up some clarifications, Yes Bernie has 3 houses, no I dont care. Yes I want free healthcare and college, No I dont think we should take literally everything away from the 1% Im a 'Democratic Socialist' As in I believe that our taxes should go to something better such as college or heathcare. Taxes are inevitable and the money is there, (Bernies free college was 70B a year, yet trump increased committed to a 750B 'Defense budget') Most 'Democratic Socialists' just want our tax dollars spent better, very few, aside from the crazies on twitter actually want socialism, we have just been labeled as socialist by all sides because the 1% doesn't want the system to change. You might also argue that bernie tried to tax the 1%, and sure he did but his tax was on HFT trades which arguably bring no value to the economy*(Disclaimer not an economist) Anyway this is just a rant, Im not looking for you to change my opinions Im just pointing out that your projections are very skewed and wrong Edit: I put 'Socialists' in quotes because were not actually socialists Edit2: Im not strictly saying libertarian view are wrong either, no political system is perfect.",a7g4h5,self.Libertarian,,True
