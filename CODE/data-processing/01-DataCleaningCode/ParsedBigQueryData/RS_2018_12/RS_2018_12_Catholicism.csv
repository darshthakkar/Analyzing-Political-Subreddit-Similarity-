"The intentions of my hearts, may they be purified!",Catholicism,"God looks at us, and doesn’t see our sins, but looks at our ability to love him, and carry out his will. Therefore I’ve asked God to give me the same vision he has, for people. I write here, because I genuinely want to know how are some people doing and therefore I contact them. To those people I have ever been attracted to, I start to create hidden intentions in my heart in hopes that we end up hanging out and start going out. I create these intentions because I often think, man what if they do love the Lord with all their mind heart and soul and who cares about their past. It’s a lot like going to mass. At first, I only want to go to mass, because Christ will be there, but when I see a beautiful woman I get distracted and my intentions for mass have been tainted. I write this because I struggle in only wanting the Lord our God, and being pure in my intentions. Pray for me. ",a92h9o,self.Catholicism,,True

Novena to St. Expeditus for STUBBORN Cases (Truly Helps Miracles),Catholicism,"**Nine Day Novena:** Use in Stubborn Cases Passing this on because St. Expeditus expedited my desperate prayers to God!!!!! If it is possible, recite this Novena before the Most Blessed Sacrament. Saint Expeditus suffered a lot during the time of Diocletion. He is holding a cross in which is inscribed 'Hodie' (Today) while he is stepping on a crow which is crying 'Cras' (Tomorrow) in order to remind us not to doubt even for a single moment the great mercy of God, and not to postpone for tomorrow the devout and trusting prayer but to call on him always as our advocate by the side of our Blessed Virgin. &#x200B; ***Act of Contrition:*** My LORD Jesus Christ, Father of endless charity, I am heartily sorry for my sins. Grant me, therefore, pardon of my sins and the grace I ask of You thru the merits of the sorrows of Your loving Mother and the virtues of Your martyr, Saint Expeditus. Prayer to Saint Expeditus for Each Day ***Concluding Prayer:*** Oh Saint Expeditus, my protector, in you I place my hope that my petitions may be granted if they are for my own good. Please ask Our Lord, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin, for the forgiveness of my sins, and the grace to change my life, particularly the grace ... (mention here the particular grace desired) and I promise to follow your examples and will propagate this devotion to you. ***FIRST DAY*** O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, through the lively faith which was granted you by God, I ask you to awaken the same faith in my heart, that I may also believe wholeheartedly that there is God, but most particularly that I may be saved from sinning against Him. Three Our Fathers in honour of the Most Holy Trinity then the concluding prayer. Concluding Prayer for Each Day Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that any one who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, and sought thine intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To thee I come; before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my words but graciously hear and grant my prayer. Amen. One Hail Mary in honour of Our Lady of Sorrows. **SECOND DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expedius, through the eviable hope given you by God, pray that those of little belief may be penetrated by some rays of hope so that they also receive eternal things; please pray that ardent hope in God be also given me and hold me steadfast in the midst of sufferings. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **THIRD DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, through the endless love which Our Lord planted in your heart, please remove from mine all the shackles tied by worldliness, that without them I may love only God in all eternity. Amen. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **FOURTH DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, who knew fully well the teaching of the Divine Teacher to carry the cross and follow Him, ask Him for the graces I need that I may fight my own passions. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **FIFTH DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, through the bountiful graces you received from Heaven that you may conserve all your virtues, grant also that I may get rid of all the feelings that block my way to Heaven. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **SIXTH DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, through the sufferings and humiliations which you received for the love of God, grant me also this grace which is very pleasing to God, and free me from anger and hardness of heart which is the stumbling block of my soul. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **SEVENTH DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, you know that prayer is the golden key that will open the Kingdom of Heaven, teach me to pray in a manner which is desirable to Our Lord and to His Heart, that I may live only for Him, that I may die only for Him, and that I may pray only to Him in all eternity. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **EIGHTH DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, through the clean desire that reigned in all your feelings, word and actions, please let them guide me also in my endless search for the glory of God and the good of my fellowmen. Three Our Fathers then the concluding prayer. **NINTH DAY** My Lord Jesus Christ ... O Glorious Martyr, Saint Expeditus, who was so much loved by the Queen of Heaven, that to you nothing was denied, ask her, please my advocate, that through the sufferings of her Divine Son and her own sorrows, I may receive this day the grace I ask of you; but above all the grace to die first before I commit any mortal sin.

Reading for the Vigil,Catholicism,"The people who were wandering in darkness cried out to heaven, 'Great God, come quickly to our aid! Loving Lord, hasten to help us!' Hearing their prayers, God took counsel with Himself. In a three-fold voice He said, 'It is time,' and the heavens hushed in wonder. So the Son stripped Himself of His robes of glory. He removed His regal crown His power and wealth were set aside. And while all things were in quiet silence, and night was in the midst of her swift course, the Almighty Word, leapt down out of His royal throne. He came to us in such a poor, pitiful state, devoid of crown, throne, robes and power; and coming He asked us what we had to give Him. 'My children, I have no clothes, for I have set them aside for love of you. What have you to give me, to cover my nakedness?' 'We have only the womb of a Virgin. Of her you may take our flesh though it is diseased with death and stained with sin.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made the flesh clean and living. 'My children, I have no house, for I have left My Father for love of you. What home have you to give me, to shelter me from the wind?' 'We have only the stable of this Inn, where the sheep and oxen sleep.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made that stable the palace of the wide world and high heavens. 'My children, I have no throne, for I have set aside My seat for love of you. What throne have you to give me, from which I may administer justice and peace?' 'We have only this manger, the feeding place of ox and donkey.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made that manger more holy than the Ark of the Covenant. 'My children, I have no way to travel, for I who was once all places have bound myself to this one place for love of you. What steed have you to give me, that I might ride to your rescue?' 'We have only this donkey, who is used to bear the burdens of his owner.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made that donkey the bearer of the most noble Son of God. 'My children, I have no food, for I who once had no need have made myself needful for love of you. What meal have you to give me, that I might be nourished for the great battle?' 'We have only this bread and this wine, which will be used for Passover.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made it His broken Body and His blessed Blood. 'My children, I have no crown, for I have laid aside my diadem for love of you. What crown have you to give me, to show that I am your King?' 'We have only this crown of thorns, which will pierce your brow.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made it more noble than any golden laurel that ever adorned a Caesar. 'My children, I have no sword, for I have laid aside all my power for love of you. What weapon have you to give me, that I might free you from your oppressors?' 'We have only this cross, on which to hang you.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He defeated both death and sin. 'My children, I have no bed, for I Who was once tireless have become tired in my labors to free you. What resting place have you to give me, that I may take my Sabbath?' 'We have only this borrowed barrow, the grave of a stranger.' 'This will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, He made it the doorway to harrowed Hell and hallowed Heaven. And the people who had walked in darkness saw the great Light. God had become naked for them. God had become homeless for them. God had become throneless for them. God had become limited for them. God had become hungry for them. God had become thirsty for them. God had become crownless for them. God had become weaponless for them. God had died for them. God had become one of them. And they said, 'We call Him Emmanuel, for God is truly with us.' And so it was that, in obedience and humility, the Son took all that He was given and made it blessed. And all that had been laid aside was returned to Him, power, throne, crown, robes and glory. He turned again to earth and said, 'My children, you have no gifts, for all that was once Mine is restored to me. What tribute have you to give me, that I may know of your love?' 'We have only our failing flesh, our weak wills and our poor hearts, but we give them to You to do with as you would.' 'These will I take,' He replied. Yet, in the taking, God-with-us changed our names to we-with-God.",a9bokf,self.Catholicism,,True

Take the First Step and Rejoice!,Catholicism,"I write these reflections for my parish bulletin each week. If there is interest, I can post them here as well (don't be afraid to tell me that there is no interest). &#x200B; # Take the First Step and Rejoice! Sunday’s Gospel tells of the people who came to John the Baptist for baptism. Each asked what they must do to prepare their hearts for the coming of the Lord. To the soldiers and tax-collectors, those most steeped in sin, he tells them to turn away from that sin. But everyone else he invites to participate in what will come to be known as Christian justice. To share with our neighbors in need is a call that echoes throughout the New Testament. And it is a call that is easy to answer this time of year. Your mail box is full of appeals from different charities and you see the Salvation Army bell-ringers outside many stores. But the call is not just to share money – although that certainly helps. It is also to share ourselves with our neighbors. God calls on us to expand our love for him so much that our love extends to our neighbors. There are many ways you can share yourself during this holiday season. Look around your neighborhood to see if there is a neighbor that needs help. Perhaps you have noticed someone missing from Sunday mass; you can look in on them to see if they are ill and need anything. Your family can make Christmas cards for the residents of nearby nursing homes to lighten the days of those away from their families this time of year. Perhaps you know a Catholic that has been away from the Church for a while. You can invite them to join your family at Sunday mass. Sunday’s Gospel tells us to take that first step. Turn away from sin, and then share our love for God with our neighbor. As we do this, we will feel God’s love in return. We can then truly “Rejoice!” for we will be ready for the coming of our Lord. &#x200B;",a6uehd,self.Catholicism,,True

Reflection for the Fourth Sunday in Advent,Catholicism," The Perfect Disciple As we approach the celebration of the day where “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,” we look back over this season of Advent and see that we have been talking quite a bit about the Virgin Mary. We celebrated the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, Mary’s conception free from sin (or full of grace, as we say in the Hail Mary), and then the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patroness of the Americas and the patroness of the Diocese of Orange. This Sunday’s Gospel also focuses on Mary. Gabriel greeted Mary as royalty (“Hail Mary”), and conveyed God’s invitation to Mary to be the mother of Christ (Holy Mary, mother of God). Despite the exalted greeting, Mary responded as servant (“behold the handmaid of the Lord”), and then rushed to serve her cousin Elizabeth after Gabriel told Mary that Elizabeth was also pregnant. Mary carried in her womb the Gospel, the Good News of our Salvation, bringing the “Word made flesh” not just to her cousin, but to the whole world. By submitting her will to God (“be it done unto me according to your will”) and then serving her cousin, Mary shows the way of humble discipleship. We too are called to be disciples. We are Christ’s hands and He is sending us to our neighbors to share His love. Even here in Orange County it turns cool in December and January. Take one of those coats you have hanging in your closet and give it to someone who has no coat or needs a new one. Show them the light of Christ shining through you. Follow Mary’s example of discipleship as we prepare for the day that the Word becomes flesh and dwells among us. h",a8xzhi,self.Catholicism,,True

Reflection on the Feast of the Holy Family,Catholicism," Church and Family Admit it. Sometimes you get a little annoyed when a baby cries during Mass or young children make loud noises (that are definitely not part of the liturgy). You might even see a young child running down the aisle, or a frustrated parent needing to climb over people in the pew to take their child outside for a few minutes in the middle of Mass. You might say to yourself – what are these parents thinking bringing their young children to church like that? One thing they might be thinking is that their children belong in their Father’s house. The readings for this Feast of the Holy Family are all about Family and Church. In the Book of Samuel, Sarah prays for a son and when her prayers are answered, she willingly gives her son to Eli to be raised in the Temple. She recognized that her gift from God was not for her alone and that her son belonged in God’s house. In the Gospel, it is the child Jesus who tells His parents where He belongs. “Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” We often read “my Father’s house” as something unique to Jesus as the Son of God. But Jesus tells us throughout the Gospel that God is our Father too. Through Jesus, we became the adopted sons and daughters of God. Indeed, He taught us to pray “Our Father.” The Holy Family is not *just* Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Our families are meant to be holy too. We too are the sons and daughters of God and we too belong in our Father’s house. Sunday Mass is a good way to start. But on Friday January 4, we also have our 24 hours of adoration, starting after the 8:00 am Mass. Start the new year by coming to your Father’s house and thanking Jesus for our adoption into His Family. And remember that that a crying baby or noisy toddler belongs in his and her Father’s House too.",ab1zbn,self.Catholicism,,True

What are the Christmas and Easter Vigil Masses like in your home parish?,Catholicism,"These two profoundly special Masses in my home parish have long been terribly painful events. I think this has largely been due to a combination of weak/uninterested pastors, ignorant and highly territorial church ladies, poor taste and the septic effects of the annual Los Angeles Religious Education Conference. Let’s see, there were the holiday decorations that included a number of just plain ugly felt banners. They brought me back to my childhood days where we learned how to make banners rather than learn about our Catholic faith. I wonder if the church lady who still struggles to place these banners at the top of the stairs to the sanctuary (thus making things even more difficult for the aged/handicapped) is trying to relive her childhood? I hope she has stopped. Speaking of the elderly and inform, they’ll provide plenty of rest periods during the Mass when they struggle to navigate the steps in and out of the sanctuary. Forget Mass beauty! Forget Mass fluidity! Forget choosing the reader with the best abilities. These people have a right to take “active participation” in the Mass! Vatican II said so – at least until the first one goes down hard and fractures a hip. Then there is the livestock trough (thanks Tractor Supply!) covered in crepe paper that were used to baptize people. The old font just wouldn’t suffice anymore, because, you know, the sister in the powder blue pantsuit and magenta Crocs at the Los Angeles Religious Education Conference said so. Even worse was the Rube Goldberg contraption that some people called a “waterfall.” Not only did it generate enough noise to drown out the preaching (not always a bad thing) it allowed the liturgical dancer to refill her large brass ewer while prancing around the trough. She would then dance a lap (no pun) around the sanctuary with the ewer overhead. before dumping its contents back into the trough and repeating. Sometimes the liturgical dancers dressed like Barbara Eden in *I Dream of Jeanie.* Add a fire-pole to the sanctuary and I suspect donations would have skyrocketed from some. Talk about “love notes”! The readers (excuse me, “lectors”, LOL!) were always good for a few painful laughs. There was a micro-scandal among the readers several years back. It seems that reading at either vigil Mass was closed (like a guild) to anyone who was not a church lady (of either gender) – even if they were more competent than those scheduled. People were really upset at the situation. I wonder if it was ever resolved? In any event they were better than the deacon with reading difficulties. The one with the fancy, oversize *evangeliary* (he carried it overhead like a surfboard) who sounded like he gargled with leaded gasoline (or some other volatile solvent) before Mass began. The EMHC corps was always interesting to watch. Particularly the female members who insisted on wearing tight, clingy and otherwise immodest clothes – when they had no business doing so. I wonder if those who asked father to outlaw communion-on-the-tongue (because it’s “yucky”) are still plying their trade? I sure hope not. I wonder if they still pre-open the tabernacle before Mass and leave the key in the door, to, you know, make things easier? This repugnant practice also screams “no, security of the Blessed Sacrament is no longer an utmost concern of ours. Just relax, and try not to be too Pope Benedict XVI, will you?” I wonder if the former “liturgy coordinator” (who everyone ignored) is still making wild hand-signals from her front row box seat, in her quest to control things? Lord, I hope not. One thing is for certain – the Mass “captain” with nothing to do – much like a fireman on an electric train that keeps their job due to union regulations, will be standing in the middle of the sanctuary during communion, looking as important and concerned as they possibly can. Then again, we have a fairly new pastor on board. I understand at his direction, the last Easter Vigil Mass was greatly improved. Could there really be hope? I’d like to experience a nice Christmas Vigil Mass without having to leave town. Maybe I’ll give it a shot? Do I dare?",a98not,self.Catholicism,,True

Examination of consciousness,Catholicism,"So I have been praying this week for guidance as my thoughts have been muddled and this week has been especially stressful at work. Before sleeping last night I began to do an examination of consciousness. Reflecting on the week and how stressed I've been; specifically how angry and uncharitable towards my coworkers and some of the staff. There were other things that I reflected on too. But those I think are discipline and various relationship issues. I feel rather down and sad. I'm looking forward fo Mass in an hour, with the insense and music. However I wonder how I can be better in dealing with my sins. In continuing going to Mass and more fully living the church's teachings daily. Any advice on examination and help, I guess this is a rather open ended question. ",a6qjpi,self.Catholicism,,True

I asked him in passing if the Symbolon DVD can help out with his seminars, but it's mostly apologetics. He prefers exegetical content so he can use and apply it to the discussions in his seminars. Do you have any recommendations for exegetical DVDs I can get for him? Thank you in advance!",a771u2,self.Catholicism,,True

Postmodernism... started a long time ago.,Catholicism,"Postmodernism has not started recently. The foundation, if such a thing even exists in postmodernism, expressed Derrida's sentence: 'There is nothig outside the text. ' The second translation is 'There is no outside text'. Postmodernism negates every authority, destroys every community, every tradition, every story, role and structure that sustains man and brings man to protest before the very existence and then destroys man ultimately because it leads to nihilism. But this problem did not begin yesterday, nor was Derrida the first to formulate it. That was actually the father of modern times - Martin Luther. 'Sola Scriptura' is actually the first expression of the negation of the 1500-year tradition, the denial of authority set up 'from above', the denial of hierarchy, the negation of the church as such ... Everyone who can read, from now on can be the church itself, and to this day we have at least 40,000 different denominations claiming that the right church - every reading of the 'Bible itself' potentially creates a new denomination - because it is an expression of protest. So, how can a man be cured from this postmodernism christianity? Any thoughts, sugestions, corrections? &#x200B; &#x200B;",a9irqt,self.Catholicism,,True

Fixing a failure with mercy,Catholicism,"I’m so proud to be a part of my parish. Yes, there are things I wish my pastor did differently, but he consistently exhibits mercy. A family in our parish has been struggling with a child with autism. He really has a difficult time at Mass. Our parish has failed this family. People laughed at this child’s behaviors. No one, myself included, offered help. Our pastor gave a short homily about inclusion today, and then he turned the microphone over to a mom of a child on the spectrum, who gave a lesson about autism and sensory processing disorder. It was pretty eye-opening. Our pastor teared up talking about being accepting and kind. The whole thing was sobering and inspiring. I’m so thankful he did this. He and the mom who presented are also doing other things to help this family (they mentioned creating a bag of sensory tools and toys for the back of the church to help individuals with autism handle Mass). I’m glad they’re helping this family and others. It made me proud of my parish.

Advice Requested- What Can I Do for the Church?,Catholicism,"My life is a little complicated right now. American here-- I'm originally from a city in State X and lived in that city almost my entire life. I lost my job in State X and couldn't find a similar job (or anything close to it) in my city or 3 neighboring cities of significant reputation. Desperate, I moved to State Y, 1,000 miles from State X, two years ago. &#x200B; The nature of my work requires me to spend 2/3rds of the year in State Y, but I have the liberty to spend the remaining 1/3rd of the year in my hometown located in State X. My goal is to eventually move back to State X, but I haven't found suitable employment there. So I am left with asking you for advice /Catholicism/: &#x200B; I'm torn between 2 dioceses in 2 states. I'm registered as a parishioner at a church in State X, but I have not registered with a parish in State Y, though I do regularly . I'm not active in any ministries at either parish, but I want to help the Church, for reasons too numerous to list and detail here. How can I help both parishes that I attend, given that I'm only a part-time parishioner at one and just a weekly visitor at the other? Is it as simple as reaching out to the respective pastors? How can I go about expressing my willingness to help without being awkward about it? Thanks! &#x200B; &#x200B;",a7ipwx,self.Catholicism,,True

(BTW, if you're anti-charismatic renewal, that's fine, ignore it, but I don't want to debate it. The debate is tangential to my question.) What I'm trying to think about is how Theology of the Body integrates with the other major modern theological/spiritual movements and what insights it can offer, either from a theological perspective or from a spiritual/mystical/putting-faith-in-practice perspective.

Thank the good Lord that He has found me.,Catholicism,"All my life, I have been wandering to and fro, wondering where I can safely plant my feet. I tried college, the mission, being Mormon, the Evangelical church, my job, everything, and I could not find it within myself to stick around. I always hit a wall, always cane up empty, always hit a logical end to where I could go, always looking for those around me to give me a sense of peace I have never had within myself. And always, always coming up empty and miserable. Yet, through all of this, the good Lord was by my side. He tugged me in a right direction, and when I would willfully abandon Him, he would be right there, waiting for me to come back. Through all of my periods of desolation and the out of despair, He has been slowly shaving away the miserable man I thought I was. Bit by bit, he was whittled away my core and turned me into a far more complete man than I have any right to be. I don’t know what the future holds. Perhaps tomorrow I will die, perhaps my company will go bankrupt, perhaps the USA will cease to exist as we know it and transform into an empire. Whatever happens, I know that it is good to exist, it is good to be here, it is good for me to live, and that, most of all, the Lord is good to me. In fact, He is far better to me than I can ever deserve. And all I want to do is share that goodness with everyone around me that will listen.",a7ddhf,self.Catholicism,,True

Eucharistic Insight from Feast of the Holy Family Liturgy,Catholicism,"The Communion Antiphon text (from the Roman Gradual) reiterates the Gospel reading, Mary's discovery of Jesus in the temple, and her saying that she and Joseph had been looking for him for three days, anxiously. And Jesus responded that did she not know that he was to be in His Father's house? There is a companion text that is based off of Psalm 27 (26) where one of the verses is the following: 'One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. ... **For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle**; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.' Juxtaposing this with the liturgical action of that moment, it was a vivid reminder how, we, at times, may furiously seek for God, not knowing where He is, not knowing He is fully present in the tabernacles at church, or an Adoration chapel, across the globe. That we can be anxious, and sorrowful, but Christ remains, as He must remain, in His Father's house. We need only to be cognizant that this is where He is, and we should attend there to seek after Him, to learn from Him, and to engage with Him.

An idea on submission,Catholicism,"We often see 'when don't I have to submit' questions. Parents, governments, spouses etc. We spend a bit of time qualifying their authority and in many of the cases knowing we have the means to defeat these authorities. A false call to any numerous phone numbers can destroy a parent or spouse. Even a semi-true but craftily told story can change the context quite rapidly to give any subordinate an army of armed men ready to destroy the authority over them. So a question we should ask ourselves, in many ways. How good could we submit to God if we had an army to fight Him? Before you're ready to excuse whatever it is you want to do, perhaps we should reflect on this notion. I can say with a bit of convinced opinion most of anyone whose main motivator is 'I'm scared of hell' would certainly not follow God if they thought they could defeat Him and avoid hell.

Other Christian’s views on “kecharitomene”,Catholicism,"The question I have is most other non-Catholic bibles you will find “highly favored” when referring to Luke 1:28. Now, the typical Catholic translation is “full of grace”. Why do Protestants have a hard time accepting any elevation of Mary to more than just a “woman” as she was addressed at the wedding at Cana? With this being said, why do other translations (seemingly intentionally) translate it “highly favored” if when broken down “kecharitomene” clearly indicates a person or thing (in this case Mary) put into the state indicated (in this case grace, because of the root “charis”), in the past, while being in a perfect and completed present state as a result of past action, by another (in this case, God)?

Beautiful reading on The Feast of the Holy Innocents,Catholicism,"St. Quodvultdeus (Carthage, circa 425 A.D.) *Quodvultdeus on the story recounted in Matthew’s gospel of the slaughter of innumerable babies in Bethlehem by Herod’s soldiers in an attempt to kill Jesus, the newborn king. These children are considered martyrs and are remembered on the Feast of the Holy Innocents, December 28, the 4th of the 12 days of Christmas.* A tiny child is born, who is a great king. Wise men are led to him from afar. They come to adore one who lies in a manger and yet reigns in heaven and on earth. When they tell of one who is born a king, Herod is disturbed. To save his kingdom he resolves to kill him, though if he would have faith in the child, he himself would reign in peace in this life and forever in the life to come. Why are you afraid, Herod, when you hear of the birth of a king? He does not come to drive you out, but to conquer the devil. But because you do not understand this you are disturbed and in a rage, and to destroy one child whom you seek, you show your cruelty in the death of so many children. You are not restrained by the love of weeping mothers or fathers mourning the deaths of their sons, nor by the cries and sobs of the children. You destroy those who are tiny in body because fear is destroying your heart. You imagine that if you accomplish your desire you can prolong your own life, though you are seeking to kill Life himself. Yet your throne is threatened by the source of grace, so small, yet so great, who is lying in the manger. He is using you, all unaware of it, to work out his own purposes freeing souls from captivity to the devil. He has taken up the sons of the enemy into the ranks of God’s adopted children. The children die for Christ, though they do not know it. The parents mourn for the death of martyrs. The child makes of those as yet unable to speak fit witnesses to himself. See the kind of kingdom that is his, coming as he did in order to be this kind of king. See how the deliverer is already working deliverance, the savior already working salvation. But you, Herod, do not know this and are disturbed and furious. While you vent your fury against the child, you are already paying him homage, and do not know it. How great a gift of grace is here! To what merits of their own do the children owe this kind of victory? They cannot speak, yet they bear witness to Christ. They cannot use their limbs to engage in battle, yet already they bear off the palm of victory! ",aa81ei,self.Catholicism,,True
A lovely Marian meditation paraphrased from Thomas Merton,Catholicism,"Thomas Merton copped a lot of (reasonably unfair) criticism from some corners, but this is one of the most beautiful, and illuminating things I have read about Mary: 'There is a bit of the Orient in this very Western little building. On one side of the fireplace there hands a parasol which Suzuki sent Tom; on the other, a beautiful Madonna from Japan - a wonderful blending of the East and the West.' Tom did not speak much about Mary or write much about her. He had a very simple and human devotion to her as mother. Speaking to the novices, he urged them to be perfectly human in their devotion; to have the emotions of a child without being sentimental. Tom himself wanted to live in total dependence on Mary. We can never be detached from her. Ever movement of grace comes through her. This does not detract from Jesus; this is his will. It shows forth the fullness of the incarnation, how completely God has placed his power in the human milieu. In 1962 Tom preached on the feast of the Immaculate Conception. The priests of the community are assigned different feasts on which to preach to the community. In those days it was only on feasts ; now we preach also on Sundays. In his sermon Tom spoke of Mary as light, the woman clothed in the sun, the new Jerusalem. God put man and woman into the material creation as its light, but they were quickly extinguished. In the covenanting with Abraham, then with Moses, God sought to rekindle the light, coming to them in fire. But the people withdrew in fear. Then, in many ways, God sought to make his light present, at least in glimmers, preparing for the time when the Light of the World would come. Mary fully received that light. There was no drawing back, only a complete *fiat -* 'Be it as you will.' What God wants and will accomplish in all the universe is already accomplished in Mary. This is the meaning of her being drawn up into heaven in her body at the Assumption. She is the Star of the Sea to guide us all home. She is conceived immaculate so that the light can shine through her wholly unimpeded. How beautifully does the Japanese Madonna, with her extraordinary delicateness, bespeak a lamp, a vessel of light, a shrine for the true Light which enlightens us all.'

Question about blessing,Catholicism,"I just bought a beautiful St Benedict rosary: the medal is a St Benedict medal and the Our Father beads are also smaller St Benedict medals. I was doing a bit of research about sacramentals yesterday and found out there are special formulas for blessing certain sacramentals beyond a generic quick blessing a priest might impart. I have never approached a priest to bless an item before since I'm new to the faith, so I'm very conscious of doing this in the 'right way'. Would I ask for the rosary to be blessed and then the St Benedict medals separately using the proper formula for St Benedict medals, or both rosary and medals at the same time using the formula, or would a regular run of the mill blessing of the rosary at the same time afford the same sacramental property to the medals? I know a blessing is a blessing is a blessing, but at the same time we have the specific formulae for the various sacramentals for good reasons. I would much appreciate a bit of clarification.

Peter Canisius and a note on defending the Faith.,Catholicism,"After hearing briefly about this Saint whom I was unfamiliar with at this morning mass, I decided to look up some further information on his life and works. He was a Jesuit at the height of the early Reformation period and defended the Faith remarkably well in the home country of Luther himself, Germany. This is from his wiki page, so take it with a grain of salt... In speaking of personal polemical attacks against the Reformers, which the Church seemed to use enthusiastically during this time, the Saint said, '*With words like these, we don’t cure patients, we make them incurable*.' He was far more favorable of clear catechesis as opposed to sensational attacks against protestants themselves. I personally cannot stand when Catholics revert to saying things like, 'Protestants are just in church for an entertaining and emotional atmosphere.' Or 'Ha! 30,000 different denominations!' or 'Their theology is so horribly flawed, have they even read James 2!' &#x200B; ESPECIALLY when that same Catholic doesn't really understand the beliefs and theology of the protestant they're speaking to, and worse, nor do they have a clear understanding of Catholicism themselves! It's at the least immature and stupid, maybe insane, and in some cases, possibly demonic. Nothing *natural* has sharpened my own personal faith more than encountering protestants and protestantism. Their theology makes sense, good sense most of the time. Catholicism DOESN'T come naturally, and doesn't immediately make sense, at least not for most people. I'm still wrestling over the intersection of Sacramentality and the Atonement myself. Things are coming together, but none of this is a simple 'read this and this, then you'll understand.' That's just not how Apostolic Christianity developed nor came about. I'm starting to rant now, but keep in mind, unless you can articulate your own faith well, and with Charity, than we shouldn't be saying a word about the errors of protestantism or any other religion or spirituality for that matter. &#x200B; &#x200B;",a8bqc7,self.Catholicism,,True

St. Anselm helps broaden my understanding of the Trinity,Catholicism,">I was reading a sermon by Saint Anselm today, here is the full thing: Blessed Lady, sky and stars, earth and rivers, day and night – everything that is subject to the power or use of man – rejoice that through you they are in some sense restored to their lost beauty and are endowed with inexpressible new grace. All creatures were dead, as it were, useless for men or for the praise of God, who made them. The world, contrary to its true destiny, was corrupted and tainted by the acts of men who served idols. Now all creation has been restored to life and rejoices that it is controlled and given splendour by men who believe in God. The universe rejoices with new and indefinable loveliness. Not only does it feel the unseen presence of God himself, its Creator, it sees him openly, working and making it holy. These great blessings spring from the blessed fruit of Mary’s womb. Through the fullness of the grace that was given you, dead things rejoice in their freedom, and those in heaven are glad to be made new. Through the Son who was the glorious fruit of your virgin womb, just souls who died before his life-giving death rejoice as they are freed from captivity, and the angels are glad at the restoration of their shattered domain. Lady, full and overflowing with grace, all creation receives new life from your abundance. Virgin, blessed above all creatures, through your blessing all creation is blessed, not only creation from its Creator, but the Creator himself has been blessed by creation. To Mary God gave his only-begotten Son, whom he loved as himself. Through Mary God made himself a Son, not different but the same, by nature Son of God and Son of Mary. The whole universe was created by God, and God was born of Mary. God created all things, and Mary gave birth to God. The God who made all things gave himself form through Mary, and thus he made his own creation. He who could create all things from nothing would not remake his ruined creation without Mary. **God, then, is the Father of the created world and Mary the mother of the re-created world. God is the Father by whom all things were given life, and Mary the mother through whom all things were given new life. For God begot the Son, through whom all things were made, and Mary gave birth to him as the Saviour of the world. Without God’s Son, nothing could exist; without Mary’s Son, nothing could be redeemed.** Truly the Lord is with you, to whom the Lord granted that all nature should owe as much to you as to himself. The highlighted text really stood out to me. God is God who made all things. God is Jesus the word made flesh, who redeems all things. The Holy Spirit, well: But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid,Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. **14** He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, **15** for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink,and **he will be filled with the Holy Spirit** even before he is born. Mary said to the angel, ‘But how can this come about, since I am a virgin?’ ‘**The Holy Spirit will come upon you**’ the angel answered ‘and **the power of the Most High will cover you with its shadow**. The Holy Spirit is God manifesting within us, guiding us to greater deeds. “If you love me, keep my commands. **16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—17 the Spirit of truth.** The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be\\] in you. **18** I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.**19** Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me**.Because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.** What can I say, we believe because he has revealed them, who can neither deceive or be deceived. Happy reminder of the Immaculate Conception everyone. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;",a49ukk,self.Catholicism,,True

"Gregory of Nyssa, Christianity's First Abolitionist",Catholicism,"Excerpt from Gregory's 4th homily on Ecclesiastes, delivered 379 AD 'I got me slaves and slave-girls.'[Ecclesiastes 2:7] For what price, tell me? What did you find in existence worth as much as this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling the being shaped by God? God said, let us make man in our own image and likeness (Gen 1,26). If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable (Rom 11,29). God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's? How too shall the ruler of the whole earth and all earthly things be put up for sale? For the property of the person sold is bound to be sold with him, too. So how much do we think the whole earth is worth? And how much all the things on the earth (Gen 1,26)? If they are priceless, what price is the one above them worth, tell me? Though you were to say the whole world, even so you have not found the price he is worth (Mat 16,26; Mk 8,36). He who knew the nature of mankind rightly said that the whole world was not worth giving in exchange for a human soul. Whenever a human being is for sale, therefore, nothing less than the owner of the earth is led into the sale-room. Presumably, then, the property belonging to him is up for auction too. sea, and all that is in them. That means the earth, the islands, the What will the buyer pay, and what will the vendor accept, considering how much property is entailed in the deal? But has the scrap of paper, and the written contract, and the counting out of obols deceived you into thinking yourself the master of the image of God? What folly! If the contract were lost, if the writing were eaten away by worms, if a drop of water should somehow seep in and obliterate it, what guarantee have you of their slavery? what have you to sustain your title as owner? I see no superiority over the subordinate accruing to you from the title other than the mere title. What does this power contribute to you as a person? not longevity, nor beauty, nor good health, nor superiority in virtue. Your origin is from the same ancestors, your life is of the same kind, sufferings of soul and body prevail alike over you who own him and over the one who is subject to your ownership - pains and pleasures, merriment and distress, sorrows and delights, rages and terrors, sickness and death. Is there any difference in these things between the slave and his owner? Do they not draw in the same air as they breathe? Do they not see the sun in the same way? Do they not alike sustain their being by consuming food? Is not the arrangement of their guts the same? Are not the two one dust after death? Is there not one judgment for them? a common Kingdom, and a common Gehenna?",a7kgmh,self.Catholicism,,True

What do you think: Is this famous man from Germany secretly christian?,Catholicism,"In Germany there is a very famous singer-songwriter, who is successful since the late 60s. His name is Reinhard Mey. I love his music. He's singing about the ups and downs of life in very fun, caring, sad and poetical ways. His lyrics are full of altruism, charity, love of your neighbor. You would think that he's a christian. But in a book released in the early 2000s he said, he is not a christian and is highly critical of 'organised religion'. He is aware though, because of his lyrics, that it can seem that he is a christian. Now on the last tour he quoted Psalm 90. In one of his songs he mentioned the 'letters/epistles of the apostles' in a positive way, in another one how a person raised his hand like a prophet to the sky. There were many more christian references and biblical imagery. In an interview 2014 he was asked this question: 'Which event has been the most dramatic for the world?' His answer was: 'The creation in seven days.' Would a person opposed to Christianity not say something different? If he doesn't believe in the Bible, wouldn't he say something like 'The Beginning of the Universe' or so? I also remember an academic article on the internet, which I can't find anymore, that made the case, that Mey is a secret Christian. But why would he do that? Why would he hide his faith? My thought: He doesn't want to get branded as a christian singer-songwriter. But I really don't know. What's your opinion? &#x200B; &#x200B;",a4t5di,self.Catholicism,,True

Is this a mortal sin?,Catholicism,"I sometimes have debilitating anxiety from my school schedule and life in general, and my friend gives me 0.25 mg of clonazepam for it when this happens (that's a very small dose). I can't really afford a doctor's visit to get my own prescription right now. I have had anxiety throughout my life btw and been put on numerous medications. I'm also afraid to see a doctor because they might want to put me on something 24/7 but I try to manage my anxiety on my own and it usually works. Sometimes, I just need help sleeping and relaxing because I'm high strung - that's where the medication comes in. I'm also afraid the doctor will make me see a psychiatrist because of my traumatic past - but for me, seeing one and talking about the trauma is even worse - I have found way more healing in converting to Catholicism than seeing a shrink or a counselor. Anyway, am I committing a mortal sin by doing this? Is my friend?

The greatest Christmas gift I've recieved in a while: Attending Tridentine Mass for the first time,Catholicism,"This past Friday I had the pleasure to attend for the first time a Tridentine mass (a 'low mass') and this morning the midnight solemn high mass of our Lord's Nativity at a parish that's part of the FSSP. A little background, I was raised exclusively in the Novus Ordo, my first Parish in my hometown didn't have kneelers and it wasn't until middle school that (much to my surprise) I learned that the Mass for most of the Church's history was celebrated in what is now called the 'extraordinary form'. &#x200B; Although it was a bit different than I expected, I had done some reading beforehand and for the most part wasn't caught off guard as to what I was participating and praying in and soon found myself really liking it. The atmosphere of the church and the liturgy just felt so much more reverent and oddly enough intuitive in a number of ways: * The logic of having the Priest face away from the congregation made so much more sense when actually experiencing the mass (The Mass being one massive prayer just seemed so much more immediate when my attention was off of where/who my eyes should be focusing on during the mass) The Priests focus was on God and by extension the congregation is as well. * The reception of communion from the Priest alone and on the tongue while kneeling immediately forces one to accept the physical presence of Christ in the Eucharist. * The use of Latin makes the faith UNIVERSAL like the name 'Catholic' suggests, as well as fostering a feeling a connection to the history of the church. * Male only altar-servers to foster possible vocations to the priesthood ** ** * A small but important part I noticed during the solemn high mass was how the choir was not visible nor located anywhere near the altar, my focus was on the mass itself moreso than the spectacle of the choir (who sounded beautiful singing traditional songs and not post 1950 songs that make me cringe) My friend who offered to drive me to both of the Masses (the church being an hours drive away) gave me a truly amazing gift this Christmas by allowing me to experience this part of my faith that I wish I had been exposed to sooner.

I think I experience a message of some kind from God today. I found what I think is some kind of rosary.,Catholicism,"I recently posted coming back to the church after awhile. It's in my history if you care. The past weekend was pretty rough on me. My mom is sick, my old dog isn't doing so well either, and a lot of other personal things. I came back to the church because though I consider myself an agnostic I could feel something pulling me back. Things more than just simple conincidences. I went to church this Saturday. I also asked him to give me guidance and perhaps give me a sign of some kind. Not just any sign like a shadow making a cross or two blades of grass that make a cross but something a bit more tangible. I still didn't feel totally convinced. I was thinking about my mom, my family, and my dog. I was also thinking of death, afterlife and just felt very lost and somewhat depressed and anxious. However, on my way back from getting the trash I found some broken beads. I looked at them  and it looks like some kind of rosary based on the spacing but it seems to have too many beads to be that. Maybe I'm reading too much into this but I really do feel like me finding these beads means something but I'm not sure what. Does anyone know what this is or if it's related?",a52x97,self.Catholicism,,True
1 Samuel 15:3 response,Catholicism," First of if you read 1 Samuel 15:1-2 it's clearly a reference to Deuteronomy 25:17-18 and Exodus 17:8-16 1 Samuel 15:1-2 (RSVCE) And Samuel said to Saul, “The Lord sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore hearken to the words of the Lord. 2 Thus says the Lord of hosts, ‘I will punish what Am′alek did to Israel in opposing them on the way, when they came up out of Egypt &#x200B; Deuteronomy 25:17-18 (RSVCE) 17 “Remember what Am′alek did to you on the way as you came out of Egypt, 18 how he attacked you on the way, when you were faint and weary, and cut off at your rear all who lagged behind you; and he did not fear God. &#x200B; Exodus 17:8-16 (RSVCE) 8 Then came Am′alek and fought with Israel at Reph′idim. 9 And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Am′alek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.” 10 So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Am′alek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 11 Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered his hand, Am′alek prevailed. 12 But Moses’ hands grew weary; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it, and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; so his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 13 And Joshua mowed down Am′alek and his people with the edge of the sword. 14 And the Lord said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Am′alek from under heaven.” 15 And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The Lord is my banner, 16 saying, “A hand upon the banner of the Lord!\[a\] The Lord will have war with Am′alek from generation to generation.” &#x200B; As you read the context. The Amalekites attacked the Israelites first while Yahweh freed the Israelites from Egypt when they were in slavery and later Yahweh punished them in self-defense. So no the divine judgment were upon them. I could tackle even more but that should be evidence enough. It's ironic that Muslims cry for out of context yet they take the holy Bible out of context.﻿ &#x200B; &#x200B;",a9vw98,self.Catholicism,,True

Gluttony and being a good as opposed to being non-evil,Catholicism,"Gluttony, as St. Thomas Aquinas defined it, is an excessive indulgence in the pleasures of food and drink. Rightly so, this definition does not vilify pleasure itself, but rather decrees that it is possible to overindulge in those pleasures to such an extent that it is harmful to one's spirit by replacing spiritual nourishment in our lives. But when exactly is one a glutton, and how can you tell? Certainly someone who is obese is gluttonous, but what if you are overweight? You are certainly feeding your body more than it needs, but is that immoral? Since it is wrong to overindulge in food and drink, someone who does not overindulge in food and drink is being non-evil. However, what does the good/virtuous counterpart really entail? Just fasting and not eating so much that it hurts your body? Or should we all strive for a normal level of fat that is aesthetically appealing? Is it virtuous to take care of your body really well by dieting and exercising a lot, or does it not really matter?",abcq20,self.Catholicism,,True

Marriage Validity Questions,Catholicism,"In short, I know a few couples who are close friends, baptized Catholic, and married in the Church, but lapsed to some degree or another. Some of the details have made me wonder whether the circumstances would be enough for the either marriages to be potentially or presumptively invalid. (I realize that only the situation at the time of the marriage, and nothing afterward can affect the validity of a marriage). For the first couple, both are baptized Catholic and practicing at least enough to regularly attend Sunday Mass. However, they were living and sleeping together prior to marriage, and lied to the priest about this during marriage prep in order to avoid any resistance. The husband (and maybe the wife as well) also actively disagrees with Church teaching on a number of issues; typical modernist stuff. With the second couple, the wife was baptized and raised Catholic, but the husband is a lifelong evangelical Protestant. They were married in the Church, with the accompanying vow on her part to try to raise the children Catholic, and by him not to impede that. However, while she still considers herself Catholic, they live as Protestants, and only attend Mass a few times a year when her side of the family visits. It's unlikely that either of them had any intention of raising the kids Catholic, even at the beginning. So, would either or both of these situations result in an invalid marriage?

Currently my job forces me to work every other Sunday (I managed to get my boss to allow me every other Sunday off) - but even when I go to work on Sundays I am always asking if it's possible if I can go home. Sometimes they do. It's aggrevating to me. I didn't know I was supposed to abstain from servile work before I took the job, I only knew I had to show up to Mass in the morning. * 3 - Is it a sin to encourage others' servile work by going to the market, eating a restaurant, etc? If not sinful is it just disliked? * 4 - How about if you take part in something you paid for previously, but it enacts something like a subscription - for example Netflix for World of Warcraft. Where you don't actually *buy* anything on the Lord's Day, but you are still partaking in the transaction? * 5 - Should Christians refrain from house chores on the Lord's Day as well? * 6 - Should Christians refrain from physical exercise on the Lord's Day? I read somewhere the Lord's Day and abstaining from servile work is to refresh the 'mind and body' - but exercise tires out the body * 7 - Besides going to the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, praying the daily prayers of the Divine Office, praying the Rosary or other chaplets, and reading Scripture/Patristics/Summa/Non-canonical writings on the Lord's Day how should a Christian properly 'recharge' themselves? Thanks, blessed Advent and Lord's Day! ",a4r8ax,self.Catholicism,,True

Question,Catholicism,"I’m in a group text message with all my friends from high school (I’m in college now) and they keep sending these really inappropriate photos. Not something that would be sexually arousing, but something sexual in nature if that makes sense. As a joke. Which I think is not ok and not appropriate. My friends aren’t exactly aligned with me on moral things, but they are my long time friends. Involuntarily they made me laugh. I wish this wasn’t the case. But I also didn’t want to see them. When I saw they were sent, I went to view them to get it over with so I didn’t have to see it later, which made me laugh. For some odd reason my laughing was giving a very strange tingling feeling in my genitals. I don’t know if it was related to the pictures or what. But I kept viewing the pictures every time they were sent so I didn’t have to view them later. Was me going back to view them a mortal sin because of this laughing issue that was causing the tingling feeling and slight arousal? Was any of this a mortal sin? I viewed all the pictures as little as I could as I hid the messages. Please don’t say anything along the lines of “get new friends.” These are long time friends who probably haven’t matured as quick as I have.",a541p6,self.Catholicism,,True

Wanted to share these words with my Catholic Reddit family.,Catholicism,"From Fr. John Bartunik. The human soul yearns for forgiveness – to know that it is loved unconditionally, generously, no matter what; the human mind longs for light – to know the truth of things, the reason it exists, where it is going, the meaning of life and the path to fulfillment; and all people and all communities pine above all for peace – the peace that is so much more than a mere absence of war, the peace that is fullness, prosperity, goodness, social harmony, creative expansiveness, cultural flourishing” God’s Savior comes to bring all of these mighty gifts. He comes, as John the Baptist will announce, to inaugurate a New Creation, a New Covenant that will end in an everlastingly fruitful life. That’s our Lord. (This touched my heart and having no one at home with which to share it, I am sharing with you. Merry Christmas and God bless.) Edit: to clear a misunderstanding. This post is NOT from Fr.

' The man who unwillingly became the mouthpiece of a liberal reform movement in 2018 does not consider himself to be particularly progressive.

Is it okay to set limit on oneself in regards to fasting/penance/etc?,Catholicism,"I suffer a lot from scrupulosity and it tends to be most worst whenever I try to go gung ho in my spirituality. For example, if I see value in fasting I begin to feel as though I should fast everything in sight. Since I don't have a spiritual director I am a bit worried that I will harm myself (spiritually/emotionally) by becoming too scrupulous and fearful of anything that doesn't immediately lift me up to God (for example, air conditioning). The two things I am considering are only fasting (from something that isn't already an excess or obviously detrimental to my faith) when I'm doing it out of love vs begrudgingly. And secondly to not worry about desires that aren't necessarily keeping me from God (for example, in this case I wouldn't fast from sleeping in my bed since it does not appear to be an immediate hindrance). I'm trying to discern whether these rules are just an easy way out of fasting, or perhaps something that I should do as I try to rid my life of attachments and clingings that actively are distracting me from becoming closer to God.

Friend in need.,Catholicism,"Hello, First time posting here or in anything on Reddit, so greetings. I know this forum and r/Christianity can get flooded with posts asking for prayers, but I feel compelled to add another. A friend and coworker of mine is a recent college grad and is living at home. Her parents are amidst a period in their marriage where every conversation is a fight and every fight is a shouting match. It has wreaked havoc on my friend’s mental state as obvious as that statement is, and a few times the parents have turned their anger towards each other on to her. Tonight has been one of those instances. The instability in the house is ruining her. I could divulge further details of the marriage but for the two people in question I will leave their personal matters private. I would ask any who see this to keep this woman, call her Jewel for the sake of anonymity, though God will know her of course. Thank you to any and all who even take a moment to look at this post.

He asked if there was anything he could do to help, but the director said no. So the priest jokingly began a prayer over the organ, intoning as he made the sign of the cross, and the organ suddenly lit up like it had been working all along!

I feel discouraged,Catholicism,"Honestly I feel like I haven't been myself lately and neither has anything. Maybe I'm experiencing a slight seasonal depression (but not really a depression, just a mood lowering). I don't know what's going on with me. There's pessimism, fake humility and apathy in me. &#x200B; I've tried doing the whole consecration to Mary thing using St Louis's method and I think it might've weirdly made me somehow worse in some aspects. The whole part about self-knowledge essentially turned me into a pessimist about everything, I am weirdly more irritable whenever somebody insults or offends me in some way, and I feel more shy and more insecure. Also... the whole process has made me ironically feel distant to Mary in some aspects. I had a strange moment of envy towards her and I now associate her with unpleasant things. I also don't understand the whole focus on hierarchy. Also I'm getting scrupulous for some reason and I don't know how to stop it. &#x200B; Our family's moved to a new place and initially it was so amazing. I was making friends and I felt like I emanated enough joy to make people around me happy, share some love and maybe even interest them in my faith. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore. &#x200B; Also I feel needy, like I'm constantly asking God for help and consolation and like that's a bad thing because a lot of saints seem to have said that it is a bad thing. A year's already passed since I started walking along this road (so to say) and I still feel very much like a damsel in distress and not like some selfless heroic lover. It matters to me that God loves me and the tenderness of it all matters to me and I can't say that I'm convinced that I'd do anything or love at all if it weren't for that. &#x200B; I had a thought one night. I thought I heard a sound downstairs and I thought 'Somebody's in the house' and then I went to 'He is coming to kill us' (me and Mom). I knew it was stupid eventually and eventually I realized it was just the wind or something but I still thought 'ok if somebody really were coming where would I hide?' For some reason my mind played out this fantasy where a guy sadistically killed my mother whilst I was under the bed and could hear the whole thing and see blood dripping and guts and he was searching for me and taunting for me as he was doing it and all. Yeah... I know I give myself nightmares. In this fantasy that was getting semi-realistic in my mind it ended with me running from the house early in the morning when the sun was not out/ barely out and reaching a place and person to console me and take care of me after that event. In this made up scenario I was saying 'Why would anybody do this?' and 'That such a terrible thing to do.... I don't think I'll ever forget or forgive that. It's horrible, totally horrible to do that to my Mom.' and then I literally had a Nathan and David moment. 'Wait a moment.... didn't I do that? Isn't this whole torture thing that I imagined probably not same if not less bad than crucifixion...' Obviously that was terrifying and it made me wonder; what does forgiveness even mean? Sure God may forgive me and not punish me with Hell for my sins and whatnot but it's still terrible. To complicate the matter there's the concept of perfect contrition. If contrition were perfect then why would Confession (or anything ever for that matter) avail anything? The deed's done and there's no way to undo it. &#x200B; On another note there are certain Catholic phrases that are often used that are (in my opinion) used in very strange ways sometimes. Such phrases include 'act of the will' and 'consent to'. I don't understand how you can divorce the will from sentiment to the extent that you can declare that contrition is an act of the will. We'd all agree that it isn't saying 'I'm sorry mostly because I love God' because you can say that and not mean it. So where is the will? You can't will to be sorry for a particular motive (no matter how you define sorry) because there comes the question 'why do you want to want to be sorry for this reason' and that will reveal the real reason for your sorrow. &#x200B; I don't know. Honestly I feel pretty weak and drained and I thought I'd post to maybe get some advice and prayers and whatnot. &#x200B; Have a blessed and fruitful Advent yall. >3 :) &#x200B; &#x200B;",a3eijo,self.Catholicism,,True

[Free Friday] What really happened with the adulterous woman,Catholicism,"The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman along who had been caught committing adultery; and making her stand there in the middle. They said to Jesus, 'Master, this woman was caught committing adultery. According to the Law of Moses, we have to stone her. What do you have to say?' &#x200B; Jesus knew they were trying to trick Him so He said, 'Let the one among you who is without sin cast the first stone.' &#x200B; When they heard this, they started to walk away but then a stone flew and hit the woman. Jesus immediately looked up and said, 'Mom, I didn't mean you!' &#x200B; Some of the people in the crowd began to pick up rocks but none cast a single one for they were confused at what was going on. Then, a rock from the sky hit the woman. Jesus looked up and said, 'Dad, knock it off!' &#x200B; :P",a68vzi,self.Catholicism,,True

The problem with some Memorial Acclamations,Catholicism,"The Memorial Acclamation, stated after the Eucharist is supposed to state three things: * Christ has died. * Christ is risen. * Christ will come again.

In other words, the kerygmatic statement is most basic and essential statement one can say about the faith. Yet, two of the three memorial acclamations skip one of the three elements at the heart of our faith. This one: ' When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup, we proclaim your Death, O Lord, until you come again,' neglects to mention the Resurrection. This one: ' Save us, Saviour of the world, for by your Cross and Resurrection you have set us free,' neglects to mention that Christ will come again.

Questions about how to confess something,Catholicism,"I've been away for a bit. I have some weird sins and I am not sure how to count them. To be vague, but also get the point across, I fell into a habit of thinking impure thoughts/fantasizing almost every day, for the past several weeks. I recognize now that this is a type of escapism and is most definitely disordered. I'm working on stopping it completely by trying to 'slam the door' on these thoughts and pray to help refocus. But, how do I confess the number of times I have violated the 6th and 9th commandments? I have trouble quantifying thoughts. I will escape into my mind multiple times of day, as I said, for the past several weeks. Do I try to count each day as one instance? Do I guess at how often each day on average I have done this and then multiply by the approximate number of days? Can I just say something like, 'over 100 times'? &#x200B; Also, the soonest I can go to confession is in 3 days. What should I do in the meantime in case I die? I really, really don't want to go to hell. (But I am also working on feeling sorry for my sins just because they offend God). &#x200B; I am really scared this time, and I am not sure why.

Retroactive Jealousy- OCD- Advice?,Catholicism,"Okay, so not so unique of a situation I am in, but I hope that some of you can help me get through this... I have been beyond jealous of my fiance's sexual past. I wont go into details, but her past is extensive enough to cause some real distraught in my life. We have been dating for over three years, and it just came on recently out of no where. I say OCD, not becasue I want to diagnose myself, but becasue these thoughts of mine are ABSOLUTELY compulsive. They pop in my head randomly, frequently and absolutely change my deminer. I wake up in the middle of the night almost every night with these destructive thoughts. I go throughout the whole day just steaming over these thoughts, and then I bring it home and treat her poorly becasue of the torment I went through all day. Well, its turned more than just thoughts now... Im finding myself doing things that 'get even' with her past. This isnt how it is supposed to be, and I absolutely know this. She is faithful, 100%, and loves me more than anyone ever has. Im lucky to have her, but even with me realizing this, I still cannot kick these thoughts. I am fantasizing about other women, not becasue I actually want to be with anyone else, but becasue i feel that I have to get even. I am afraid that one day I will go too far and ruin what I have with her, and this scares me. &#x200B; Full disclosure, my past is worse than her's. and this is the other thing that i cant understand. Why cant i get over her past when it dosent even come close to how terrible of a person I was. Its like Im mad at her, but realize Im not justified in this anger, which just adds to the confusion. The biggest weakness I have as a person is anger issues. and this jealousy is just playing right into the dark side of me. I mean its like the perfect combination, becasue they play so well into each other. &#x200B; Lastly, and this may be hokee.. but I have done a little resurch in OCD being brought on by demons that just want to torment. In my case, 3 whole years later of bliss with my love, I cant stop getting tormented. Could this be brought on by a demon that knows my weakness? I dont mean I think im possessed, but am I being played with, becasue sadly its working. &#x200B; Keep in mind, telling a person with clinical depression to 'just be happy,' is useless. Like depression, no amount of reason can pull me out of this rut. I have reasoned my way through it sooo many times, and it dosent work. if you have struggled with this, or have any advice I would absolutely love to hear from you. Know that I do absolutely love my fiance with all of my heart, and all I want is to stop being tormented by these thoughts so we can get on with our life together. How can I beat this? &#x200B; God bless...",a3rf34,self.Catholicism,,True

"Went to a parish church - update, just to be fair",Catholicism,"So... after I was pretty disappointed with my parish church yesterday, as you can read in the post history, I had originally planned to do the public transport trip to the TLM. But then, today, I still felt that dragging the kids through the worst train stations of the city at night wasn't really something I like to do, so I checked out some other churches in the area. Well, most of them held their masses in the morning, only one church (that I know to be solid, with perpetual adoration and everything) started at 6:30pm, what is a bit too late with kids in tow. But lo and behold, I found a parish offering a Polish mass at 5pm! And it was not too far away! I thought to myself, Polish Catholics around here are always pretty strong in their faith, can't hurt to check it out. Although the church itself is a , I already felt at peace when approaching it - and upon entering, I saw that it was *packed* with people, also loads and loads of families and kids! I placed the kids in the chapel/narthex, where also a lot of moms brought their squirming toddlers during mass, and watched and listened. Needless to say, I did not understand one single word. But everyone passing by gave us a friendly nod, without being pushey like those NO communities tend to be when they spot families. And when communion approached, I was delighted to see that the whole congregation was gathering around the sanctuary, kneeling on the step, and the priest actually went around and distributed the communion on the tongue! When it was our turn, the priest blessed the kids, saying a lot of words, and then turned to me with the host in his hands, continuing his words. I just blinked at him with a sheepish smile, until he asked 'You don't speak Polish?' I shook my head and he just gave me the communion with the german wording. On my way back, trying to herd the kids across the church despite the tons of other kids in the pew being much more interesting for them, I just burst into tears because the whole community was so big, nice and reverent. So... I take back what I said. Some NO masses are really nice. ",a4ow60,self.Catholicism,,True
"Today I did the right thing, but I'm afraid that it might have put me at risk.",Catholicism,"So today i was taking an exam. Before the exam, the proctor told us to put our bags out of arms reach and 'basically up agaisnt against the wall.' It didn't register with me because an hour before he showed up i had tossed my bag underneath a seat that was out of arms reach for me, and it was empty and I didn't plan on cheating anyway. Then he gave instructions about how he would inspect us before we left to make sure we didn't take anything out of the test room that we didnt bring in. So about halfway in i realized that, even though I wasn't cheating, if he saw that I didnt grab my bag from the wall that it might give the appearance of cheating. So i went out of the room, found the proctor, and explained that I made a mistake and that I hadnt cheated. So he took my name and told me to go back and finish the test, which i did. Anyway, now I'm nervous that i might get reported over this mistake, even though I know i didnt cheat and went out of my way to even avoid the appearance of cheating. This has me sort of frazzled, because ever since I came back to the church and have tried to do the right thing, I've never been at risk for being in trouble.

Mortal sin to miss mass one week?,Catholicism,I was away from the church for a while and recently came back. I’ve been doing great about making sure a make it to mass. This whole last week I have been running on exhaustion. Yesterday I uncharacteristically slept until 11. Today it was only 9 but I was struggling to get out of bed and showered to leave for mass by 9:20. When I went and told my family I was going to a later mass mom said if I waited until the evening she would go. Evening mass is at 5. About 3 we decided to run to the store. Got stuck in traffic. I was planning on going straight from the store to mass but we lost track of time and we were in line to check our a few minutes after 5. I came home and had to leave to baby sit at 7.

Questions on Mary: pt 1 of 739,Catholicism,"Hi y’all. Grew up Baptist. Currently going thru RCIA. After doing some research online into Mariology, I decided to read Glories of Mary by St Liguori. One of the quotes that surprised me was “And for the same reason it may be said, that if she brought forth Jesus Christ, the head of the Church, without pain, she did not bring forth the body of this head without pain. Hence she commenced in Calgary to be, in a particular manner, mother of the whole Church.” (Pg 14). I don’t have any issues with Mary as the Mother of the Church. But it seems... nonsensical/unimportant/needlessly miraculous to claim that Mary did not experience labor at birth. In fact, that even undercuts the symbolism of her as the 2nd Eve, since Eve experienced painful childbirth.

Christianity is a Sacrificial Religion,Catholicism,"Throughout human history, humans have been obsessed with sacrifice.

'Christ died for your sins' is basically a universal understanding for anyone of the Christian faith. THAT right there is a sacrifice!!! You literally just offered up an innocent man to be slaughtered in atonement for your sins! You're basically the Aztec priest with a knife in his hand standing over a corpse! .......and if you ever want to fully understand Christianity, you need to ask WHY that sacrifice was necessary. Some might say generic things like 'It was necessary because he was sinless and im not'. But that doesnt explain a thing! An innocent man, from the Middle East, 2000 years ago, from a culture I dont relate to at all had to die because I curse occasionally? To the non Christian it has to be incredibly confusing.

In this light, I see no conflict with protein, as it's simply a energy source that's naturally derived from milk or soy which could be ingested anyway. However, creatine, beta alanine and other similar supplements I think are more questionable. In one way, they increase physical performance and this allow us to maximize our bodies' potential. On the other hand, they could be seen as an unnatural and unnecessary means of improvement leading to vanity. What are your thoughts on this?",a8ycf5,self.Catholicism,,True
"Loved ones going the wrong way, what to do?",Catholicism,"Even though my parents and my whole family is catholic, nowadays I believe that I really wasn't properly cathecized or raised in a way that would've steered me and my sisters in the right direction more strongly. I ended up falling away from the church and it took me 9 years to find my way back. My youngest sister is still mostly ok. But my middle sister has completely fallen off the wagon. Doesn't believe in marriage, is super feminist (talking 2018 sex positive, slut worshiping, ally of everything, the complete sjw package here. Not talking about women having the right to vote). Anyway, in my atheist years I've made some major mistakes as well, I'm not denying that. But she's really really gone in a very wrong direction and my heart js breaking so so much for her. At seeing how she dresses, knowing how many sexual partners she's had, and she's only 23. It's like she's in a race or something. Today she said she doesn't plan on ever getting married. Which obviously shouldn't have come as a shock, as she's looking for the completely wrong things in men and therefore has only had disappointments. I'm so afraid for her. I don't know what to do other than pray. She's the type of person that if I confront her too openly she'll be *super* pissed at me for a long time, and even if I give my way more conservative than hers opinion too openly, I can see she gets majorly disappointed and/or pissed about it. So I really feel like my hands are tied. We really aren't the friends we used to be back when I myself was a super feminist who also treated myself casually. A while ago she even posted a picture of herself naked on instagram (doing some gymnastics so that you couldn't really see it all) and at that point I almost decided that worrying for her wasn't worth the heart ache. Tonight, that our parents are travelling, she went off to spend the night with some random guy. Now my youngest sister, who thankfully hasn't made all those mistakes yet, is in college and is stopping to attend mass, i see her less and less agreeing with me and more with middle sister. So I'm getting ready for the roll of dice that that will be as well. So I'm asking for your prayers as well as your advice. As I cannot think of anything else to do at the moment.

What if Mary said no?,Catholicism,"I just finished reading the Annunciation to Mary section in Jesus of Nazareth The Infancy Narratives by Pope Benedict XVI and I came across this passage. 'In one of his Advent homilies, Bernard of Clairvaux offers a stirring presentation of the drama of this moment. After the error of our first parents, the whole world was shrouded in darkness, under the dominion of death. Now God seeks to enter the world anew. He knocks at Mary's door. He needs human freedom. The only way he can redeem man, who was created free, is by means of a free 'yes' to his will. In creating freedom, he made himself in a certain sense dependent upon man. His power is tied to the unenforceable 'yes' of a human being. So Bernard portrays heaven and earth as it were holding its breath at this moment of the question addressed to Mary. Will she say yes? She hesitates...will her humility hold her back? Just this once-Bernard tells her-do not be humble but daring! Give us your 'yes'! This is the crucial moment when from lips, from her heart, the answer comes: 'Let it be to me according to your word.' It is the moment of free, humble yet magnanimous obedience in which the loftiest choice of human freedom is made.' It left me wondering, what if Mary said no? Would we even know who Mary was? Would God have asked someone else to be the Mother of God? What if God sent an angel to another woman before Mary asking her to be the Mother of God, and she refused? Would mankind have been saved by God in another way? Or was it always going to be Mary from the start, and God knew she was going to say yes? ",a6c605,self.Catholicism,,True
Blessing of a new wedding ring?,Catholicism,I lost my wedding ring today. I’ve lost a lot of weight recently and my ring has gotten looser to the point where it has fallen off a few times.

From my favorite Office of Readings reading - by Saint Bernard,Catholicism,"“Tearful Adam with his sorrowing family begs this of you, O loving Virgin, in their exile from Paradise. Abraham begs it, David begs it. All the other holy patriarchs, your ancestors, ask it of you, as they dwell in the country of the shadow of death. This is what the whole earth waits for, prostrate at your feet. It is right in doing so, for on your word depends comfort for the wretched, ransom for the captive, freedom for the condemned, indeed, salvation for all the sons of Adam, the whole of your race.” Today’s daily Mass gospel reading is the Annunciation. I find it helpful, encouraged by Saint Bernard’s text, to place myself at the scene, waiting for Mary’s response. She was, after all, free. Freer, in fact than I have ever been - her mind, after all, was never clouded by sin - no ambition, no envy, no indifference. Being free, she could have said “No.” So stand and watch, with all of the other sorrowing sons of Adam and daughters of Eve. Watch with all of creation. Hold your breath - wait and hope. Beg her to speak the word and conceive the Word that will set us free. ",a7y4u3,self.Catholicism,,True

Parents stopped going to church...not sure what to say to help them.,Catholicism,"Disclosure: I am not a Catholic myself anymore, this is a separate issue but I wanted to make my bias out there first of all. My parents are Catholic, and the vast majority of my family is Catholic. Over the past year or so a variety of ongoing issues in their church have alienated my parents from continuing to attend Catholic services (financial scandals, child abuse, lies by clergy). To put things really bluntly, these are issues that have existed for Catholic churches for a very long time, but they have intensified locally recently and apparently the magnitude of the problem has finally hit home for them because it's personally affecting them in their own church as opposed to Catholics elsewhere. My father is a Catholic through and through but he is just stopped going to church altogether... He has giving a lot of money over the years and is unsure how to deal with his own criticisms of the church. He refuses to attend a different Church, he said it just doesn't feel right. My mother feels like she has to go to church, even if not Catholic, and has begun attending Methodist services with her sister (who was thrown out of the Catholic church decades ago) instead of going to Catholic mass. Neither of them are very happy right now, my father does not like being separated from the church and my mother is not happy trying to go to the Methodist route. This said their self-imposed exile from church is their own decision. I am not exactly the person to help them heal their emotional divide with the Catholic community/church. My siblings are no help either despite remaining theists in principle. I know that it is logically bankrupt to stop going to Catholic Church just because you have a problem with the humans who are currently running it, but this problem has boiled down to being a financial and emotional one for them as opposed to being a theological or reason based one for them. Personally I don't know why they think that it makes sense to potentially endanger their own salvation just because some clergy have done things that they have a personal problem with. I make this post just to ask this community what their opinion is on the situation. To me it feels like they are desperate to have a reason to return to the church but they've now developed the nagging doubt of whether or not they want to be socially and financially associated with the Catholic Church. personally I'm not worried about their damnation because I am not a Christian anymore but whenever they are upset and struggling emotionally I feel like I should take an interest and be supportive in whatever way I can. So if any of you have a recommendation on what I can share with them to help them in their journey returning to the church, please just let me know.

Possible theodicy,Catholicism,"Please tell me if this is heretical. I have been going through a long period of being spiritual disquieted. I was trying to come up with a solution to the Problem of Evil in order to satisfy myself and this is what I thought up. If it has any holes in it, let me know. I want to perfect this as much as I can. When God was creating the universe, He couldn't make a perfect universe that had agents with free will in it. In order to have agents with free will, a universe had to have flaws at first (which God will fix; cf. Revelation chapter 22). Therefore He made the best possible universe that was able to contain free agents. So, yes, I limit God, **but** I only do it by saying 1. the only thing He can't do is contradict His own nature 2. logic flows from the very nature of God 3. therefore God is bound by logic 4. but at the same time logic does not arise from anyplace above God. God is still the highest-in-command (nothing exists above Him), but has His limits which arise from Himself. He can't make a circle with 3 sides or a triangle without no sides. Nor can He make a rock so big He cannot lift it, make today be tomorrow, or evaluate the truthfulness of the color orange. In the same way, He cannot make a universe with free-acting agents and no evil (including natural evil).",a3wx21,self.Catholicism,,True
Gossip and Detraction Sins in Marriage ?,Catholicism,"One of my Most Frequently Sinned items is gossip or detraction. I think I’m inclined to this sin because it’s an ego boost to some degree. I’m also a pretty observant and thinking-oriented person, so it’s not necessarily that I’m wrong, Walter, I’m just ___. You know. However, I’m struggling with some particular aspects of “what is gossip and detraction” that I could use some help on. More specifically, I’m not sure if telling these things to my husband (who comprises 95% of my adult social conversation day to day) is gossip or not. It puts me in a position where I feel skeevy *consciously* “not telling my husband things.” Here’s the most common set of situations I find myself in: (1) Complaining about how Susie Q at work really communicated so poorly her needs that I had to engage in a three times back and forth email to clarify what she needed. I’ve *mostly* eliminated this one. This appears to be purely making myself feel superior, and adds no to negative value in sharing with my husband. It’s just complaining. (2) Talking about the current scandals in the Church, recent allegations in our diocese or nearby (including specifics from first hand accounts). I keep up with church news more closely than does my husband. I’m struggling with this one. Is it gossip or detraction if I’m discussing active legal investigations with him that are documented in periodicals? I’ve bit my tongue twice now in the past week on two different topics on this matter. (3) Recently, I told him about a particularly salacious part of a national news story I had been following. Yes, I probably shouldn’t have been reading it... I told him because I was aghast at the approach this person took to life and to this situation. Still, afterward I felt terrible about it and decided not to take Holy Communion because I had very much debated as to whether or not I should tell him (whether it would be gossip or not) and decided to tell him anyway. That felt like a mortal sin to me. I should point out that my husband very, very likely wouldn’t care if I shared these items with him or not. He would probably consider them low-level information. However, it bugs me a lot to actively “keep things” from him. Maybe I’m looking for an excuse to gossip, though; I’m not sure. I’ve asked his opinion on the matter in the past and he’s been of the “shrug, if you feel like telling me, tell me” or “if you think I should know, tell me.” He doesn’t spend nearly as much time as I do agonizing over things like this. I’m not fully assuaged yet. I would appreciate some feedback on how I can handle these situations better and what a proper disposition should be to sharing low level information like this in marriage.

What Exactly is Homosexuality?,Catholicism,"My understanding is the following: homosexuality refers to a specific form of sexual relation between persons (man and man, or woman and woman); homosexual acts are acts essential to this sexual relationship; and 'homosexual' is not an identity, but a descriptor of one's sexual orientation. Is this wrong? Could someone elaborate on it for me? For context: I go to a school where Foucault is kind of a big deal. I tried explaining to my friends that Catholicism did not really have a concept of homosexuality in the way that Foucault, *et al.*, would have. Thus, we generally use language such as 'SSA' (same-sex attracted). But this seems to contradict *CCC* 2359 ('Homosexual persons...), so I'm now confused as to what it is we believe. Tying personal identity to sexual orientation seems dangerous, because it appears to construct our identity on a bundle of preferences (rather than on shared human nature and distinct accidents of the human person - which is how I understand identity; but, again, I can be wrong).

Originally posted in r/Christianity and was redirected to posting this here. I was wondering where I could purchase a rosary and how do I go about getting it blessed?,Catholicism,"Hello all, longtime lurker but first time poster here. I (22F) have found my way back to Christ after losing my way and denying him for about 10 years. A little background about myself-born and raised in a Catholic household, I was baptized as young as a baby could be, I remember going to mass every Sunday, went through CCD and made my communion and had been confirmed. There were many things that led to me drifting away from the path that the lord and my parents had wanted for me, but I don't want to go too in depth as this isn't meant to be a testimonial post. The last few months I have been trying to do some deep self reflection, repent for my sins and for denying God for so long, and reading the bible again before bedtime. I haven't been in a church since I was 12 years old and the thought of going back after it being so long, seems to frighten me. I have this weird paranoia that other faithful church goers can like, smell a sinner from a mile away. I've been watching mass on television at the moment to feel apart of a church and in participating in that, I stumbled upon this segment on the same channel called 'Rosary: The Joyful Mysteries' and it's a half hour dedication to praying on the rosary. I was really intrigued in this as I remember praying on a rosary in Sunday school but never went too far into it, just what we *had* to do. I found another video on YouTube about the power of praying the whole rosary every single day and I felt really inspired to start trying. I do not own a rosary and am wondering, where can I get one and how can I get mine blessed? Thank you all in advance!",a4liyi,self.Catholicism,,True

On Apokatastasis (Universal Reconciliation) and the Eternal Present.,Catholicism,"Apokatastasis/Universal Reconciliation, the belief that all souls will be reunited with God in heaven, (Look it up before you call me a heretic) is an \*unconventional\* yet \*non-heretical\* belief (as God wants communion with all souls and God gets what He wants). To any theology scholars out there, the belief seems to be at odds with certain conceptions of the afterlife that have been explained to me. Essentially, I have read and have had explained to me that time does not exist in the afterlife, this is the case in both heaven and hell, they are eternally present states of being. In other words, There is no change of state that can occur \*after\* death, as change can only happen within the passage time. You exist in a single moment for eternity with or without God. With this logic, If you go to hell, you will be there, in pain of your own making, eternally. Vice-Versa with heaven. So is it that: 1. The belief of Universal Reconciliation is claptrap? 2. The idea of the eternal present is claptrap? 3. God pulls a fast one and does something like forgive us all the moment before we die? I find that all three possibilities are somewhat unacceptable answers. I have sympathy for both the belief of UR and the idea of the eternal present, but think that sinners need to feel the wages of sin, or else they did not have free will in the first place.",a4rmn6,self.Catholicism,,True

Wow my brother said he will wear the St Benedict medal I gave him for Christmas!,Catholicism,"Honestly I can't believe it he *never* wears any jewellery or anything remotely like that and as he is a lapsed Catholic I thought he would throw it back at me laughing. He was *delighted* with it and put it straight on. Slight back-story to anyone that didn't see a post a while ago on my brother. He's got real psychological problems since his wife killed herself in 2012. He has tried to kill himself multiple times including driving 300 miles the other night to kill himself on Dartmoor. He nearly succeeded by accident when he fell into a river and got hypothermia but luckily the rescue services found him in time. That was a few days ago. I have been praying for him for ages and this was a last hope as he shuns religion. I picked up 10 St Benedict medals at the shop after my TLM a few Sundays ago. I took them to the priest who performed the Old Rite blessing in Latin with all the exorcism and holy water that it takes. It was my idea this Christmas to give these out as gifts to my nephews as I'm there Godparent as well as my other family members. I was hoping my brother would accept it and the timing was perfect. He sat down and jokingly asked, 'Well what have you got me for Christmas then?' this was a joke as he hates it. I took the medal from around my neck and said, 'This!' and he was gobsmacked haha amazing. I know there are a lot of important posts and apologise for taking up another post I'm just *delighted!* I really hope this helps him come back to the faith one day. I feel much better he has this medal on him. He does still have some faith and was really interested in the exorcism it contains on its face. God bless you all :)",a96qmk,self.Catholicism,,True
Possibly complicated question about the morality of streaming. Am I being a moral relativist?,Catholicism,"I had been streaming episodes of an anime that is airing every week, but I started questioning my moral standing in doing so. Please help me untangle the morality here. I feel very confused. Here is my thought process: Japan is notorious for being terrible at opening up business to the rest of the world. The only place the anime is available is with a subscription to Crunchyroll, but Crunchyroll isn't exactly a company I want to support... I know anime is a controversial topic for a lot of people here. I will be the first to say there is a ton of immoral garbage in the anime industry, but it is wrong to say there is not also beautiful art created through anime. I want to support the creation of that art, but it's complicated because companies like crunchyroll do not keep that art's best interest in mind. I was talking to my friend about this yesterday and he made the point that animation studios won't ever question their ways unless they see the audiences they are losing to streaming. I think that line of thinking is bad because it's arguing the ends justify the means, but then he also said that he still puts in effort to give money to the creators when he can. Like for example, Studio Trigger has a patreon set up, and he donated money to them. Is it morally permissible to sort of skip the 'middle man' that is crunchyroll and give money directly to the creators in that way? Is this a valid way to think or am I just making excuses? Would it be wrong of me to subscribe to crunchyroll even if I think they are not deserving of my money? Thank you for listening. I know I am not unbiased here, and that is why I would really like opinions/advice from people who don't have my biases (in that I would prefer to not give up anime, if possible). Please pray for me that I can see clearly, and always put Jesus before my desires.",a756e6,self.Catholicism,,True

Has anyone ever had any kind of mystical experience?,Catholicism,"Up to this point in my life I have only told maybe three people of this because I know it sounds crazy and no one will believe me, but sometimes when I take the Eucharist I can actually feel God in my soul. In my soul I feel a personality actually moving in my soul. It's like a happy, playful puppy dog moving around, while also like being soothing like aloe vera on a sunburn, and like bumper bars in a bowling alley in that it makes it strengthens my will so that it is much harder to actually drift off into sinning. It's really hard to explain without having gone through it and I don't know if this is a regular thing that happens to everyone else. It's happened too many times, and I'm quite a skeptical but fully believing Catholic (and certainly not the most devout Catholic) so I've asked myself so many times when it happens to me if I'm delusional, but it's just happened so many times and I've picked it apart in so many ways - and I'm a very rational person who doesn't actually want it to happen - I just can't deny that it happens.

How do I know God wants me to be a priest?,Catholicism,"I just googled 'Should I become a priest?' (heh) and found this . To my bewilderment, it speaks really deeply to me. I'm currently 25 and the first time this thought came to my mind was around ten years ago or so, but it wasn't serious of course. I became a lapsed Catholic until I found my way back to the the faith a couple of months\* ago. I always believed in God and the Church, I just didn't go to Mass and didn't bother to learn the Church's teachings, because I was too... I don't know... too lazy? I wanted to try out the 'benefits' of a secular life but I also always knew that it's wrong and that some day, I would come back to the Church. Well, I did, and now my faith is stronger than ever before - and I feel really ashamed for many of the things I did. The thing is, I don't know whether my thoughts of becoming a priest are just the typical enthusiam of someone who has recently found his faith or whether they're to be taken seriously. On the one hand, I want to marry and start a family - on the other hand, I've been thinking of becoming a priest every single day recently. Also, if I'm really honest, I don't think I'm made for marriage. Sure, the thought is nice and all, but when I try to imagine what it would actually, really be like, I don't find it that attractive anymore. More and more, it seems to me, that by living an ordinary (don't be mad at me, Chesterton! ;)) life, doing an ordinary job and marrying would not be what I truly want but rather a concession (I hope this is the right word, I'm not a native English speaker) towards society's and my family's expectations. Currently, I'm studying math and until recently, my goal has been to become a math teacher. I enjoy math, I really do, but to be honest, it didn't feel like the right path from the beginning. It doesn't feel important enough to me. Not a single job I did or thought of doing did. The thought of becoming a priest is the first thing that has made me think: 'Yep! This is it! This is what I'm made to be!' On a surface level, I don't want to become a priest, because I still would like to marry and start a family, but deep down, it feels like the right thing to do. I know, this sounds like I'm already sure of it. But what if, as I said, am just in my enthusiastic beginner phase? What if I romanticise priesthood and would be a really bad priest actually? I mean I'm not even an eloquent person, but as a priest, I would have to give homilies. I can't read notes but as a priest, I would have to sing. I can't even sing! Also, I don't speak Latin (although this is probably the smallest problem, because I like learning languages and I've been interested in learning Latin for a long time). &#x200B; I'm really sorry for this long and confused post, but it has been on my mind for weeks. Answers from actual priests would be welcome. &#x200B; \*I know, a few months are anything but a long time, but on the other hand, I keep thinking of Bishop Barron speaking in his book 'Catholicism' (which had a great influence on me) of how Jesus totally unexpectedly invaded Peter's boat basically out of nowhere and made him into his apostle.

However, few churches are listing distinct mass times for Saturday even though it’s a day of obligation. I’m hoping any Chicago based Catholics can recommend a mass for me! I’d like a mass after like 6.30pm and prefer the church either to have either an organ / trad-Cat view of music, or no music at all. I usually go to St John Cantius or Pius V, but St John Cantous’s mass is at 5 and Pius V doesn’t say on their site. Any recommendations for a late evening mass for Saturday in Chicago?

Put on your own Mask Before Assisting Others,Catholicism,"Some months ago I connected this phrase with my prayer life. I used to try to put all my prayers for others first. If something got skipped it was my prayer for myself, or for my own intentions. I was honestly trying to be a good, generous, Charitable Christian. At the same time I was wallowing a bit - oh I don't matter so much and my requests and wants don't matter. There was a fundamental misunderstanding of misuse of prayer in there. It does so much more for one's soul and strength and spiritual health. I was tired, and started to realise this, and realise that I was getting weaker in my. spiritual life. I realised that I couldn't pray for others with quality of I wasn't strong enough. If I wanted to empty myself out I had to be seeking out the Holy Spirit to fill me up. So, to men especially, pray for yourself. Just like you should put on your own oxygen mask before assisting someone else with theirs, you have to pray for yourself before you pray for others. pray for yourself!

Argument from Jesus' Miracles -- What do you think?,Catholicism,"**Introduction** When we think of historical evidence for the truth of Christianity to show to skeptics, Jesus’ miracles don’t normally come to mind. We think that skeptics will brush off Jesus’ miracles because they do not trust the traditions in the bible, and we move on to other arguments, like the historical case of the resurrection, Catholic miracles or the religious experiences and mystical gifts of our saints. In fact, many of us might even agree with skeptics that Jesus’ miracles cannot be confidently and credibly put forward as evidence. But what if we can? Many people may not know this but Jesus performing miracles is something that virtually all scholars today recognize, including skeptical scholars. Of course whether these miracles are genuine, the result of magic, fraud or some other explanation is another matter. The important thing is almost all scholars recognize that Jesus performed miracles, and that he was widely known by people during his time as a healer and exorcist. Personally, I believe we can strengthen the historical case for Christianity and build a good case around the fact that Jesus performed miracles. I actually came up with an argument of my own (inspired by Lewis’ trilemma) which I will share with you guys below. **Critiques and suggestions are greatly welcome.** Anyway to begin my case I’ll start by listing a number of quotes to substantiate the claim that virtually all scholars today believe that Jesus’ performed miracles. I’ll start by quoting the preeminent scholar today on the historical Jesus, John Meier, who did a thorough 200 page historical study of Jesus’ miracles in volume 2 of his Marginal Jew series. I will then quote Graham Twelfree, who is arguably the leading authority on the miracles and exorcisms of Jesus. After quoting Meier and Twelfree, I will quote a number of known agnostic, atheist and liberal scholars (Ehrman, Crossan, Vermes, Sanders, Fredriksen and Borg), showing their recognition of the historicity of Jesus’ miracles. Then I will end by listing a few quotes by Twelfree, Keener and Evans to further support the widespread acceptance of Jesus’ miracles as historical fact by scholars. &#x200B; **Historical fact: Jesus performed miracles** >'To sum up: the historical fact that Jesus performed extraordinary deeds deemed by himself and others to be miracles is supported most impressively by the criterion of multiple attestation of sources and forms and the criterion of coherence. The miracle traditions about Jesus’ public ministry are already so widely attested in various sources and literary forms by the end of the first Christian generation that total fabrication by the early church is practically speaking, impossible. Other literary sources from the second and third generation – M, L, John, and Josephus – only confirm this impression. The criterion of coherence likewise supports historicity; the neat fit between the words and deeds of Jesus emanating from many different sources is striking.' >'Viewed globally, the tradition of Jesus’ miracles is more firmly supported by the criteria of historicity than are a number of other well-known and often readily accepted traditions about his life and ministry…Put dramatically but with not too much exaggeration: if the miracle tradition from Jesus’ public ministry were to be rejected in toto as unhistorical, so should every other Gospel tradition about him.” >\- **John Meier** ('A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus Vol II.') &#x200B; >'In answer to the question ‘Did Jesus perform miracles?’ we have to reply with an unequivocal and resounding ‘Yes!’…The necessary conclusion, in the light of our inquiry, is that there is hardly any aspect of the life of the historical Jesus which is so well and widely attested as that he conducted unparalleled wonders.' - **Graham Twelftree** ('Jesus the Miracle Worker: A Historical and Theological Study') &#x200B; >'Whatever you think about the philosophical possibility of miracles of healing, it’s clear that Jesus was widely reputed to have done them.' - **Bart Ehrman** ('The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings') &#x200B; >'Jesus was both an exorcist and a healer.' **- John Dominic Crossan** (‘The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant’) &#x200B; >“Also, acts of healing and exorcism were seen as tangible confirmation of the validity and compelling character of his teaching” - **Geza Vermes** (‘The Religion of Jesus the Jew') &#x200B; >“Exorcism, however, is the most prominent type of cure in the synoptic gospels. The sheer volume of evidence makes it extremely likely that Jesus actually had a reputation as an exorcist.” >“I think we can be fairly certain that Jesus’ fame came as a result of healing, especially exorcism.” >\- **E.P Sanders** (‘The Historical Figure of Jesus.’)” &#x200B; >“\[W\]e note that Jesus as exorcist, healer (even to the point of raising the dead), and miracle worker is one of the strongest, most ubiquitous, and most variously attested depictions in the Gospels. All strata of this material–Mark, John, M-traditions, L-traditions, and Q–make this claim. This sort of independent multiple attestation supports arguments for the antiquity of a given tradition, implying that its source must lie prior to its later, manifold expressions, perhaps in the mission of Jesus himself.” >“Yes, I think that Jesus probably did perform deeds that contemporaries viewed as miracles.” >\- **Paula Fredriksen** (‘Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews’) &#x200B; >'Despite the difficulty which miracles pose for the modern mind, on historical grounds it is virtually indisputable that Jesus was a healer and exorcist.” - **Marcus Borg** (‘Jesus, A New Vision: Spirit, Culture, and The Life of Discipleship’) &#x200B; >'There is now almost unanimous agreement among Jesus questers that the historical Jesus performed mighty works.” – **Graham Twelftree** (The Face of New Testament Studies) &#x200B; >'Most historical Jesus scholars today, regardless of their personal theological orientation, do accept that Jesus drew crowds who believed that he performed cures and exorcisms.” - **Craig Keener** (The Gospels as Sources for Historical Information about Jesus) &#x200B; >“Scholarship has now moved past its preoccupation with demythologization. The miracle stories are now treated seriously and are widely accepted by Jesus scholars as deriving from Jesus’ ministry.” – **C. A. Evans** In the end, virtually all scholars today recognize that Jesus performed miracles and that he was known by people during his lifetime as a healer and exorcist. Skeptics have to confront and explain this fact. They have three options – Jesus was a liar, a lunatic or a genuine miracle worker. &#x200B; **Why Jesus was not a liar** There are a number of problems with the idea that Jesus was a liar. One, if Jesus faked being a miracle worker, then he would be a profound liar and fraud -- but this goes against what he know about Jesus as a devout Jew and great moral teacher. Jesus was a man who preached that we should love God and our neighbour, stressed the importance of forgiveness, showed great care for the poor and the sick and accepted and loved sinners. He gave striking sermons (see Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:7) and preached in parables to teach truths about heaven, loss and redemption, love and forgiveness, and prayer. When we look at Jesus' life we strongly get the impression that this is a man who genuinely believed in the value of a virtuous and religious life. It is hard to believe that such a man was, at his core, a liar and a fraud. Two, if Jesus was a liar, how did he fake his miracles? How did he fake healing people from various conditions and convince them that they had been healed of them? Although people in the ancient world were more open to the supernatural than us morderners, they too had healthy doses of skepticism. In fact, skepticism and doubt are peppered throughout the New Testament writings (Matt 8:25-27, Matt 13:53-58, Mk 5:35-42, Lk 24:9-11, Matt 28:16-17, Jn 20:24-28, 1 Gal 1:18-24, 1 Corinthians 1:22-23, Acts 17:31-32 and Acts 28:22–28). Three, if Jesus was a liar, then we would also have to say that he either fooled his disciples into thinking that he was a miracle worker, or that his disciples were complicit in the lie as well. It is hard to believe that Jesus fooled his disciples into thinking that he performed miracles because they were intimately close. The disciples were not only Jesus’ followers, they were also his friends. They talked to Jesus, ate with him and travelled with him on a regular basis. They spent considerable time together. Miracle working was a key feature of Jesus' ministry, faking them all would entail large scale fraud. If Jesus faked his miracles, it is highly likely that many of his disciples would have noticed. On the other hand, the idea that Jesus’ disciples were complicit in his lie is also problematic. If Jesus' followers realized that he was a fraud and faked his miracles, they would leave him. They would lose respect for and trust in Jesus. This is especially true if his disciples followed him because they thought he was the Messiah, Israel's long awaited Savior. In any case, the disciple's conscience would go against aligning themselves with a fraudulent ministry that dupes so many people and is an affront to God. The only way Jesus' followers would be willing to stay with him despite knowing that he was a fraud was if they had something to gain from Jesus' lie. But it is hard to see what they could possibly gain from playing along with his lie. Being a follower of Jesus was not convenient or materially rewarding. With Jesus, they all lived simple lives. In fact, a life of austerity was a requirement if one were to follow Jesus. Jesus lived that way, and he expected his disciples to live as he did. **Why Jesus was not a lunatic** If Jesus was a lunatic, to the degree that he had delusions about being capable of performing miracles, then his attempts to perform miracles would not fool anyone. People are not fooled by lunatics but by cunning liars who attempt and know how to deceive. Moreover, the idea that Jesus is a lunatic goes against what we know of him and his life -- that he was a great moral teacher who had a successful ministry. If Jesus were a lunatic (again, to the degree that he had delusions about being capable of performing miracles), would he develop a reputation of being wise? Would he have the ability to attract large crowds in a positive way? Would he be capable of preaching in a compelling manner? Would his moral teachings (e.g. see Jesus' Sermon of the Mount and his parables) be full of wisdom and grounded in reality? Would he be capable of being an inspiring figure to others? Would he have the ability to attract a considerable group of loyal followers? Would he be a type of person his followers would look up to and admire? Likely not. Wise, inspiring, charismatic and effective (as a teacher and as a leader of his movement) are not marks of a lunatic. **Why Jesus was a genuine miracle worker** If Jesus was a genuine miracle worker, then that would explain why he was widely known by people during his lifetime as a miracle worker, particularly, as a healer and exorcist. Jesus being a genuine miracle worker also aligns with what we know about him and his life, that he was a Jew, that he was a great moral teacher who had a successful ministry, and that, as an individual, he was wise, inspiring, charismatic and effective. Jesus being a miracle worker also best explains why he garnered a considerable group of loyal followers, who stuck with him until the end of his ministry, and even continued to preach in his name after his death. Unlike the liar and lunatic theories, the genuine miracle worker theory poses no problems or difficulties. **Conclusion** In conclusion, Jesus being a genuine miracle worker is the best explanation for the evidence we have. It is also unaccompanied by the problems that beset the liar and lunatic theories. If Jesus was a genuine miracle worker, then it gives credibility to the Christian religion and strengthens its historical case.",a62h91,self.Catholicism,,True

I also thought about St. Monica, as she surely understands my struggle to be a patient mother and wife.

Lay or independent private investigation into abuse,Catholicism,"I hope this isn't against the rules (maybe political?), but I haven't seen much serious discussion on the subject. There are agencies which specialize in investigating compliance, abuse, and corruption in government, private organizations. Likewise, there are many qualified individuals who could be hired to evaluate and improve the heuristics and strategy which Bishops employ in order to catch abusers. I understand the hesitancy on an intuitive level, to invite non-Catholic scrutiny, but imagine if there was a physical disease spreading in the church. The church would not handle it internally, they would invite epidemiologist and assorted experts to combat the disease. Sexual abuse, molestation, rape have been modeled successfully as deaseases. There are risk factors, and ways to detect, mitigate, etc. Why does the Catholic community have such optimism that they can develop, in months, effective techniques to combat patterns of abuse which the private, goverment sector has been studying for decades? This is not a matter of faith, it is a matter of public health and safety. Churches, schools are institutions that handle children. They should be expected to use the most modern and objective methods to combat said matter. Perhaps I am missing something.

[Free Friday] Kids Need Dogs!,Catholicism,"I'm sure this isn't news to those of you who have always had dogs, but I didn't have dogs growing up, and it's news to me, and probably others. My mom finally convinced my dad to get a dog 10 years ago, after 30 years of marriage. We are living together again, and so I have been doing a lot of the work with her two dogs. So many of the things I would have learned from having dogs as a boy would have made me a different man in so many healthy ways, including spiritually. Especially, dogs would have prepared me for my vocation. Only after immense failure did I realize I was entirely unprepared for my vocation, and that I had no real understanding of it. I didn't have as good a model as I thought, and I did not understand what vocation is. But dogs c could well have taught me what I needed to know without my realizing. It is obvious that a boy (yes, or a girl, but I wasn't one of those) learns simple responsibility from having a dog, but there is more. He can learn to be both soft and hard, in that he will play and cuddle his pet and love him in a soft and gentle way, but at the same time he must be firm and consistent or the dog will become unruly. What more he can learn is that the unruly, undisciplined dog is *unhappy* and that the boy's loving discipline leads to the dog thriving. From this he learns about himself as a boy, and how his own obedience to the Church, to God, and to his parents will make him happier. He will learn the frustration of a dog that simply won't listen, and so understand his parents' feelings when he is not compliant, and will begin to learn to process these feelings before he faces them with his own children. The dog itself will model to a child loyalty, devotion and protectiveness. He will see in the dog a willingness to sacrifice, and to risk oneself for the sake and safety of those one loves. The dog will model empathy, and joyfulness. A dog will model unconditional love. In caring for the dog, a child has the chance to fail in caring for the dog, and to see the cost of his selfishness to his pet, whom he loves. He will experience letting the dog down. Perhaps the dog getting sick, or lost, or hurt. At a minimum, a boy experiences the risk of these things; for some that will be all it takes to internalize 'this creature relies on me and my own self discipline to keep him safe, so I must be disciplined.' Other boys will experience the unhappy consequences of undiscipline to some degree. I don't mean to sound uncompassionate toward the dog in that situation; I don't mean we should invite pain upon the dog just to teach a lesson. Prudence is important to know how much responsibility and what level of parental intervention is right at any given time. But at the right time, the success and flourishing of a child's soul that can be gained by allowing moderated failure in the care of a living creature is immense! The lifespan of a healthy dog even allows a first and second chance at all if this, over the course of childhood. Perhaps it's no coincidence that dogs live about 10 years, and people take about 20 to grow up. I love cats, for the record. Have cats. Cats are great!

Of course I, and soon she, cannot receive communion there even though everyone in the room acknowledges those particular substances are only crackers and juice and are taken in memory of Christ, as misguided as the means may be here. My fiancee regards the Church's stance in both matters as overly concerned with rules and not having any spiritual consequence. While I respect without qualm the Church's authority over both matters, I'm having a hard time answering her in a way that resonates, especially on the matter of the wedding location. On a broader level, how do you answer charges of making a big to-do over seemingly minor issues being similar to the Pharisees? On a more specific level, any advice on how I can give more clarity on these two concerns? Very much appreciated. ",a50mii,self.Catholicism,,True

How do Ordinariates work??,Catholicism,"Hello! The other day on this sub, the topic of ordinariates was brought up, specifically for former Anglicans looking to be Catholic. I honestly didn't know ordinariates existed so I did some research and from what I can tell, they are fully part of the Catholic Church and in communion with Rome, but keep aspects of the Anglican tradition that are not theologically incompatible with Roman teaching. In that sense, it seems similar to the Eastern Catholic rite to me, in the sense of unifying under the Pope but holding onto liturgical tradition. However, why Eastern Catholic churches are considered part of the diocese and ordinariates are their own thing? Why would this be the case? Are they just for converts? Also I read somewhere that those who are not converts (so, already Catholic) cannot generally be a part of ordinariates. But, if they are in full communion with Rome, I don't fully understand why (Maybe I'm just really asking the difference between an ordinariate and a rite...). ",a54m7p,self.Catholicism,,True
My total failure to come up with a New Year's resolution,Catholicism,"I like the stickied post about New Year's resolutions, and I wanted to think of one, but in my current state (it comes and goes), I literally cannot think about making one.

(Reddit being Reddit, that is not particularly going to stop me.) Feels like * the tension of not being able to breathe properly (I have mild asthma so it reminds me of when I reluctantly get out my rescue inhaler because I notice I am breathing too shallowly.) * inability to think about the future (like hitting a blank white wall or being in a thick fog) * stupid worries (if I go to public rosary after daily Mass and can't speak *and* can't even attend to the vocal prayers silently because I cannot verbalize anything in my head, 'should I say the rosary again later?', 'does Mary mind?') * feeling of not understanding anything. Picture yourself in the class you had to drop (or should have dropped), totally not getting the fast Fourier transform or whatever; then spread the feeling around more until it looks like a pink scene in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. * prayer sometimes consisting only of repeating 'I don't understand' and crying a little because 1. not-understanding is apparently painful and 2. I 'do not know' what I am 'supposed to do' and this is upsetting. * new this week: the Litany of Humility is *consoling* (this is hilarious if you ask me. Partway through it starts to be very relaxing. Maybe just because there is a lot of the name 'Jesus' in it.) I blame you u/Falandorn ;) * sometimes when praying is painful I do not know why (usually a person knows why they are sad or in some kind of inner pain. I have plenty of reasons to be upset and often enough it is one of them, but sometimes it is just totally unlabeled.) * abandonment to divine providence is all very well (or, I am ok when there is a specific task in front of me) but not knowing God's will in an unresolved situation feels like being suspended between things, or impaled (like the scarecrow in Oz when Dorothy meets him and he can't get down from the pole to go anywhere). bonus points if anyone has read Three Men in a Boat and quotes the classic prescription from it (on the grounds that I have diagnosed myself with 'everything except housemaid's knee.')",a86q5u,self.Catholicism,,True

The Three Cars,Catholicism,"There was a certain company that lent three cars to three drivers, it was a generous company and it didn't provide any firm paperwork only a promise to service the cars every time they were returned. The first car went to a good driver who pushed it quite hard, they drove it daily and unfortunately got in to a few scrapes. Most years they brought it back for a service but some years they forgot. As it got older it got less reliable until one hot summer it broke down far away from the company. The company eventually located the car and towed the car and driver back to base for a service and after everything was fixed up they only charged the driver for the recovery and kindly let them keep the car and drive it home up North State. The second car went to a driver who was quite careless, they always had a good time and soon forgot all about the company. As the car was fast when it was new they drove without a care and soon the car was quite scratched up. Indicators didn't work and even the headlights started to fail. The driver became resentful at the possible bill so instead of returning to the company they drove further and further away. Eventually they crashed the car many miles away and just abandoned it never looking back. The company located the car but the driver was long-gone. As it was in such a poor state the company had the car crushed, the driver was never seen again. The third car went to a driver who wasn't that confident. They initially crashed the car but immediately called the company who happily collected and repaired the car taking good care of the driver. They provided free lessons and fixed the car up like new each time until the driver was confident. The driver carried on returning the car yearly then monthly and as it got older even weekly to ensure it ran perfectly. Their friends were so impressed with the service even they started to approach the company for offers. One day the company invited in the driver and presented them with a brand new top of the line edition for free, thanked them for their careful ownership and let them drive home North State with this perfect car. Which driver are we? Do we run far away from God, ungrateful and embarrassed like a thief? Do we rarely think of Him and only stay close out of habit or convenience? Or do we tend well what He has given us and gladly return it to Him when He calls? God be with you :) ",a924q7,self.Catholicism,,True
Any tips on someone coming back to the church after awhile?,Catholicism,"So I went to church today with my mom and had a good time. I've been having a rough go of it with anxiety, work, and just life in general. I had a really bad day on Friday that I'm not going to get into right now but it kind of led me to want to go back to the church. I know a lot of people tend to turn to the church when they feel they have not many options... I guess that makes me one of those people. However, it's been on my mind for a while now. I'm an agnostic but I lean towards believing in something greater. I love science but there are a lot of things in my life that while some might call just chance or the luck of the draw I feel like they might be something more. Like fate. So I'm giving it another try. I'm 24 now. After I received communion (is that the right word? when you first get to eat the body of Christ?) I felt very estranged and disconnected with God. My mom never forced religion on me per se but allowed me to go and see how I felt about it. I left the church because I felt like it was just a bunch of lies and a scheme for power. In some ways, I still do feel that way but not entirely. I used to call myself an outright atheist. Over time though I've changed to agnostic and have noticed something within me that is spiritual and I need to give it another chance. So why am I here? Well, I just need some advice on how to well come back and get better in touch with my religious side once again. I'm going to start reading the bible outside of church more and maybe get in touch with some old friends I went to Sunday school with.",a4h0u6,self.Catholicism,,True
Does anyone want MANY used Catholic books?,Catholicism,"Hello, My mother is getting on in years, and has amassed a HUGE collection of Catholic (and more orthodox Protestant) books. We're desperately trying to downsize her stuff, but she insists that we store the books until we find a home for them. I and my siblings are running out of space to store these ourselves. Unless we find someone willing to take/use them, the books will likely decay in our storage until my mother eventually passes and will wind up in a landfill. This is a tough problem, as any potential recipient would need to put forth a lot of effort to ensure that no false-doctrine books are in the mix. Plus, few people read in this day and age, so the 'market' of recipients is small.

Are any of these sins mortal?,Catholicism,"I feel strange; to use an analogy I feel like I'm drunk (with sin) and I just don't know how drunk. This is not a complete list of all of my sins/ potential sins (after all this isn't the confessional) . I'm just wondering which of these are a) not sins b) venial and c) mortal because I can't tell. I don't know if I'm overly anxious or I'm trying to tell myself that I am overly anxious in order to excuse myself. Assume everything was done with full knowledge and full consent. &#x200B; 1. For a play we needed to create a racist character. There was some background music that we needed and I happened to have heard about a genuine White Supremacist group that makes music of that sort so I gave away the link. I did specify 'please dislike the video though' for obvious reasons. The video included a picture of two girls; the songwriters. Whilst the song did include two female voices I thought that since the girls on the cover looked pretty much like a stereotypical aryan they could've been inferred to be anybody (maybe not even connected to the movement) and not necessarily the singers. I happened to know it was the same girls because I knew about them from a documentary. When the time came to actually use the song I was asked 'Wait, you wanted me to dislike the video with the song of those girls before I go on it right?' to which I said 'Yes.' which essentially gave away the fact that they were the ones who had written the song and thus held those racist views. Was this detraction and a mortal sin? I mean; I should've known that it was easy to guess/ probable to assume that they were the ones who had written that song. 2. I made a joke that was kinda rude towards Muslims 3. I started humming the lyrics to a somewhat sexually themed song in the midst of friends who knew I was Catholic and all. 4. Is disobeying your parents in a small matter a mortal sin? (it's kinda silly but I have a tiny wound somewhere and Mom was pretty insistent on telling me not to scratch it but sometimes I did and some of those times I did it knowing full well what I was doing) 5. I talked with this guy that I kinda have some small set of romantic feelings for. 6. A friend of mine saw me talk to this guy and commented that we're gonna (awkward translation) 'combine' (which kinda means date). Is this scandal? (in the 'catholic' sense of the word not in the normal sense) 7. At some point somebody made a comment (kinda aimed at me, this was within a long context) 'Sex is aimed only at making babies after all' to which I said 'No actually' and proceeded because I didn't want them to think that I think that. We were all girls in the room but I knew that one of us might be a bit more fazed by the topic than the rest of us but I kept on for one or two sentences after anyways. 8. I clicked at a post on here that slightly made me doubt (on an emotional level) a certain aspect of our faith. I read in the catechism that cultivating doubt is a grave sin so how should I go about applying that. 9.

What are 'modernist' art and music?,Catholicism,"I've been contemplating lately about the effects that modernist art and music have on a person. We are taught by various saints and catechisms that we should only feed ourselves with refined music and literature in order to form ourselves into mature and non-vulgar people. Though I am interested in this discipline of sanctification, I'm having some trouble understanding this thinking fully, and I don't think I know any priests with whom I could have this conversation and raise all of my thoughts. I know priests who would only listen to classical music and operas, but I'm seeking some objective rules or guidelines on what secular music is good and bad. **My first question is, in general and objective terms, what is modernism (that is, the movement at large, not just the heresy)?** The Nazis despised modern art – particularly pieces that did not signify anything but just existed and called themselves art, and pieces that showed humans in a distorted or corrupted way. So they favoured traditional art that depicted humanity and nature in complete, natural, and glorious settings. **Do you think that, for Catholics, there is a benefit in avoiding art, humour, music, literature, etc. that are modernistic or ironic?** I wonder about the music genre called vaporwave. In general, vaporwave is a very elaborate and ironic parody of cheap, ambitious, 80s/90s corporate consumer comfort, and elegant, soulless commercialism. It is most often constructed by sampling, editing, and reconstructing other music, such as elevator music, 80s pop, and jazz. Imagine a 90s cable TV interface in a warmly-lit, modern luxury hotel room at 1am. A sparkling, gaudy, polished granite lobby in a Japanese commercial high-rise from the 80s. A digital encyclopaedia software demo preloaded onto Windows 95. The muzak that plays when on hold to a shopping channel hotline in 1994. All of those things, to an absurdly exaggerated degree, in the form of music. I feel that whatever vaporwave is, it can be done 'well' or 'poorly', and expresses an abstract idea that is real, and to which a certain group of people can all relate and understand. However, whenever I spend some time listening to it, it actually makes me feel quite isolated and depressed, and trapped in a sort of childhood nostalgia. It often has a melancholy sound or feel, which tends to suit its artificial, temporary subject matter. I wonder if this genre could be classified as modernism, because it is not necessarily aiming to be beautiful, but often deliberately ugly. The song and album titles often misuse and play around with language (English and Japanese) to give the vibe of cheap, attention-grabbing, virtual marketing. Some examples of 'unironic' vaporwave, if I can use that term (such as the 'tradwave' Instagram account), aim to imitate the retro aesthetic of vaporwave, but ignore the social critique aspect of it, which is in fact the whole point behind the original trend. But I wonder if, when that kind of art style is employed without the self-aware irony of the original, it ceases to be modernism? At that point, it's the innocent and honest appreciation of an artwork that is simply aiming to display beauty, isn't it? Maybe I'm really far off the mark and have no idea what I'm talking about. I feel like I could articulate this line of thinking better a few months ago, and I'm kind of just revisiting it now after a discussion with my housemate. **Do certain kinds of jazz classify as modernism?** The genre seems to break many musical rules, such as having chords that don't harmonise. It would appear to be a corruption of the 'sophisticated' music that preceded it. If I may liken it to the modernist heresy, it's as though the rules that always used to govern music no longer apply. I believe I have seen examples of jazz historically being critiqued by Catholics, or Christians more broadly, with a similar attitude to rap or metal now. I've come to appreciate some instances of experimental, avant-garde jazz, which follows even fewer rules than most kinds of jazz. **Can jazz be considered a 'refined' style of music in the traditional sense? Why/why not? What does 'refined music' entail and how would it play a role in sanctification in the comparable way to books?** I know I'm probably overthinking all these things, but I'd like to be more informed on these topics. This is a bit of a stream of musings but I do find it all incredibly interesting. Any thoughts would be appreciated.",a8a5mx,self.Catholicism,,True
What do you say to someone who lost a loved one?,Catholicism,"My associate pastor's older brother passed away the other day after a long battle with cancer. He was in his early 50s. Father has been gone all week and was with his family in the hospital when his brother passed. The wake is tonight (at a Baptist church-- it's a Latino family, but his brother became Baptist when he got married. Their mother was very upset he wasn't having a Catholic funeral, though someone told me he let Father anoint him a few weeks ago). My associate pastor and I talk on Facebook messenger a lot, so this morning I sent him a message just letting him know I'm thinking about him and praying for him and his family today. He started talking to me and I realized I had no idea what to say. I tried to be very understanding. He told me he felt drained and I told him to let God and those who care about him be his strength and to take care of himself and make sure he's eating and resting. I told him it's hard to lose a loved one and that it was good his brother had so many people he loved there with him in his last days. Father started telling me about his brother and what a good, kind, and humble-hearted person he was. He said his brother was a much better man than he is. I told him it sounds like he'll always carry a piece of him with him and it will help him be a better man. He said he'll try and I told him his brother is looking out for him in Heaven (though I'm pretty sure as Catholics we're aren't technically supposed to say stuff like that). He said yes and then I had to go to a meeting, so I told him I'm sorry he's hurting so much and I'll give him a big hug next time I see him and he and his family are in my thoughts and prayers today. Then I told him I'm sure he's busy today, so I'll leave him alone now and that I just wanted him to know I care about him. Does all that sound ok? I don't have much experience with this, especially when I didn't know his brother. Is there anything else I should say to support him going forward?

Tempted to despair,Catholicism,"I have a hard time of trusting God, because He will give mercy/grace to those He will and hardens the hearts of those whom He will (From Romans, I believe), and I fear He has not chosen me for mercy. I’ve been struggling with lust, and I fear that my multiple rejections of His grace are a sign that I will eventually fall away and go to Hell. I’m not devoted to the Rosary or Mary, which are great signs of predestination. It’s been hard to really trust God, because I’m worried that if I try to trust in His mercy or love for me that it would be in vain. I don’t know how to tell if I am truly contrite (a grace from God) for my sins or if I am just forcing it because I know I need contrition (self-will). I would like to be better, but I worry that my prayers are displeasing to God because I lack trust or pray from a place of pride. This fear tempts me toward despair that I can be saved, as without God we can do nothing, and I worry that God will justly withhold His help due to my continued relapses. I worry that my heart is too hardened to truly repent, and I don't know how to change that. I pray for repentance/contrition, yet I don't feel any changes, making me feel my prayers are displeasing. Any advice/prayers would be appreciated. ",a4duzv,self.Catholicism,,True

Did I just express sola scriptura?,Catholicism,"I was talking with an evangelical friend of mine and he asked how do I hold the Bible.

He then asked if I held it to ultimate authority and I said yes, but I believe the Catholic Church draws its authority from the Bible (and ultimately from God and Christ too, but the Catholic Church holds the true interpretations) and everything we due is from scripture, and the catholic doesn’t hold any beliefs that contradict the Bible. Then we got into a thing about faith and works, he showed me verses (I forgot them) and how James doesn’t mean what I think, I forgot what he said. After talking I realized I do not hold as much knowledge of the faith as I thought I did, and I shouldn’t debate because I might be giving false information of catholic beliefs",a4i4tn,self.Catholicism,,True

Returning to church: what is the difference between Holy Hour (and benediction) and Adoration?,Catholicism,"Sorry if it seems like a silly question but I can’t seem to find a clear cut answer. My understanding is that Holy Hour is time allocated for the parish to open its doors to allow people to come in and pray. Adoration is when the Eucharist is on display at the tabernacle allowing us to adore Christ. The parish I’m going to tonight has Holy Hour and benediction, but there is a separate time listed for adoration. So am I to assume the Eucharist won’t be on display, and this will simply be a time for prayer and reflection? Also, having never attended a Holy Hour before, what do you suggest doing in this time?

Can the Church learn anything from sports scandals?,Catholicism,"In the cases of Larry Nassar (Michigan State U.) and Jerry Sandusky (Penn State U.), the offenders were not only sexual predators but master manipulators. They created deceptive public personae that completely masked who they really were and cultivated close relationships with people in their organizations who could protect them. Could some sex abusers in the clergy or the bishops who covered up their crimes fit this pattern? I still find it hard to believe that Francis knowingly and willingly covered up for abusers, though a lot of that certainly went on at lower levels. Could it be that he or certain close advisors were beguiled in this way? Or am I just being naive? Are there any other useful parallels to be drawn?

Getting back into the faith,Catholicism,"First and foremost, forgive me if my rhetoric may come across as crude or offensive, it is not intentional.

After many years, I've come to realize that the lack of God in my life simply isn't helping me. And now since I'm dealing with so many issues, familial and with myself, I know that at least with knowing that God is here with me and is here to help me, I can push through without the need of tragic and terrible solutions to my problems. Besides my problems, this decision I've made is based on the fact that I refuse to be the godless person I once was, and bring back the important aspect of life in mine: religion, which is sadly seeming to fade away throughout many families and kids my age, especially. Luckily I happen to live in a European country that is quite religious (It starts with a P!), and there are many churches in my area. However, I don't know the language yet but I'll get there. I already do nighttime prayers (I have been doing so for about a year, but I know prayers may or may not be enough) but any other guidance on where to start is very appreciated.

How to know when your conscience is correct?,Catholicism,"Hey all, so I need some advice. I don't if you guys are like this, but I feel that I can't trust my own conscience when it comes to deciding what counts as grave matter. I know I also suffer from scrupulosity, which in turn is a result from me bottling up a sin I was ashamed of for years and never confessing it. By the time I forced myself to reenter a state of grace and actually live as a Catholic, accepting all of the Church's teachings, some 10 to 15 years had passed. That voice that kept on nagging me in my head to confess morphed into something ugly that can make my worry about sin a nightmare. As a result, I feel that I can't trust my own conscience. I try as hard as possible to remain in a state of grace and not sin, even venially. I abhor all types of sin. The thing is that it's impossible for me to be perfect and I end up sinning in the moment and making mistakes.

The Nature of Revelation in the Catholic Faith,Catholicism,"&#x200B; I'm in RCIA (candidate) and I'm trying to grapple with the truth of what Catholicism teaches about Sacred Scripture and Tradition. As a Pentecostal believer, I was told that the Bible was all we needed for life and godliness. I know the 'sola scriptura' issue is one of the biggest obstacles for Protestants. However, after spending some time in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception (one of the most beautiful places I've been in my LIFE) I began to see the power of the Blessed Virgin in one of the many shrines dedicated to her. I felt such a power and anointing and I found myself, for the first time, calling on her to help me, as though she was a real person who could hear me. I was not praying TO her or worshiping her obviously, just asking for her assistance and asking her to intercede to her Son for me. &#x200B; The nature of Christian revelation seems to be progressive. After all, the Old Testament Law was at one time God's program for the children of Israel when they left Egypt. 'God, who at many times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son,' (Hebrews 1:1). The reality of the 'sola scriptura' issue seems to be that the Bible is God's word and that all revelation moving forward from 1st century AD onward would confirm that revelation but also add to it and enrich it. It doesn't make sense to me that the Bible would be the container of all Christian revelation and truth, because there are so many issues not covered by the Bible. What would St. Paul write about contraception, Internet usage, abortion, and same sex marriage in today's context? What about climate change? It seems obvious to me that St. Paul (who authored most of the NT and all of its earliest documents) was writing with the knowledge he had as a 1st century Jewish person. It seems to me overall that Christian revelation is ongoing and progressive, as LONG AS it does not contradict the former revelation contained in the New Testament. This would account for the apparitions of Mary and many of the other traditions that Protestants accuse Catholics of 'adding' to Christianity and which Martin Luther so 'bravely' erased from his version of Christianity. &#x200B; Could someone provide some perspective on this? &#x200B; &#x200B;",a8kclk,self.Catholicism,,True

I mean I understand the idea but I can't figure out how to put myself into those shoes. I might be a twinge jealous because the idea of the priest as 'married to the Church' doesn't have the same ring to it. Even when I study someone like John of the Cross it still has a different feel to it. Obviously John of the Cross is very erotic in poems like Dark Night of the Soul but even then it doesn't feel the same as the vibes I get when I see female mystics discuss spirituality in matrimonial terms or even ordinary women religious seeing themselves as married to Christ. I wonder why that is? I know this is super vague but I have close female friends joining the convent and I can't make heads or tails of what they're telling me, even though I understand what every word means there's something there I think just by virtue of being a man I can't totally understand and even in those most loving moments of union of prayer between me and God I think it might be something different than what a woman experiences. I think I read something about in the Middle Ages women religious were considered closer to God because of this.",a8wmrc,self.Catholicism,,True

Tattoo of a cross? :/,Catholicism,"Hello, I'm 23 years old now. When I was in high school I got several tattoos - A dragon, a sparrow, and a skull. These tattoos don't have any meaning, I just got them because I thought that they looked cool. If I could go back and not get any, I would do that. But you can't change the past, and I had concluded I wouldn't get anymore. Anyway, lately I've been feeling guilty that I have some rather decent sized tattoos on my body - none of which are dedicated to my love for Christ. My mind keeps telling me that I should get another one (of a cross), to say 'At least if I have some tattoos - I have one for Christ.' I also feel that having something permanent marked on my body for him may be more convenient than wearing say, a piece of jewelry for him that I would have to take off, forget, etc. However, something in my heart tells me that I should not get anymore tattoos. That I should just leave them in my past and move forward as an adult... As getting tattoos never brought me much peace, it was more like a high. But again, I just feel guilty for having tattoos, and none of them are dedicated towards Christ. Any thoughts to put me at peace? Thank you... Edit: I guess what I’m trying to ask is, do you think God would be more pleased if I went ahead and got a cross tattoo (even though I don’t want anymore), or would he be more disappointed if I decided not to, and that I decided to stay content with having three pieces of art, none of which are devoted to him?",a5dfay,self.Catholicism,,True

I am fighting alone, supported by His arm, against all the difficulties that face me like unassailable walls. But I trust in the power of his name and I fear nothing. #824: In this seclusion, Jesus Himself is my Master. He Himself educates and instructs me. I feel that I am the object of His special action. For His inscrutable purposes and unfathomable decrees, He united me to Himself in a special way and allows me to penetrate His incomprehensible mysteries. There is one mystery which unites me with the Lord, of which no one – not even angels – may know. And even if I wanted to tell of it, I would not know how to express it. And yet, I live by it and will live by it for ever. This mystery distinguishes me from every other soul here on earth or in eternity. ",a73zzh,self.Catholicism,,True

P. S. I'm not actually gay, but since I never had a girlfriend yet, some people assume that I am gay. * Should a Catholic really consider it OK to force people to be religious again by putting them in the deep end (i.e. by encouraging them to consider joining the priesthood)? * The Catholic Church helped my family in our time of need.

Mortal Sin and Confession,Catholicism,"**The Question:** If a protestant or any Christian were to commit mortal sin, is there no way for them to mend their relationship with God besides Confession? Hey everyone. I was called to Confession yesterday and had a pretty powerful penance. I felt amazing afterwards and couldn't wait to talk to my girlfriend about it. While I was talking to her about she asked if I thought Confession is something that's required. I told her yes I believe that forgiveness of sins is required, and she, being protestant (non-denominational,) explained how she doesn't understand why the sacrament of Confession is required when we can just pray to God for forgiveness. I was pretty hurt and had my good mood all but ruined because I had this experience that meant a lot to me, was important to me, and she tells me she doesn't think it's a big deal. I was however also thankful for the chance to research and dive deeper into my faith. So after looking around on this subreddit and other places online, it is to my understanding that Confession is important because of the existence of mortal sin. While I was explaining my new understanding this morning on our way to drop her off at work, she asked me another question I did not have an answer to: if she were to commit mortal sin, is there no way for her to mend her relationship with God besides Confession? Or would she be lost and without grace indefinitely? Thanks to all for taking the time to read this and respond.",a25gnk,self.Catholicism,,True

"I want to be Christian.. leaning protestant, but something about Catholicism brings me back to it, time and time again.",Catholicism,"it just seems like everyone here in Canada, at least around me, happens to be Protestant.. or falls under the generalization. These Christians seem to only be Christian when people die, at weddings, etc.. nothing applies to their lives during the normal times, outside abortion and gay marriage. I might be doing them unjustly here, but this just seems to be my interpretation of these people. I know I have heard all of the pro Mary banter and negative Mary speak, but it doesnt help me decide on that issue either. It seems up in the air the impact of Mary on our lives, to me. I mean, Catholicism is the original Church. The Catholic Church is responsible for everything within the Protestant teachings that adds up to the basics of what is needed to properly understand the God Head, without Mary, with sola scripture, etc.. All of the big interpretations are from the Catholic Church. Even the Orthodox were okay with the Pope with the first 150 or whatever. I just have seen Jesus move.. Ive been worse than any Christian on earth.. I need redemption.. I have no one to really help me understand how to be dedicated and lead with the obvious nature of love and admiration only some Christians have. You know.. I do think i understand that it isnt protestantism, but im not sure i should write it off because of the general population, when the road to heaven is narrow. Im not saying Protestants are doomed, or Catholics, or Orthodox.. I just want answers.

On Cross necklaces there's a Saint on the back, similarly with the Bibles. I think I understand intellectually the place of the Saints, but it still makes me feel uncomfortable.

The Pursuit of Catholicism and Friendship with God,Catholicism,"Before I start, I want to say that this is my first post on this subreddit. I recently became a catechumen, but I'm not enrolled in RCIA (as of yet). I have been in a constant and very difficult struggle while trying to join the Church. I'm simply a teenager who's unable to drive, so I've been at the mercy of my protestant parents. Thankfully, they've been supportive of my conversion, and they've allowed me to attend two masses thus far (my first Sunday morning mass was yesterday!), and they've allowed me to get a rosary. Recently—for idiotic reasons, probably for nothing nobler than the sake of attention—I had lied massive disgusting lies to my closest friends. I'm not being scrupulous over a stolen piece of candy and lying about it; I'm being honest about the worst lie of my life. It has severely damaged my relationship. I won't go into detail, as they are between me, God, and those whom I offended, and I have every intention to confess it to a priest when able. I confess these sins to you, my brothers and sisters in Christ, as Jesus said to do. I have no where else to turn, so I turn to the amazing people of this subreddit. I've sinned against my friends, and, worse, I've sinned against God. I beg for your forgiveness, and I ask that you implore our Lord for mercy. I pray that my guardian angel rejoices at my confession rather than weep at my sin. I pray that God will forgive me. This has been a very heavy burden on my heart for the longest time, and I feel relieved to have confessed it, but at the same time I feel very sad and guilty for lying and hurting my friends. I ask for your prayers, and if you simply read this, it's more than I ever deserved. God bless. ",a70wsm,self.Catholicism,,True

Icons in the Roman Church,Catholicism,"Hey everyone, I was just watching  by Jonathan Pageau, an Orthodox icon carver. In the fragment that starts at 39:02, he discusses how he left Evangelical Christianity and after a spiritual crisis, discovered Western Medieval art where he felt like he found the truth. Unfortunately, he added, 'it [the Medieval age] is now gone', in the sense that that specific art style is no longer used (that's how he ended up a member of the Orthodox Church). Here's my question: what's the status of icons in the Roman Catholic Church? I've visited many Gothic and Baroque churches whenever I was in a new place, and while I did see many realistic *paintings*, I haven't seen *icons* in the classical sense of having a unified visual language. This is really strange, considering that in the iconoclasm controversy, the Roman Church defended icons, while the main iconoclast rhetoric came from the East. Does this have to do with the Renaissance? I've searched for the term 'icon' on this group and I see many people posted photos with their icons, but it doesn't seem like it's something mainstream.

Help growing in grace?,Catholicism,"So this may be quick since I am off go to work in an hour but I am writing for some help growing in my faith. Specifically in living it daily. I am going to Mass regulary but feel sort of at odds. Last week my friend sent me a YouTube video of a Latin Mass- that was rather beautiful and inspiring. He's rather become my spiritual go to guy and he is super traditional on some things, talking to is enriching on so many levels but I am left feeling sort of, well sort of not good enough. For example: when I want to pray the rosary I need an aid for the mysteries. What I normally do is offer my prayers or something or someone- ie my grandfather and his Alzheimer's, safe travels of family and friends or something else going on in life. I feel rather odd going to confession. How do you handle admitting to certain things? I always end up getting tongue tied and nervous. There is a Catholic church within walking distance and they use incense on Sunday- the parish my grandmother, mother and stepdad go to do not and some of the homilies seem wishy washy... also the music there is guitar and drums. Which I cannot abide during Mass. Before or after- ok it slightly annoys me before Mass but I can deal with it. Any suggestions on growing into the faith, as I want to be more fulfilled in life? I read articles on say the response of the Holy Father on what's come out about the various scandals and seemingly vast cover ups and I don't half think my buddy is right that the senior officials need to be dealt with if guilty, take out the rot and have another crusade. I feel like I'm going in a circle and am frustrated with myself. I'll probably add to this tonight at work and would appreciate any advice or conversation. Actually I think that's it too- I've no one I can really talk to besides my friend about this. Feel free to ask questions, and I'll be happy to answer. -Trav Some brief background: I was born Catholic but not really catechised well after my parents divorce in highschool. I was finally confirmed in college. I have always enjoyed going to Mass but not by myself, though that is changing. My stepdad is Canadian and an Anglican but regulary takes communion. When I asked my priest in college if my stepdad could take communion he replied that as an Anglican he could not. When I relayed this to my stepdad he got rather upset but didnt at the time. This is correct though? When my mom and stepdad are in town, them and my grandmother and I will attend Mass and then go to breakfast as a family. My folks's marriage was never annulled but both have remarried (obviously not within the church) and both are far happier. With their current spouse and I get on well with both step parents.

So have any of you had positive interactions or negative interactions with street preachers? How should we as Catholics deal with them?

Help with Marian devotion,Catholicism,"As a preface, I'm a Protestant convert. I've been pro-Catholic and praying the rosary for about ten years though I only officially came into the Church a little more than a year ago. But I have always loved Mary and found Marian devotions like the rosary, an image of our blessed Mother on my desk, etc. to be powerful and helpful. I have no issue whatsoever with her immaculate conception, her assumption, her heavenly queenship and her ongoing intercession. So recently I wanted to begin the Total Consecration to Mary as prescribed by St. Louis de Montfort. I read his short treatise on Marian consecration and found it really illuminating and not objectionable at all. I've even found, over the past couple of years, that prayers of consecration to Mary have been extraordinarily effective in combatting sin in my life. So far so good. But, as I have gone through the scheduled prayers for these 33 days of preparation for total consecration, I began finding myself feeling unsettled by some of the prayers. For instance, in St. Louis' prescribed prayer for the second week includes this line: 'May thy virtues take the place of my sins; may thy merits be my only adornment in the sight of God and make up for all that is wanting in me.' My only adornment? The merits of our Lady are great, but I dread asking God that her merits be my only adornment in his presence, when I could be adorned with the infinite merits of Christ. He writes in his prayer for the third week: 'Alas, O Lord! I am so wretched that without this dear Mother I should be certainly lost. Yes, Mary is necessary for me at Thy side and everywhere: that she may appease Thy just wrath, because I have so often offended Thee; that she may save me from the eternal punishment of Thy justice, which I deserve.' Does Mary save us from God's justice? Is it necessary to approach the Lord through Mary in order to be shielded from his wrath? Of course I could spin theological justifications to square this type of language. But if I'm honest, it's quite difficult to pray such a prayer without wincing. This has caused me to second-guess the fervor of my Marian devotion. So I am torn between two positions. I don't want to quiet my conscience, when there is a part of me that feels like a certain prayer or devotion might cross the line, so to speak, into idolatry. On the other hand, I feel that I am in part rejecting the authority of the Church if I were to say that some devotion, which has been approved and even encouraged by the Popes, is inappropriate or heretical. I'm not sure what I'm looking for exactly. But my 33 day consecration is set to be completed this Wednesday. And I don't want to do it if I'm feeling uneasy about it--which, right now, I do feel quite uneasy. But, on the other hand, I love our Lady, and have found devotion to her to be spiritually liberating. Any and all encouragements are welcome. ",a3xz0d,self.Catholicism,,True

What do you think? This felt miraculous,Catholicism,"I have been really ill with full blown flu for 24 hours or so I had to cancel all my work shifts. I was shaking so bad last night I could barely hold the cup of tea I made. I have *never* had a fever this bad, I joked with the wife asking if people ever die from the flu as my temperature was soaring and nothing was helping. I was at that pathetic noise stage where you groan and whisper random things over and over to kind of help yourself cope with it. I wasn't in any real danger as I'm early 40's and otherwise healthy, this was out of the blue. Now my poor mother-in-law has had this bronchitis for a while and I assumes I caught her cold, but there is no way she has this. You can't catch bronchitis anyway and as she's early 80's this would have knocked her flat. My father-in-law is very ill in hospital following diabetes leg amputation so I haven't seen him for a few days. Now what has all this got to do with my spiritual life? Well there's me imagining I was in a reasonable place not in danger of mortal sin having been to confession a few weeks ago and living quite a pious life. Well it just so happens my mother-in-law who we live with pleaded for me and my wife to get flu jabs like both of them had. With my father-in-law having OCPD condition and generally vulnerable it made sense. Well I ignored her and just never got round to it. So it hit me tonight...wow I could have bloody killed them with that casual attitude. Living in close proximity and not caring enough to look out for them. I have no idea if that was a qualifying mortal sin but the more I thought about it the worse I felt. I went in to my mother-in-law and apologised to her and text my father-in-law in hospital to apologise. I begged forgiveness from Jesus and promised to get to confession as soon as I could. After this still in that terrible shivering state I put my head down again in bed. 30 mins later the fever just went. I mean lifted like a heavy blanket it's *gone*. I went downstairs just like normal feeling pretty good actually. I still have the cough and blocked up nose but that life/death horrible fever...well it just left me. I'm certain God does some smack-down on us at times to shake us up. Honestly I think that was hanging over me and I had no idea! My wife doesn't live in my world, she's not religious so she would just pass it off as coincidence. I can't help thinking God or Our Lady was doing some signposting for me. God bless you. Edit- Oh better point out I have been taking paracetamol throughout the 24 hour period with no real effect up till that point. Of course it could have just suddenly kicked in or the fever naturally broke, it was just the timing and confession I was interested in. :)",a4559z,self.Catholicism,,True
Was this absolution valid?,Catholicism,"I'm fatigued. Sorry for continually asking for advice from a bunch of strangers online but I don't know where else to go. So basically I know that St Thomas writes that sometimes fraternal correction is an obligation. Sometimes I see people around me saying omg and stuff like that and I know that's grave matter (although I am essentially certain that they are not subjectively culpable for it). I'd politely tell my friends, particularly my Christian friends. Upon thinking I realized that I probably shut up in certain situations when I should've spoken up. So I went to Confession about it. I decided on a set of conditions (roughly) when I thought I had the obligation and a set where I didn't (ie. I'd be interrupting conversations, come off as rude, etc.) and should leave it for latter (only if I knew the person, not strangers unless they're younger kids or classmates whom I banter around with but might even stop at that exact moment if I felt it was opportune). I basically told myself that unless somehow directed otherwise I'd follow these instincts of mine and also try to discern individual situations to the best of my ability. Then I left that confessional after having confessed that and a bunch of other sins and I realized 'Wait... was that having the required purpose of amendment?' So I went in again today and I asked. Granted I didn't give specifics (partially because I was embarrassed that it bothered me so much and partially because there was a long que) and I don't think the priest (though very kind) understood me very well. So I essentially went in there, confessed sins committed in the meantime, asked him about the situation vaguely (which really didn't work out) confessed the old sins (with pretty much the same mindset) asked him slightly more clearly about what I meant twice (I had two things I was unsure about but they were similar. He thought they were connected but they were not. When I asked him about this I went 'I know we're supposed to try and tell people if they do something wrong...' and he said 'Yes.. (ready to start a but when I interrupted)' 'But yeah obviously I don't want to be mean about it.' and what he continued saying seemed to me at the time to confirm the mindset I had thought up). Was the absolution and the whole sacrament I had received invalid (or does it sound like that from what I'm describing)? Am I just being scrupulous or did I mess up? &#x200B; I mean... it genuinely is something that is up for discernment based on the situation but I'm afraid I set the standards that I set because I didn't want to comply to the real standards and thus have been deceiving myself.

Showerthoughts? Requirements to be Pope and the off chance of electing a non-Catholic?,Catholicism,"I was just day dreaming on a Friday. This is pretty far fetched, but just thought it would be an interesting topic. There seems to be a lot of speculation about the requirements to be Pope. It makes sense that the man chosen would likely be a practicing Catholic, but is that actually required under cannon law? My research has given mixed results, from saying it can be any baptized male, to saying they must chosen from among the Cardinals. If it is indeed any baptized male, and in the case of a non-Catholic, their election would result in them receiving any remaining sacraments of initiation, being ordained a Bishop and then elevated to Pope, all within a very short period after the election. So then, this begs the question, what if someone like Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew decided that he now believes everything the Roman Catholic Church teaches, talks about unification and as part of this effort gets elected, becomes Pope and the followers come with? Could something like this heal the schism with that segment of the Orthodox Church? ",a3zmrb,self.Catholicism,,True

Holy Day obligation question,Catholicism,"So, I mainly want to see if I was just being unduly stubborn in an argument. I didn't bring it up any further after first addressing it, because I knew I wasn't going to change his mind, but he insisted on telling others who weren't sure what to do what I believed to be in error, so we argued. Anyway, the parish we both go to had one Holy Day Mass in the morning, then normal vigil Masses in the evening. My contention was that only the morning Mass would satisfy the obligation for Immaculate Conception, the Vigil Mass would not satisfy the obligation for it as it was for the following day (the parish had already had a vigil Mass for the Holy Day on Friday). He cited this:  as proof he was right, telling me since 'Can. 1248 §1. A person who assists at a Mass celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the feast day itself or in the evening of the preceding day satisfies the obligation of participating in the Mass.' Saying that he could go to the Sunday Vigil Mass that evening, then go again in the morning, just he would be getting the same readings twice. I responded that he's thinking of the calendar day, not the liturgical day, which begins with either the Vigil Mass or Evening Prayer I, and I supposed we could go back to pre VII and there would only be the day, with no vigil Mass at all. He then told me that was Judaism and I would need to find the Canon defining 'day'. That went in circles until we were both angry and he was insisting on telling the people with us he was right and I wasn't an authority. I just went quiet then. What is actually the case? I would like to know, since this situation with consecutive obligations is bound to come up again and now I'm not certain any longer. Edit: grammar",a4gbel,self.Catholicism,,True

What should I make of this?,Catholicism,"I found asking about stuff like this on this forum amazingly helpful so I thought I'd give it another shot. It's a long story but if anybody bothers to answer I'm grateful, if not then I guess I used Reddit as my diary which is fine too. &#x200B; Basically I think that I've been going through a period of time in which I'm both highly sinful and highly fearful. It got progressively worse. Before this period started I was maybe too lax. For example I'd have no problem going to somewhat risque movies because I thought I was immune to it or at worst could just cover my eyes. I don't know if I'm actually scrupulous or am trying to convince myself and others that I am in order to allow myself to sin. I've come to a point where I go to Confession daily and some days (like today) most of the sins I confess are doubtful and I was actually pretty sure that half didn't happen but just said 'I think I might've done x' to be sure. &#x200B; The thing that troubles me most is whenever I hear people say 'omg' or things along those lines I think that I must either a) tell them somehow that it's not ok in case they're Christians b) tell them that it bothers me so that at least I prevent a grave offense (not discussing subjective culpability). This gets weird when teachers say this or people I hear in passing. I can't understand why it would not be a sin, even not a grave sin not to let that person know as soon as possible to prevent them from saying it again. Sometimes I don't because I think that the odds of scandalizing them are higher (though I think this is mostly false) or because I think they might've said it seriously or maybe I did not hear well. Am I thinking right or am I thinking very weirdly? Anyway I unsure about all this so I went to Confession and decided that I'll shut in a set of circumstances in which I thought I should shut up and speak in others but that if God somehow tells me otherwise I'll do what He tells me, just whatever He wants so I don't sin. This eventually led me to wonder if my purpose of amendment was real and thus if that Confession was invalid. I still worry about this and wonder about all of the Confessions I made since but to a much much much smaller extent. Today I did 'feel' some sorrow and although I knew it was likely that I'd repeat the same thing I really didn't want to and I still certainly don't. It's also weird since there is this priest at the parish I go to (it's a Cathedral parish) that never says the absolution formula or the words 'I absolve you of your sins', at least not out loud. I think he whispers them or something but being unsure makes me feel weird and besides I'm scared of him so I don't dare ask. I'm kinda scared that for one reason or another my past several absolutions have been invalid. &#x200B; During this weird period of time I also grew closer to Mary. I was just randomly ashamed of Jesus so I went and had some lengthy 'chats' with her in two instances. During both instances stuff happened that led me closer to Jesus. After the second of these instances I went to Confession, Mass, received Communion (after questioning whether I should) and then decided to go down to this Charismatic Catholic group that has a basement Chapel in the Cathedral. I knew that they had some sort of prayer meeting but that week instead of that they did Eucharistic Adoration. They said some reflections and stuff whilst the Eucharist was exposed and it was basically about Jesus meeting us where we are, in our sin and all and how He loves us regardless and is drawing us to a different life and all. The girl next to me said something along the lines (roughly translated of) 'Man this (I'm assuming the thoughts being shared) is so good' and both her and I let out a few tears. I decided to read a chapter of Luke daily for Advent. When I got home before I started reading I thought 'It would be really cool if it would be the Zacchaeus stuff now.' Apparently that really is what Luke 19 starts with. This girl who sat next to me said hi again to me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in a Life in the Spirit Seminary so I said 'Sure.' &#x200B; The thing is I feel like I have to question everything. What if I'm trying to use positive feelings to sort of deceive myself and hide my sin from myself? I feel like I wouldn't be a real Catholic if I went along a charismatic line (no offense to those of you who are Charismatic Catholics, I'm just talking about myself). I also don't want to fall into spiritual gluttony or to put friends I make or feelings or anything above Jesus Himself. I feel like I can't even approach Jesus sometimes though. Sometimes I feel/think I am super alright and confident and other times I feel scared and sad and live I've sinned and I'm separated from God and my intellect is not helping untangle it and praying about it so far hasn't fixed it all either so there ought to be some method of discerning whether I really am in a state of sin and need to change my life or I'm fine or relatively fine. I also kinda don't get how you're supposed to pray. Even before I went to this group sometimes in Adoration I'd feel like praising God and all and other times I'd just sit around thinking 'How am I supposed to love God now? Do I tell Him I love Him? What if my actions prove otherwise? Do they prove otherwise?'. I don't get how you pray if/when you don't feel anything or feel bad (as in bad in the sense of separated from God). So... what should I make of all of this? My mind's a mess and I don't trust my intellect or my feelings to tell me anything about myself. ",a80ioe,self.Catholicism,,True

I was thinking about something and got to a topic that had a slight mention of this stimuli. I knew that thinking about this was very likely to trigger this feeling but I thought I'd do it anyways because I can't keep avoiding the stimuli forever and that maybe this weird phase is past and I'll feel nothing at all and be fine.

Does God want mankind to artificially limit the celebration of the Sacraments – particularly the Mass and Reconciliation?,Catholicism,"Every day the exercise of both of these sacraments are effectively limited due to a shortage of priests. This shortage is due to a plethora of man-made reasons/decisions: the condition of many seminaries, the state of the hierarchy, the lure of secularism etc., etc. Most would agree it’s not a matter of God not providing us with enough vocations to the priesthood. Does it please God that the quality of many seminaries and prelates keep men from ever seriously considering the priesthood? Of course not. Does it please God for man to put the temporal delights of secularism ahead of the priesthood? Again, absolutely not. I’m truly curious, does it please God for man to rigidly define a process of priestly formation and lifestyle that also contributes to the priestly shortage (whether you want to admit to it or not)? I don’t think so, hence this posting. A priest’s ability to validly celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass or to hear confessions is not a product of him enduring 7+ years of seminary. It’s about the gift of Holy Orders he receives when he is ordained. Is there no way to thoroughly, form men for the priesthood in different manners that would ultimately render just as good, if not superior priests? I look to the model of retired priests where I live. Almost all live in their own homes, and almost all help out at different parishes – almost exclusively with celebrating Masses and hearing confessions. Why can’t men who live and work in the world, while also being priests, assist in a similar manner? Why are deacons allowed to execute their vocations in a similar manner, and priests are not? And while the priesthood is a hugely different vocation than that of the diaconate, why has man constrained it in such a way so that it cannot be exercised in part, in a manner like retired priests do today? While such men may not be ideally suited to pastor parishes, literally hundreds of thousands of them could be used to help bring the sacraments to parishes, prisons, jails, hospitals, etc., that either have no priest, or don’t have enough priests. Maintaining the integrity of the sacraments and the quality of their celebration is obviously absolutely critical. Both could be maintained by men who did not survive 7+ years of seminary, men who actually live in the world. I’m quite certain God realizes this. I wonder what He thinks about mankind not using all the means it could to make these two sacraments (and the others of course) more readily available to more people?",a3if23,self.Catholicism,,True
The technicalities of trusting God,Catholicism,"Dear all - ok I posted yesterday about how I'm going through a breakup. Sorry in advance for being mopey and sad. But this time my question is actually very objective: doctrinally speaking, when we're instructed to 'trust God,' what exactly does that mean? &#x200B; Here's what I mean by my question. I hate when people say 'everything happens for a reason' or 'what's meant to be will happen' or platitudes like that. Because technically, they're inaccurate. For example, a young woman having an abortion is not what was 'meant to be' and didn't 'happen for a reason' (not in the way that the phrase means it, at least). The abortion is not what God wanted, as part of His divine plan. (Now of course He can still bring good from a bad situation, but that's another topic for another day.) &#x200B; So because of my mistrust for these types of platitudes, and the extent to which I see well-meaning Catholics use them, I'm curious as to what 'trust God' actually means. For example, I'm heartbroken about breaking up with my bf because I really like him and I see all this potential in him that he doesn't see in himself (and/or refuses to embrace), but I know that it'd be wrong to stay with him because he's not ready to be a husband or father. I also understand that only he can change himself (through God), and that it'd be prideful to think *I* can change or fix him. So I just have to walk away and pray (have 'faith'?) that he'll figure it out sometime -- an act which honestly feels like I'm being pierced with the 7 swords. (Yes I know, I'm dramatic. lol) &#x200B; As I deal with the immense pain, my plan is to frequent Adoration/sacraments and restore my relationship with God and entrust my ex to His care. But in a very objective sense, and with respect to the fact that evil in our world is very real, to what extent can I actually/technically 'have faith' that God will take care of my ex and help him heal from the deep wounds that are holding him back? &#x200B; Hope this question made sense.

How can I get more out of the Psalm during the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass? (In both the Ordinary and Extraordinary Form),Catholicism,"**Ordinary Form**: Makes a bit more sense as it's a responsary.

I understand that pursuing a homosexual relationship is considered sinful. However, as a heterosexual man with homosexual friends, I always prayed for their well-being. We all sin, and no one is perfect. I believe that one can certainly not agree with something and still express the sentiment in a gentle and polite manner.

Protestant Churches in Germany and Austria are completely rotten,Catholicism,"In Germany the government legalized the “Ehe für alle' ('Marriage for everyone') in the summer of 2017. It is a euphemism for gay marriage. Now the Lutheran Church of Austria is debating acceptance of 'Ehe für alle' too. The Lutheran Church in Austria is likely to decide on this Friday, December 7, whether homosexual couples may be married in the future. In contrast to the Catholic Church, there is no separate marriage law, so married couples are just getting blessed. Another case: On the official website of the Multimedia-Competence-Center of the Protestant Church of Germany, you can ask questions considering the Christian faith. On February 22 a girl asked this: 'Is it okay for God, when I masturbate?' The answer was this: 'You can practice sexuality. You can practice what feels good, what makes you feel good and how your body is ticking... If you could talk more openly about the subject, it would quickly become clear that masturbation does no harm. To the contrary: Who knows his body, can also speak more openly and confidently about sex in a partnership - can say what he or she wants and most importantly, what not!'

"Germanys biggest conservative newspaper is paying a female columnist, who is a prostitute. She glorifies her 'work' in her articles. How should Catholics navigate through modern media?",Catholicism,"The german newspaper 'Die Welt' has a weekly column by an escort girl called Salomé Balthus. She is the daughter of an artist-couple and studied philosophy. For many years now she is working as a prostitute and has an agency, which is 'renting' other young women to men.  I find this highly problematic. In Germany all mainstream media is left-leaning. 'Der Spiegel', 'Süddeutsche Zeitung', 'Die Zeit', 'Frankfurter Rundschau', 'Der Stern', etc. The biggest conservative newspaper 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung' (FAZ) has become indifferent and is also left-leaning now. The only newspaper that has preserved a somewhat conservative view, 'Die Welt', is also becoming more liberal. But they also have articles by german catholic writer Birgit Kelle, which is nice. In the last couple of weeks I repeatedly thought of how we as Christians or Catholics should navigate through modern media. I don't want to subscribe to a newspaper which is glorifying prostitution. And I don't want to give them clicks either so they can cash in from online ads. If I want to read news from a conservative or even non-biased view, I often have to surf the intellectual dark web (a term coined by Eric Weinstein used for Bloggers, Thinkers and Commentators like Dave Rubin, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, etc.).

Question concerning the Lord's Prayer,Catholicism,"Salve Sororis Fratrisque, Like many of you I'm very interested in the new translation of the Lord's Prayer. I understand the desire of the Vatican to better convey the meaning of the words of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I have always found the English translation of '*et ne* *inducas nos in temptatione'* to be troubling. However my reason for this is not only on theological grounds. I've seen in other postings and discussions the trouble many of us have with the idea of asking the Father not to lead us into temptation. I find these valid. The Father does not lead us into temptation, but He does deliver us from evil. What I do not find valid is asking the Father not to abandon us in temptation. God never abandons us. It is we, in our weakness, who abandon God. So why is this new translation any more valid? In fact, I find it just as troubling, and less faithful to the Vulgate. To find a more theologically solid and faithful translation from the Latin we must examine the Latin itself. This is what I ask help with: why have we translated the word *inducas* into the hortatory? For those of you who are less familiar with Latin, prayers follow the hortatory form which is the same as the imperative conjugation. Thus, in the Lord's Prayer, we ask to be given (*da*) our daily bread and to be forgiven (*demitte*). But if we were to be asking the Father not to lead us into temptation why would it not be *induce*? The second person imperative never ever finishes in s. *Inducas* is thus not imperative or hortatory. It is however the present indicative form for the second person singular. This is why when I translate the Lords' Prayer into English I say 'Our Father... *You* *lead* us not into temptation, but deliver us from Evil.' Now think about this. Does it not make more sense to affirm as a precept of faith that the Father does not lead us into temptation rather than asking Him not to? The Lord's Prayer begins with a statement of fact, why should it not end with one as well? Perhaps I'm wrong on the Latin. It's possible. I only did an undergraduate degree in Classics. If so, please let me know. If I'm somehow in error theologically and have slipped into an unbeknownst heterodoxy please enlighten me. Far be it from me to doubt the magisterium's expertise in Latin. They must have a reason for not seeing what seems obvious to me. Perhaps Jerome mistranslated the verb from the Greek, or perhaps the Greek translation from Jesus' Aramaic words is at the source of the confusion? I lack the expertise in either language to say. If one among you does, please feel free to add to the consideration above. I would end by saying 'May God bless us all' (hortatory), but this too seems wrong. As does saying 'God bless us all' (imperative), as I would never presume to command God. I will however say 'God blesses us all.' Because that is the truth. &#x200B; Pax Christi Vobiscum",a5v6td,self.Catholicism,,True

May the glory of thy moral government be advanced, and the great laws of it be more generally obeyed — May the inhabitants of this world pay as chearful a submission and as constant an obedience to thy will, as the happy spirits do in the regions of immortality. As thou hast hitherto most mercifully supplied our wants, deny us not the necessaries and conveniences of life, while thou art pleased to continue us in it. Pardon the numerous errours and sins, which we have been guilty of towards thee; as we freely forgive and erase from our hearts the injuries that our fellow creatures have done to us. Suffer no temptation to assault us too powerful for the frailty of our natures and the imperfection of our virtue—but in all our trials may thine almighty aid interpose and rescue us from vice and ruin—These requests we address unto thee, for thou art possessed of power which enables thee to succour, and of goodness, which disposes thee to befriend all thy creatures—and these thy glorious perfections will continue immutable, and be the objects of praise and adoration throughout all the ages of eternity!

The language of God and Angels?,Catholicism,"Hello everyone, I am a confirmed and practicing Catholic but I also attend Shabbat dinners at a local Rabbi's house. I am not Jewish nor am I interested in conversion. I do, however, find value in studying the old laws and I believe they offer insight into our Catholic beliefs and why we believe what we believe. Furthermore, I feel that what separates us from Protestants chiefly are the ideas that we have respect for tradition and the old laws. They are nice to me at this dinner, accept my beliefs with open arms, and they do not proselytize to me or do I proselytize to them. Some of them have a negative view of Catholics and I feel I am not only learning a lot about the roots of our faith but also dispelling a lot of the negative stereotypes about Catholics and Catholicism. With that out of the way, it brings me to something I learned tonight and I was curious what the Catholic stance on it is. In Judaism, there are prayers in Aramaic and Hebrew. I asked why this is and there's a historical explanation - that many of the common people spoke Aramaic and not Hebrew, so Jewish priests (Kohens) translated some of these prayers from Hebrew to Aramaic. The difference is that, according to the Jews, Hebrew was the language of creation. It is the language that God gave to Abraham and it is the language with which he created the world, the angels, etc. Because it was the language used to create Angels, it is the only language that Angels can understand. Angels, again according to Judaism, help deliver our prayers to God. They believe that praying in non-Hebrew requires more fervency to be heard because you're trying to get a direct line to God (For God understands all languages), Angels won't deliver your prayers because they do not understand them. In fact, they might get annoyed at such prayers unless the prayers are prayed by a sufficient enough congregation (more than ten people). This doesn't pose much of an issue for masses, for a mass is one large prayer by a congregation. Whether it's performed in Latin, English, Spanish, Hebrew, Aramaic etc. it's a prayer to God and God understands all languages. However, this does pose some complications when praying alone. I don't believe God needs angels to help ferry the prayers of the faithful to him or that prayers delivered by angels get his attention more - but it couldn't hurt could it? I've considered learning Hebrew so I could read the Old Testament in its (somewhat) original form and learning Aramaic so I could read the New Testament but I've never gotten around to it. What's the position of the Catholic Church on language? I personally enjoy the Latin mass and now say my personal prayers in Latin for the most part. What's the Catholic Church's position on angels?

In addition some of the vitriol I've seen fellow Catholics, mainly traditionalists, hold toward anything that challenges their own views and the recent scandals haven't done anything to help my doubt. Ordinarily these things wouldn't bother me, but for some reason this lack of certainty has been really bothering me. Before I felt that nothing could shake my faith, but now I feel I can barely hold it together. Even worse, because of this doubt I've been constantly thinking of death and how likely it's just oblivion, and I've been terrified just trying to understand it. I just have no idea what to do.",a52ywa,self.Catholicism,,True

Christmas Message From Outer Space,Catholicism,"It was December 24, 1968, 50 years ago this upcoming Christmas Eve, that astronauts on the first manned space mission to circle the Moon transmitted a message that provided hope and encouragement for hundreds of millions of people back on planet Earth. It had been a tumultuous year in America and around the world, and their message provided a great sense of unity and peace — a message that's applicable today and for all eternity. Apollo 8's crew, Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders had launched their historic and dangerous flight on December 21. It took them 68 hours to travel 240,000 miles to the Moon, but their reward was spectacular. They became the first humans to orbit another celestial body, to see the bleak far side of the Moon, and to witness a stunning 'Earthrise,' photographs of which provided the first human look back at our own planet. On that Christmas Eve, people around the globe watched the grainy televised images recording Apollo 8's view of the Moon's surface below them. On their ninth lunar orbit, Borman began their television transmission with an introduction of the crew. Each gave their perspective on the Moon's surface, with Borman describing it as 'a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing.' Then, unexpectedly, the astronauts began reading the Creation account from Genesis. **William Anders**: 'We are now approaching lunar sunrise, and for all the people back on Earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send to you. 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, 'Let there be light.' And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness.'' **James Lovell**: 'And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.' And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.' **Frank Borman**: 'And God said, 'Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas. And God saw that it was good.' Commander Borman finished the broadcast, saying, 'And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you — all of you on the good Earth.' It was 2.5 hours later that the crew began a critical burn from the far side of the Moon, out of contact with mission control. This burn had to be carried out with absolute precision in order to put the astronauts back on a track to leave the Moon's gravitational force and begin their return to 'the good Earth' on Christmas Day. That burn went exactly as planned, and upon reacquiring contact with Mission Control, Jim Lovell's first words were, in his humorous style: 'Please be informed: There is a Santa Claus.'",a8d0nt,self.Catholicism,,True
Acting with a doubtful conscience,Catholicism,I was in Confession today and at some point I doubted whether I had lied when explaining something and did not explain enough. I wanted to stop and tell him that but I didn't. I'm not sure why but I think it was a combination of the following reasons (in no particular order) &#x200B; a) I did not want to feed my scruples b) It was during Mass and we were both kind of rushing c) It felt awkward d) I was pretty sure I hadn't done it or at least felt that I was pretty sure &#x200B; Latter on I thought about it and realized that I explained the whole ordeal just fine but that since I had a doubtful conscience then I committed a mortal sin by basically acting (in this case not acting) whilst doubtful.

My question is, what does this mean as far as feasting? It seems as though this calls for perpetual absitence and penence. Furthermore this lifestyle is very hard, not just saying know but even the option of saying no (for instance doing fun things during a date).

How can i obtain peace of mind with my scruples?,Catholicism,"So over the last week I've had a pretty awful time with anxiety and scruples. While reflecting on my academic career, I've hyper-focused in on weird little mishaps that have happened during exams. And even though I didn't cheat, I can't help but feel unbearable guilt. Like, for example, during a take home exam I had checked facebook a few times. Nothing that i put down on the exam contained anything that I saw on facebook, but I can't help but feel like I broke a rule and that I can't have peace of mind unless i go make some big confession to the law school and face some sort of extreme punishment. Which also scares me because any mark of academic punishment basically disqualifies me from taking the bar exam. Ive been praying for days for peace and good judgment but nothing has come my way yet.

A Way to Explain the Immaculate Conception with Scripture,Catholicism,"One common complaint of this doctrine is that it's not in scripture. I was reading Ephesians 5, and one bit jumped out as a potential proof text for the Immaculate Conception. Mary is the mystical spouse of the Holy Spirit. In a lesser sense, we are all wedded to God when the Holy Spirit descends on us at our baptism- that's why by baptism we are initiated into the Bride of Christ, which is 'one flesh' with Christ and therefore may also be called the Body of Christ. Like a baptism, the Holy Spirit 'overshadowed' Mary and by that, she begat a Son. That's a very marital kind of relationship. So we see Mary as God's Bride in a very unique and *really real* way. Jesus wasn't a bastard, but rather born of the legitimate, marital relationship between Mary and the Holy Spirit (though in a mystical way, not sexual way). That leads me to my reflection on this passage about marriage: >Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. We tend to read that as a passage about marriage, but even St. Paul says that he's really writing more to convey truths about Christ and the Church rather than marriage, even though he's writing about marriage. Mary is God's Bride in a super special and unique way. That means that God would have sanctified her, purified her... made her to be without spot or wrinkle or any blemish. *Immaculate* means nothing other than 'unstained', 'unblemished', 'without spot'. God knew from all eternity (because He is all-knowing) that Mary was destined to be His Bride, so He kept her immaculate, so that He could present her to Himself in splendor. -- Do you guys have any other Scriptural defenses of this doctrine?

Life-Long Catholic Going Through a Crisis of Faith,Catholicism,"I was born and raised a Catholic in an Irish neighborhood in New England. Both of my parents are essentially 'cultural Catholics' if you get what I mean. My mum is a fervent agnostic who identifies with Catholicism only to the extent that she likes the whole Jesus deal, but she doesn't really care for theology, Mass, or Catholic social teaching. My dad is a sedevacantist, borderline Evangelical Protestant who's convinced that the Church has been taken over by Hispanics and Muslims (Yes, he really does say bizarre shit like that without a hint of irony). Neither of them regularly go to Mass, but I try to go every week if I can since the nearest parish is within walking distance and I go to a Catholic high school that offers services twice a week. I've never doubted the existence of God, and still don't. I feel very strongly His presence in my daily life. However, recently, I've started to have doubts that certainly don't cross the line into agnosticism by any means, but are still undoubtedly heretical. In past years, I've always more or less accepted Church teaching, but there are some things that I've struggled with recently again and again. And I'd like to preface this by saying that these aren't positions that I'm trying to defend as points of argument. I'm trying to reconcile my thoughts, and I'm hoping you guys can do your best to bring me over to the 'light side of the force.' I've gotten into extensive theological discussions/arguments with a militant atheist who can't stand the idea that there are people who believe in God, although otherwise she's a great person and a good friend of mine. I've found time and again that I can't defend my own arguments because I don't know why I believe what I do, which is something I'd never really though about extensively before. I can't come up with a reasonable rationalization for why our faith is 'correct,' while others are 'wrong,' and I haven't been able to find a satisfying answer to this question. For one, how do we know Christ really is the son of God? When it comes down to it, the only evidence we have of His miracles are from a book, and books can be wrong. And if we assume Christ is the son of God, how do we know the Catholic Church is the 'correct' Christian church, assuming there is one at all? The Orthodox Church has just as much of a legitimate claim to direct continuity all the way back to Peter, no? And even if we do have the best claim to legitimate continuity from Christ to Nicaea to today, how can we say that we've the most correct theology when the Church's policies, practices, and teachings have shifted and reformed so much over the past 2,000 years? I've also started to have doubts about some of the Church's views on certain matters. While I generally agree with the vast majority of Catholic social teaching, there are some things I can't bring myself to believe no matter how hard I try. For one, I can't understand why homosexual acts between two consenting adults and masturbation in moderation are considered sinful. Second, I can't bring myself to believe that not being Catholic could be an obstacle to entering Heaven if the individual is otherwise a godly and moral person. I realize that there's scriptural evidence to support all of these views, but this scriptural evidence doesn't line up at all with what my conscience tells me.",aa8cpu,self.Catholicism,,True
"I’m conflicted. I have a fear of exposing myself to anti-religious thought because I fear losing my faith, but I also want to expose myself to it because I want to understand anti-religious people and their arguments.",Catholicism,"I’m torn. One of my best friends is an extremely kind hearted person. Despite me converting to Catholicism and him being an atheist, we still have an incredibly close friendship. We often have discussions and debates and the topics vary a lot, but whenever religion comes up I shy away because in my gut I feel that I don’t have any argument to persuade him. I believe in God because of faith, but if someone rejects faith, I don’t know of any way to engage in a fruitful conversation about it. Each time something like atheism/religion or abortion comes up, the talks just kind of end with me changing the subject or just getting quiet and saying a silent prayer. But I can’t resolve it. Wouldn’t God want me to learn as much as possible? If I truly believe in God and that he is truth itself, I shouldn’t be scared of seeking truth. I shouldn’t be scared of reading any number of atheist philosophers. But I am. So I guess I don’t truly believe? I don’t know. I get frustrated sometimes and wonder why faith is necessary. Why can’t God just reveal himself to everyone. Why doesn’t God just show every single person irrefutable proof of his existence? It’d be so much simpler. Why put us in a tangible world and ask us to put our belief into something unverifiable? I just don’t understand. I wonder what would make a Moses so special. Why show himself to Moses and not the whole world? Why not show himself directly to Pharoah? Wouldn’t that act in itself achieve everything he wants? I still will continue to go to RCIA and I’ll convert and I’ll do my best to live a virtuous Catholic life, but I have so much doubt I wonder if it’s all for naught. Will I live my life as pious as I can only to die and be judged to not have had too much doubt and be damned to hell? Then why give me this curious nature? Why not just make me with unshakable faith in the first place? I don’t understand God’s reasoning behind a lot of things. If I become a father and my child would literally burn to death if I didn’t simply show myself, I’d show myself. Why doesn’t God do this in a way that requires no faith? Why doesn’t God just straight up let me observe him with the senses he gave me? ",a1ypn5,self.Catholicism,,True
When does God intervene?,Catholicism,"There are several times in my life where I believe I've seen God's hand at work. This makes me think that even though we're free to make our choices, and there's no predestination, God is actively involved in helping shape our lives. Yet there are instances where I'd hope God would intervene, and that help isn't apparent. A friend in her forties is back in the hospital again after her cancer came back. She has two teenage children and is a devout Catholic, isn't she a good candidate for direct intervention? Selfishly, I also wonder about my own circumstances. My daughter is taking entrance exams for Catholic high schools, and caught something and was sick the day she took the test. She finished first in three out of the four tests, on the final test she had to leave the room several times and was unable to finish, giving her a lower grade and eliminating her chance for a scholarship. Any other day she would have aced that test and gotten a scholarship worth half the tuition cost, without that help she cannot attend that school. Did God intervene then? Was it not in His plan for my daughter to attend that school? Did He not intervene and it just turned out that she was just sick that week and the day of the test? I've always had a hard time reconciling our stated value to God, number of hairs on our head, etc., versus our apparent value to God, illness, accident, etc. Based on my past observation of God's involvement, I never know if I should expect direct involvement or think that's saved for particular circumstances. What circumstances warrant direct invention? There are two times in my life where I cannot believe God wasn't arranging things, but could it be I'm seeing God at work when He wasn't a participant?

My priest's homily made this the best Christmas I have had in a long time,Catholicism,"It actually happened last week at Mass. The priest's homily was essentially about how people tend to have high expectations about Christmas and get sad or upset when it does not go as expected. But he talked about how Christmas did not go as expected for Mary and Joseph either. Mary was pregnant before marrying Joseph, and in those days it was legal for the man or his family to literally stone the woman for committing adultry, which is likely what would be assumed of Mary. Obviously Joseph did not expect Mary to be pregnant. Also the scripture talks about Mary hastily leaving to visit Elizabeth, likely to avoid the before mentioned stoning. Mary fearing for her life was not likely something she was expecting. When Herod called for a census, Joseph and Mary had to travel to Bethlehem, again not something they were expecting. But the part of the homily that got me was when the priest talked about the actual Nativity. Jesus's birth was not as picturesque as it is often described. Mary had to give birth in a filthy stable surrounded by dirty animals. Surely Mary and Joseph anticipated having Jesus born at their home, not behind an inn in a dirty barn. My priest said, 'Mary and Joseph did not have Christmas they were hoping for, so it is ok if this Christmas isn't the best for you either.' The past several Christmases have been hard for me because many people in my family have been fighting, people get too caught up in presents and festivities, and now that I am older, my family doesn't do the same traditions we used to do when my siblings and I were younger. I have spent so many Christmases in my room crying or just trying to get through it because my expectations were always wrong. This Christmas, however, has been great. I told myself not to make any expectations and just enjoy my day off from work with family. And I've had a blast! I have had some of the best conversations with my parents, got to play with my 2 year old nephew and enjoy watching him unwrap his presents, and I even hugged my sister whom I have been having a difficult time being around because of past experiences that caused our relationship to be strained. I am smiling as I write this post, and I just wanted to share my story. I know we often tell ourselves we dont care about presents and things like that, but I think it was changing the mindset that Christmas is supposed to meet certain expectations that has helped me have the best Christmas I have had in almost 10 years. I hope you all have a blessed Christmas as well! God bless!",a9ium8,self.Catholicism,,True
Did Augustine believe in the devil?,Catholicism,"Hello all, I have been reading *Confessions*, which I really like by the way. I really like Augustine's theology and philosophy in the book, and from what I understand, it is actually the least philosophical of his well known works. I am excited to dig into those after I'm done with this one, but I haven't started on them yet. I am really amazed at how similar his views were at the time he wrote this (about 397 AD) to modern day Catholic views. I think it really is eye opening to just how sound the doctrine is. However, one thing perplexed me, and I am not sure if I am just misunderstanding or what. It is his ideology on the concept of evil. He wrote in Confessions that he does not believe that evil actually exists, but that what we call evil is just a twisted version of something that is otherwise good, and this twistedness separates us from God. For example, he pointed out that when he was committing the sexual sins from his teenage years, he was yearning for a true, undying love, which is a good thing, but the way he pursued it was twisted against the way God wished for him. He goes on to say that a lot of people view evil as this distinct being that is wandering the world actively trying to turn us against God, but he seemed to imply that he did not believe that. At this point, I realized that at least my own interpretation of evil is like what he is saying is false. I think of demons prowling the world, seeking the ruin of souls, like in the St. Michael prayer. In Confessions, he only dabbled in this philosophy, but I was wondering if he has anything in his other books where he discusses the devil, demons, and their role. Also, does the Church accept that everything Augustine wrote was theologically sound, or are there any areas where the Church's teaching opposes his philosophy?

When is dating fine?,Catholicism,"(warning this is probably too much of a rant and comes from somebody who probably overthinks too much) I frequently talk with a guy, we just get along very well but recently my female friends have commented and said that we're really just flirting and are going to go out eventually. I don't want that since I've had good friendships ruined in the past when I've tried to make them romances but since they've said that I have 'noticed' that he seems oddly preoccupied with talking to me and that maybe he really is flirting which got me excited and made my heart beat weird and chest feel warm and all. I 'defended' him once when somebody said that she congratulates me for talking to him since he doesn't really talk to many people to which I replied (partially out of genuine surprise, partially out of a romantic sentiment and partially because I really did want to defend him) 'I can't believe that. He's really extroverted and friendly and funny.' Then when we talked today and were alone I got that weird feeling in my chest again, it wasn't super strong but it was persistent and I hated it because I didn't want to ruin our friendship and I didn't want to get disappointed if the speculations of my friends were untrue. &#x200B; So two questions: &#x200B; 1.

Finding a good parish - warning signs,Catholicism,"Hello guys, not officially a Catholic yet, but considering becoming one on the next go around of RCIA. In the meantime, I'm enjoying dabbling in what I can. I have a rosary and some other devotional items, I'm researching the history of the church and the saints...it's been an amazing experience so far. The one thing I'm struggling with is finding a really good parish that I would want to take RCIA courses at and have become my home. I'm looking for a church that's very traditional, reverent, incense, all that good stuff...ideally one that offers TLM, but I can't find any around me that do. I'm in a very small town and there's a handful of churches within 30 minutes of me, but so far, nothing has really impressed me a whole lot. The one church whose mass I liked the most I later found out has kind of has a negative reputation among my Catholic friends (it's a long story, but basically a few years ago, there was a priest involved in embezzling, defrauding the parish, wasting church money, etc...he's no longer in the area, but still practices) so now I'm not so sure about my judgment in finding a home church. I guess I'm curious if this window shopping approach is even the right way to go about things, or if I should just pick one and live with the flaws. Maybe it'll grow on me more? Or if it's a good idea to look around and compare churches, what kinds of things should I be looking for in the mass, on the website, etc? There's a running joke with my husband that the better a church website looks, the worse the church itself is (and it's been true so far). Are there any key phrases I should be looking for online or things I should keep an eye out for in the actual mass? ",a9a46h,self.Catholicism,,True
Holy Days of Obligation on Saturdays and Mondays?,Catholicism,"Hello! I am currently going through RCIA and I am still learning. I want to better understand Holy Days of Obligation.

A few questions: * Is my understanding accurate? * Are there any exceptions? * Can we get opposite credit? That is, go to a Saturday / Monday Mass for a Holy Day of Obligation and then miss Sunday Mass? Obviously, I will try to attend every Holy Day of Obligation and Sunday Mass, but it helpful for me to at least know / understand this.

Adding the Prayer to St. Michael into mass disrupts the unity of or universal church just as much as hand-holding at the Our Father,Catholicism,"When I was a child, one of the parts of mass that I most looked forward to was the Our Father and the connection to the community and to the Divine presence within those gathered that I felt in holding hands with family and friends. Over the last decade, I've seen many communities counseled away from hand-holding during the Our Father. I resisted this change for a long time because it was so meaningful to me, but I spent a lot of time talking to people who were asking for that change, reading about the issue and praying about it. I prayed that my heart not be hardened and that, if this be God's will, I would be able to let go of my own personal emotional connection to that experience of holding hands in favor of the global good of our church and the perfect participation in the mass. While many arguments given for moving away from holding-hands failed to resonate in my heart, over time, I began to appreciate the call to consistency with the Roman missal, the authoritative source for the order of the mass. While I appreciated the opportunity to connect with those physically present at mass with me through holding hands, I began to appreciate that in not holding hands I could be in closer communion with the universal church. By holding an alignment with the mass as written, not adding or removing anything, I would be connected to the Catholic community across the globe, with brothers and sisters participating in the mass in Argentina and the Philippines and Norway and the Congo. And as someone who has travelled a fair bit, I was able to see that global communion first hand as I was able to participate in masses in Central Asia, Australia, Costa Rica and more. It is beautiful that the mass transcends language and culture to connect us all. Just as I was learning to appreciate the value of the consistent recitation of the mass, a new trend began to sweep through Catholic churches in the US. More and more churches began saying the Prayer to St. Michael at random places in the mass disrupting the unity that had come to see as quite meaningful. What's more, it seemed to be the same people and communities arguing against the hand-holding who are the most insistent on adding in the new prayer. What am I missing here? Either the mass is a perfect prayer lacking nothing, designed to unite us all in a mystical universal communion or not. (And I know that a some churches circumvent the whole 'added to the mass' thing by having it after the priest has said that the mass has ended... But if the community is still gathered and people are not free to exit the pews and move on with their day then then it's really part of the same liturgical event. I'd say that's one of the worst places to add it in because then then people who are visiting from another community who don't know that prayer walk out the door with the last experience of your community as one of exclusion. And Catholics shouldn't be in the business of making each other feel excluded.) ",a5wy53,self.Catholicism,,True

"In-law 'marriage' dilemma, need advice",Catholicism,"My mother-in-law is planning to 'marry' a man whom she takes care of. This man has been disabled from the neck down for the last 30 years cannot care for himself. She started working for him a year ago they almost instantly fell in love with each other, even though she was living with a different man... she moved out of her old boyfriends house into the house where the disabled man lives. She receives payment from the state for taking care of this man. (He lives with his parents so their bills are non-existent.) I have a hard time being happy for them in their situation because this man claims to be a Christian who talks to God everyday, has led my MIL to be open to God, yet they are unmarried, sleep in the same bed, and also somehow commit unchaste acts together. (I can't conceive how intercourse can occur if he can't feel below his neck constantly wears a catheter) So a couple months ago they got engaged instantly told us that they were going to have a wedding but not a real wedding, because if they had a real wedding had it recognized by the state my MIL would not receive compensation for taking care of the man. They aren't getting married by a judge, or a pastor, but exchanging private vows and calling it a marriage because they believe the piece of paper means nothing it will be seen in the eyes of God. She even plans on changing her last name. The man has asked my husband to be the best man they want us to attend this 'ceremony.' We don't feel morally ok at all participating in what I call a 'pretend wedding.' We also have children don't want to set a bad example for them in regards to marriage.

We got pregnant before marriage but truly love each other got married in the church put our faith in God that He would hold our marriage together. He surely has because we have experienced grace love in our marriage and are currently pregnant with our fifth child. We pray that our marriage can be a light to our children an example of what marriage is supposed to look like. We both feel that this 'pretend marriage' makes a mockery of our own that it sends the message to our children that marriage is whatever you make of it.

Desire to sin after given perfect knowledge for why it is wrong?,Catholicism,"I don’t know where to start or my exact question, but I’ll do my best. Let’s start with background: I have a sin that I used to struggle with deeply. I knew it was wrong for several years as I wrestled with it, but I couldn’t quite break free. God slowly but steadily revealed more and more about the sin to me until I essentially had perfect contrition about it. (He showed me why it was harmful to myself, how I was using this sin to fill a gap for which I should be turning to him, how it was harmful to others, how it enabled others to turn away from God when they should be relying on him, as well as how it was potentially harmful to others in the future.) Basically, I got to a point where I couldn’t choose to sin in this way anymore. It felt too painful to willfully engage in this sin after being entrusted with all that wisdom. God had really given me his eyes towards others and myself in regard to this sin. I’ve been very strong at resisting this sin and have been successful for the past ~6 months. I even had a dream about committing this sin 2 months ago and felt deep guilt in the dream, as my dreamself reflected on all the reasons that the sin was wrong. However, tonight, I am feeling hurt and vulnerable. I ended up really messing up in another area earlier, thus hurt a friend for whom I care deeply, and I think I just feel confused and want to feel comforted. All this to say - I found myself strongly tempted to engage in this sin. I’ve heard sin described as, “God I don’t care what you want. I want what I want.” I essentially was going to do this with complete disregard to God and this knowledge. Now I am trying to figure out - Why? Why am I trying to use this sin as a pacifier for my wounds? Why am I doing this after knowing so much? (I feel so irresponsible.)

Dating a non-denominational protestant while also rediscovering Catholicism,Catholicism,"Hello everyone! I've been dating a girl now for almost 6 months and she is a non denominational Protestant (basically just goes to the generic Christian churches for her services). I myself was born and raised Catholic. In my mid teen years, I started to fall away from the faith. In my late teenage years and early twenties, I wanted nothing to do with religion because I saw no use to it and no benefit to myself (quite selfish and ignorant of me). Now here I am in my mid twenties, I met a girl who challenged me by asking what I believed in. I told her I didn't really know, but I would find out. Now, here I am 6 months later. I play piano for multiple Catholic Churches so I never truly left the Catholic faith, I at least still saw it every Sunday. A new priest came to one of the churches I play for and I was immediately drawn to his overall intelligence about the Catholic faith. Between my girlfriend with her challenge and this new priest, I began to rediscover Catholicism. I have a long ways to go, but I am dedicated to finding the truth. Here's my conundrum... My girlfriend has many misconceptions about Catholicism, doesn't believe it matters what church you belong to so long as you have a personal relationship with God, sees the early church stemming from Christ as a bush with many churches rather than a tree with one true church at the center, and is on the verge of calling off our whole relationship because we cannot come to any real agreements on matters of faith. It is incredibly discouraging and disheartening to have religion as the stumbling block that will not allow our relationship to grow deeper. This is because she is convinced we will never agree and that we will just break up sooner or later. I really care about this woman. Unfortunately, I feel as if I have put in tremendous effort and work for little progress. I continue to actively learn and pursue the Catholic faith not just for myself, but for our own relationship. Now I sit here wondering if it is better to break up and focus completely on my faith and my own growth as an individual. Please feel free to ask for more details! Sorry for the long post, this has been eating away at me for sometime now and I could use some feedback from a trusted resource! ",ab8d4n,self.Catholicism,,True

How to cultivate love like Mother Teresa?,Catholicism,"I have been reading lately a number of saints who implore people to do things with love, to give love to others in abundance. It has made me increasingly aware that while I have spent the last two years working to grow in faith and charity, I typically feel bankrupt in the “love” department. I have to will myself to work charity against my slothful or selfish nature and the strides I have made there are mostly that I make it out each week and show up for the work, or show up for mass each week. I set the bar for myself low intentionally since I’ve made a lot of changes this past year: joining RCIA, studying ethics, doing weekly volunteer work, etc...so the goal was to just KEEP SHOWING UP even when internally my brain is like “NNOOOOOOOOO” but as I go into 2019 I really want to focus on reorienting my will so that I WANT to do these things and also so that I can feel capable of love for other people besides my close family. One critical thing that has not changed much from my former secular life is that I don’t much like other people (hugging, touching, personal conversations). I had an abusive childhood (even though I’m now a recovered adult) so I am very physically withdrawn and tend not to feel anything for strangers. I’m very empathetic in that I will cry over tragic news stories about others but if I am in a room with someone who is suffering I can barely reach out my hand to them, let alone feel love for them or offer that love to them. This is something I REALLY want to change. With regards to my faith it is the predominate part of me that makes my faith feel fraudulent, this absence of real love, even for God. My faith is largely an intellectual assent rather than an outpouring from my heart. So if you have read anything good that discusses how to cultivate this or have advice of your own I would love to hear it!",aa3byx,self.Catholicism,,True
Are organisations of laypeople openly calling for 'reform' while making heretical statements common?,Catholicism,"I'm a lapsed Catholic who has been learning a lot about the faith over the past one and a half years. I'm considering returning to the Church. My grandmother is a life-long Catholic who was the one that took me to mass when I was a kid and arranged for my confirmation. She knows about my interest in returning to the Church. She's been giving me Church newsletters and so on. Last time I saw her, she gave me a three page document written by an organisation made up of Catholic lay people, apparently founded by a former seminarian. I won't name it, obviously. In the document, they were calling for 'church reform'. As I said, I've been learning about the faith for some time now, so I'm familiar with church teaching and doctrine. This document called for many changes in the church that the church and the people in this sub, whose views I am familiar at with this point, would consider seriously heretical. Calling for female ordination, gay marriage and contraception to be allowed, saying the teachings on premarital sex should change, contraception to be changed, as well as statements denying the assumption of Mary and the virgin birth. There was also a frankly xenophobic statement suggesting that foreign priests, of whom there are many in my country, are too traditional and come from misogynistic cultures. A few weeks ago I met with a priest who had come to my country from India to ask him some questions I couldn't find the answers to online, and he was great, everything he said was very orthodox and he even had some very wise musings of his own- I find the suggestion that he's inferior to a local priest just because he adheres to his religion's teachings pretty offensive. In general, the arguments they used were really shoddy and illogical. I won't go into all of them for the sake of brevity and not revealing too much about the organisation but just know that I, a non-practicing Catholic, could demolish them in two seconds. Is this kind of 'organisation' common? As far as I know, no active clergy is involved, but they seem to have a lot of members and my grandma is considering joining them. Is this something I'll encounter a lot if I return?",a9o4nb,self.Catholicism,,True
Breakup Advice / Resources on the Eucharist,Catholicism,"Hey y'all. I feel sort of pathetic posting this. Does anyone have any advice for getting through a breakup? I'm sad to admit I'm a 30-year-old female trying to get over a brief but (emotionally and physically) intense relationship that was unchaste. The worst part is, I had made so much progress in pursuing chastity, holding myself to high standards, etc. ... and then the devil let old habits creep into my life and totally mess me up. I feel broken, bereft, hopeless, and totally consumed in pain. &#x200B; Anyone have any advice for dealing with this? I've been thinking that if I can meditate on the mystical reality of the Eucharist more, I can come to a deeper understanding of the fact that all of my emotional, physical, and spiritual needs are met by Jesus (which will hopefully give me peace and prevent me from seeking to meet my needs in other ways). Does anyone know of any good resources of deepening one's understanding of the mystical realities of the Eucharist? Books? YouTube videos? (this is an odd request, I realize that. lol) &#x200B; Also does anyone have anything they want me to pray for? I am in a lot of pain and I'm going to offer up my pain for your intentions. So far I've been offering up my pain for those struggling with SSA and for a local family who lost their daughter a few weeks ago.

I just want to get back to feeling God's love (which has been replaced by pain and torment at the moment) and I'm grasping at straws. &#x200B; P.S. it seems ironic that today is the anniversary of Fulton Sheen's death.

Was this a near occasion of sin?,Catholicism,"I know that usually when I go on Youtube for too long at some point I'll stumble over something that gives me a weird feeling (in a sexual way).

Since the 'Virgin Birth' is a MAJOR pillar of the faith, how than can it be justified when the original word 'Almah' (which is in the original text and later translated to 'virgin') doesn't necessarily mean virgin? It's the same word they used for 'young women' and 'women of birthing age' That seems to be a rather large leap given that among the two possibilities, a woman of child bearing age having a child is far more likely than a virgin having a baby.

Attended Mass today for the first time in 7 years.,Catholicism,"Was raised Protestant (Lutheran, specifically) but grew up with a devout Catholic grandmother on my mom’s side. We were very close, and her sudden death 7 years ago this week tore me to pieces. She used to take me to Mass and let me accompany her on trips to taking the Eucharist to the sick, the homebound, and parishoners in the local nursing homes. Thus, despite being in a strict fundamental Baptist school and attending Lutheran churches, Catholicism always appealed to me with the way my nana displayed her faith, prayed her rosary every day, and showed compassion in her community. She was a much better Christian role model for me than any other pastor or church member I knew in my Baptist school or Lutheran church. Since she passed away, I have not stepped foot in a Catholic church until today, the Feast of the Holy Family, and I felt right at home. After sitting in too many awful Baptist services and feel-good, TED talk-y Lutheran services, I found the traditional liturgy, the homily, and the overall atmosphere of the Catholic Church to be refreshing and right for me. And after running away from God for so long, I knew this was a call back to His house and to be among His people, and I’m so thankful I took the steps to come home. I’m hoping to bring my mother some day, but I know she has not really moved on from Nana’s passing and may find a Mass to be too sad of a reminder. I will continue attending Mass as oft as I can and maybe even join the parish choir and handbell choir if I decide that this particular church is the one for me.",ab28pu,self.Catholicism,,True
Giants in the Bible,Catholicism,"Hey all. Catholic curious here. I’m wondering what the consensus on giants in the Catholic world is. I left evangelicalism years ago after being raised in a homeschool environment where science was chastised as an evil satanic plot and evolution being a lie from hell. After I looked into it I became very convinced that I was being lied to. Now I find it very hard to believe that the OT stories were literal history and since scientist haven’t found evidence of giant people existing ever, I would assume the onus is on the Christians to prove of Goliath and giants and Noah’s flood and etc. I don’t believe these things really happened but instead understand them to be Bronze Age myths that united tribes much like tales of Odin and Loki uniting the Nordic peoples. Do Catholics understand the OT to be mostly allegory, metaphor, and myth? Are there Catholics who argue for this and is it up for debate in Catholicism? It seems that the Baptist’s that raises me think that you have to believe that the World is 6000 years old and if you don’t believe it, than you are one of those liberals who teach in colleges and bound for the eternal cosmic microwave.

I returned to my faith after a long battle with questioning. I reached out to my ex and she shot me down.,Catholicism,"I was born and baptized Catholic. But ever since late high school I questioned a lot about my religion and ultimately began to fall in and out of it. My girlfriend and I got together my senior of high school. Pretty much at the time when I was on the cusp of abandoning my faith and she was only growing closer to hers. For the most part, though, we had a happy and healthy relationship. The only time we fought was over religion. We stuck it out for 5 years. We broke up in February after talks over abstinence, NFP, children and marriage created some tension between us. I fought her tooth and nail over everything just because I was scared to commit to anything. It's been 10 months and I love her no less than the day we broke up. A couple of weeks ago I started to let God back into my life after a few months of toying with my thoughts. And then I had this turning point. I gave it all up to Him. I let Him have full control and I started to study my faith again. I went to confession for the first time in 7 years, received communion for the first time over a year (I was in and out of going to church, and yes, I know I shouldn't have received communion with mortal sins), and I started to dive into the things that drove me and my girlfriend apart. We were supposed to have a life together. I knew it was supposed to be her. I knew it was sudden, and I knew it was a long shot, but I needed to reach back out to her and tell her I wanted her back before I lost my chance. Not to do things my way this time, though... But to do things HIS way. The way it should be done. I wanted to stop fighting her and open my heart and mind to her ideas. I promise I wasn't a bad boyfriend, but I was stubborn at times. So I poured my heart out to her. She shot me down. She told me no. She had this uneasy feeling that wouldn't clear for her. This was after a couple of days to herself to just let her think and pray with no influence from me. I did this to her... I introduced doubt to her about my faith and my heart breaks for doing that to us. It's my fault. I've never felt so distraught. It's like someone died, but it's worse because I know she's still out there. But I feel like I'm being tested. This was sudden. And I'd be lying if I said that thoughts of her didn't help to spur this reentry into Catholicism. But maybe she was afraid that I was only doing it for her and not for myself. So maybe this is my test... To make sure that it's for me. It's tempting, honestly, to just go back to my old ways and say, 'Forget it, this is all for nothing.' But I'm not done yet. I got my answer from her. Now it's time to show God that I'm here for Him. I know that in comparison to a lot of people's trials, this seems trivial... But it's a big one for me. I want this to be real this time. I want to love God and walk with Him, to explore the mysteries of our faith and to have unfailing belief in Him, no matter what the 'risk' or the 'reward'. I just want this for myself and for God. I needed some way to get this all out and I appreciate all of you who stopped to listen. I love you all and have you in my prayers.

St. Aquinas and the Divine Right of Kings,Catholicism,"The Church teaches that there exists a Divine Right of Kings (ie that all people in positions of power receive their authority from God alone), yet in St. Aquinas's letter to the King of Cyprus, he states that King's power should be restricted in some way so as to make sure that he doesn't become a tyrant. These positions are at odds with one another. If a King's authority comes from God, then he is answerable to God and his power is absolute, but if we go by St. Aquinas and say that King's power should be limited, then how does that fit with the teaching of the Divine Right? What are you guys's thoughts on this?",a6il58,self.Catholicism,,True

I'm afraid I'm doing a terrible thing by not having a mass with the body before cremating my father,Catholicism,"I don't really think Catholicism and Christianity in general seem logically reasonable or supported by solid evidence. But apparently I lack absolute faith that they are false. I know my father wants cremation, but he never expressed interest in a religious service. He was brought up Catholic, but the last time he attended Mass was a long time ago, possibly in 2003. I looked at information and pricing for a funeral service with a viewing followed by going to church, and also considered a bit less expensive alternatives involving a priest coming to the funeral home chapel. Although affordable it seemed like a waste of money plus very very sad because very few people were expected to attend. We'd probably even have to pay pallbearers. A bunch of times my father said there is no 'magic' in religion. That makes sense. I understand it as meaning that it's not like a priest performs some ritual and that changes something magically, like changing the fate of the departed. Perhaps the only real purpose of it is the effects it has on the participants, improving their feelings, intentions and behaviour. So I'm not saying religion is useless, but I am suggesting effects which seem to only be psychological. Considering my father's attitude toward money and other things he said, I think I'm being reasonably true to his will. But, when I thought about telling his relatives in Croatia, whom I don't know well, I was really scared that they would be upset about this. I don't even know if they are Catholic now, even though at least the older generation was brought up Catholic. Trying to work on this fear I realized that the issue is that if they complain I couldn't conclusively say that they are wrong. Maybe I am doing a bad thing here? That's why the fear of their negative reaction was such an obstacle preventing talking to them now. I don't know what I'm expecting here with this post. My situation is weird because after rejecting Catholicism and Christianity as not making sense, I was drawn back toward it when I tried to start a gay relationship and bad things happened. The bad things are partially explainable by psychology, but I'm not sure it's all explainable that way. It led me to interpret things in religious ways relating to Christianity, but in a way that people would call crazy or psychosis. I've never really seriously believed Christianity in an apparently sane state. So, that's quite a dilemma. Hoping to help me cope with this and call relatives, I smoked cannabis and did nitrous oxide hoping to overcome the fear that was blocking me. Instead I had some interesting visions which were showing how heterosexual relationships can be better because females have some elements of existence I don't have because I'm male (like the feminine way of amusedly laughing), and bringing more positive elements of existence into a relationship makes the relationship more good potentially. I've never thought about heterosexuality vs. homosexuality this way. It's not like this is saying homosexuality is something terrible or saying anything about God; it is only showing that heterosexuality can be better. So maybe this is some kind of moral intuition about my doubts about both homosexuality and what I'm doing with my father's body? I don't know, because I'm not sure I can tell the difference between irrational concerns programmed by upbringing and correct intuitive guidance. Maybe it's not so bad though. Maybe this option is suboptimal but not catastrophic. What difference can it make anyways supposedly, duration of time in purgatory, not heaven vs. hell? I did ask for 'last rites' at the hospital and he did get Annointing of the Sick on the day he died. I do intend to send his ashes to the village where he was born in Croatia, to be interred in the cemetery there. I would love to fly them there myself and attend Mass at the village church if possible actually, but I'm not sure it is possible because I need to take care of my mother in Canada. I'm a bit afraid they'll reject ashes because there was no mass with the body. I do think that participants matter in a Mass. I mean, if anything special is happening it is because of all the people together with the Priest leading them, not just the priest doing it on their own. Maybe Mass with a few people just isn't that important and it's better to have one with various relatives in his village. I'm not even sure that the Mass here wouldn't be disrupted with my mother there because of her psychological condition. Actually after typing all this out I feel better, thinking that while what I'm doing may be bad it's not terrible. But I would like some more perspectives before I feel okay about calling his relatives and telling them about my decision.",a3hxgd,self.Catholicism,,True

Three or four types of sins according to Catholicism?,Catholicism,"Four of it... I mean five.

"I put together a list of simple, meaningful ways to give charity to people in their homes (people who are sick, injured, depressed, grieving, new parents, exhausted parents of toddlers, people 'stuck in a rut,' Catholic or non-Catholic).",Catholicism,"Sometimes life can get a bit out hand. Sometimes people are so busy that taking care of themselves or their house slips through the cracks. Sometimes people are sick and physically can't. Sometimes mental illness creeps in and basic care seems too exhausting. Sometimes people have babies. This is an incomplete list of ways to help people. Also, they might not all be appropriate for the situation. Tell the person or family that you're doing this for them, they don't need to lift a finger, and you expect nothing in return. If they can help out and want to help out, sure. But don't make them. If they need to sleep while you clean, or they feel like just sitting while you organize, let them do that. This isn't a list of ways to help 'fix,' people or inspire them to get off their butts. This is a list of ways to help people who need help. * Clean their house. * But where to start cleaning?? It's so messy! * Wash and dry the dishes in the sink, if any. If you know where to put them away, do so. If not, a neat stack of clean dishes is still better than a dirty sink. * Do the laundry in the laundry hamper or on the floor. If you are an adult, you should know how to do laundry. If you have a question about how to wash what, you can look it up on the internet. * If the person can get out of bed for a while, wash the sheets and pillowcases. Sheets get gross *fast* and also, crisp, clean sheets can feel so refreshing! * Check the mail and organize mail. * Take care of pet areas, if pet waste has piled up or the pet has been a messy eater. Is scooping a cat box or cleaning a dog's poop area kind of gross? Yes. Is it something that needs to get done anyway? Yes. * Clean up clutter. If you don't know where it goes, you can put areas of junk into labelled shoeboxes or Ziplock like 'Bedside table stuff, 12-04-18,' 'Countertop papers and books, 12-04-18.' * Take the trash out. Check all the trashcans in the house, even bathroom ones. Follow their home or apartment's recycling protocols. If you're sorting through things with the person, or you have permission to use your best judgment on stuff, just keep taking new bags. * Check the bathroom for empty shampoo bottles and other containers. Some people (me!) let these pile up forever and never get rid of them. Rinse and recycle or toss as appropriate. * Check the fridge and pantry for expired or rotten food. Rinse and recycle containers or toss as appropriate. * Prepare food * Figure out if they have food that you can cook a real meal from. If they don't, purchase a few simple items to give to them. * Figure out what kind of food they like and can eat (check for allergies, religious restrictions, preferences, etc.) * Make a healthy meal for them that they can eat hot whenever you finish it. * Make healthy meals for them that they can reheat for themselves. Write out the reheating instructions, even if they seem obvious, in easy-to-read writing and post it somewhere in the kitchen. * Make and store a big batch of healthy-ish (read: not pizza) staples for them that they can add other things to. I'd recommend a big pot of rice, a big pot of beans, and a big pot of pasta. * Re-organize a small amount of shelf- or counter-space so easy-meals are easy to grab. Put a box of rice, a box of pasta, salt and pepper in their own little non-crowded area. Put a jar of pasta sauce, butter, and any pre-made meals in the front of the fridge. * Chop and store vegetables and fruits that you can eat raw. * Write out instructions for simple meals, even if they seem obvious, in easy-to-read handwriting and post in the kitchen. Illness, depression, sleep deprivation, or loss can make you forget easy things. * If you have the time or ingredients, make a favorite meal. * Errands * Go to the pharmacy for them * Ask for a grocery list and go grocery shopping for them. Do their regular weekly shopping if they need it. Do their 'emergency, we've got nothing,' shopping if they need it. If you have no idea what to buy, I'm a big fan of rice, beans, pasta, pasta sauce, coffee, milk/creamer, bread and peanut butter, carrots, frozen veggies, apples, string cheese, and hot dogs. * Pick up or drop off children from activities, if safe and possible. * Take a pet to the groomer. * Clean out their car, if messy. Vacuum up crumbs and take it through a car wash. * Run any other errands that you can for them. * Companionship * Determine if they need to care care of hygiene, and encourage or help them as appropriate. Try to ensure that they've showered or bathed, brushed their teeth, brushed or combed their hair, have clean and trimmed fingernails, and have clean clothes, especially underwear and socks. * Offer to pray with them. If they don't take you up on this offer, don't insist or do it passive-aggressively-- pray for them privately later. * Sit and talk with them, if they want to talk. Don't offer advice unless they ask for advice. Don't monopolize conversation if they're eager to talk. Try to avoid judging. * Sit with them and talk, if they don't want to talk but they do want to listen. Tell a story, real or fictional. Talk about a school subject or other topic you found interesting. Tell the story of your grandparents' lives. Just...talk if it soothes them. * Sit in silence with them, if that's what they want. Don't look at your phone or insist on making conversation. Just be. If you're bored, but they still want or need you there, pray silently or do whatever else you do when you're bored (I conjugate French verbs in every tense I know them in) * Play cards or a board game with them. Cards are easy when someone is bed-ridden. * Do a jigsaw puzzle with them. * Knit, crochet, whittle, or whatever-they-do with them. If you don't know how to do it, you can just sit by, or ask them to teach you. They might find it comforting to teach you, or they might not. Do what they want. * **Let them sleep if they need sleep.** Whatever situation they're in, whatever you're doing, do not make them stay awake with you. You can clean, make meals, run errands, etc. while they sleep. * Take care of other family members or pets, if safe and possible. This applies mostly to babies. If mom and dad need to sleep, or get out of the house for a couple hours, just take that baby from them. Establish a plan of how to feed baby if necessary (formula, pumped milk, or wake up mom, etc.).",a3p161,self.Catholicism,,True

Afraid to tell my Evangelical parents about my desire to convert...,Catholicism,"Background: I'm in my late 20s, married, and have a fabulous 2-year-old son. My boy is the first and (so far) only grandchild on both sides. I was raised Protestant (C&MA), and I and my family have been more-or-less devout Christians since I was born. I believed (and argued for) all the typical anti-catholic BS up until about a year ago. Then I started reading history and the church fathers and, well, you know how it goes. Mom and Dad are currently Baptists, and Dad's a part-time preacher, teacher, and musician at their church. Earlier in my journey, as I was becoming more 'tolerant' of the rest of Christendom, I tried to play 'devil's advocate' for Catholicism and Orthodoxy with my parents -- mostly centered around the communion of the saints, the sacraments, apostolic succession, etc. It went \*very badly\*. Here's the real kicker, and why I'm posting a new thread when there are already so many just like it: it gave my mother suicidal ideations. Yep. I wasn't even talking about conversion at that point, I was just trying to understand and defend other people's beliefs as 'passable.' And as if the apostatizing of their son wasn't enough on its own, the pressure's \*really\* on because, like I said, my wife and I are at a crossroads with how the grandboy will be raised and indoctrinated. So, time went on, and we joined an Anglican (ACNA) parish on the Anglo-Catholic end of the spectrum. This was a diplomatically acceptable move, and didn't trigger my parents much at all. I can hide behind the notion that we're 'still Protestant,' despite the fact that, on the inside, I'm a total papalist at this point. (Not 100% convinced on a select few non-dogmatic teachings, but I buy all the dogma, at least as understood through an Eastern Catholic spiritual lens.) We're having the kid baptized on the feast of the Baptism of the Lord in a few weeks, and Mom and Dad are coming, so that'll be interesting... But yyyyeeeeaahhh.... if it were simply a matter of risking ostracization or damaging family relationships, I mean, the answer is 'take up your cross and follow me,' but... I'm worried about my mom. I hate being stuck in wannabe Anglo-Catholic limbo, but it's better than being responsible for your own mother hurting herself. I hope she wouldn't actually, but she's not the most stable person mentally and does has a history of these kinds of ideations... I have to believe that her relationship with the Lord would be strong enough to overcome that, but I'm still really apprehensive. Any advice, prayers, divine interventions, etc., would be appreciated. We have some excellent Catholic friends who have been very supportive, but they're at a loss on this one too. EDIT: I'll add that our relationship with my parents is really strong. We live 10 minutes apart, they're very involved in taking care of our kid and we spend a lot of time with them. They're also very very staunch in their beliefs and are highly anti-catholic. EDIT2: Well we had the baptism, and they came, and I could only describe their reactions as 'mostly sheepish.' They participated with most of the liturgy, but I was sitting next to Dad and I could hear him drop out at certain points (I think he omitted anything pertaining to consuming the body and blood of Christ, for example.) At coffee hour they talked to a few parishioners. Afterwards we had lunch and essentially avoided the topic, and while there has been no overt criticism, I could tell they were troubled. And yet, it hasn't changed our relationship so far, and we're still friendly and cordial. Progress maybe?",a92vyr,self.Catholicism,,True

Question on Original Sin (Eastern Orthodox),Catholicism,"Greetings, &#x200B; I am an Eastern Orthodox catechumen. I am confused about the Catholic view on original sin, and I would really appreciate your help. I recently came across an old copy of *Life in Christ: Instructions in the Catholic Faith* by *James Killgallon* and *Gerard Weber* in a second-hand bookstore. In the chapter on the creation of man, it reads: 'Because of the sin of Adam we come into the world deprived of the divine life and subject to death, sickness and the inclination to sin.' and continues to say that 'Original sin... must not be confused with actual or personal sin', which, to me, seems indistinguishable from the Orthodox view on the matter. *The Catechism of the Catholic Church* similarly states that 'original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted'. &#x200B; I had previously thought that the Catholic understanding of original sin held that all humans were guilty of the original sin. According to the Orthodox teaching, we do not bear the guilt of the original sin, but we do bear its consequences. What I read in the texts I mentioned actually do not appear to be different in that regard. Is it the right way, for Catholics, to think about the original sin? If so, how do St. Augustine's teachings harmonise with it? &#x200B; I don't come from a Christian background, and therefore, I am not particularly well equipped to navigate through discussions involving other churches. I am really curious to hear your views. &#x200B; God bless, &#x200B;",a2ty95,self.Catholicism,,True
Feeling immense fear over a sudden shift in faith,Catholicism,"So I've been praying the rosary regularly(not everyday though) for the last couple of weeks and it feels like my own relationship with God and Jesus has just increased ten fold. It's so amazing how something as simple as the rosary has given me so much insight and love for God, something I've experienced more in this last month than I have in my whole existence. Anyway I've been reading up about the accounts of saints and how they lived their lives and I found out that many of the most holy and highly regarded saints within the church prayed the rosary three times a day! I hadn't even been praying it daily yet and I've already experienced such tremendous graces that I thought I may as well try these out for a week and see where it goes. So anyway I managed to squeeze in two rosaries yesterdays, felt comfortable and not forced but as you know the process of praying is long and I don't want it to feel like a chore and my tiredness got the best of me so I went to sleep. I was then awoken this morning, at about 3am with the strongest desire and voice in my head telling me to pray the rosary, so I decide to get up to go get some water and before I knew it I lit my candle and had my rosary in hand. Now the weird part. I felt extremely uncomfortable in that moment. Something in my heart felt a genuine fear of the rosary, of the level of faith it both requires and brings. From being a casual Catholic to having it on my mind all day and now being awoken in the middle of the night to pray it. I felt scared. Genuine anxiety and my heart was racing like crazy. Maybe I'm not ready to take on such an immense level of faith but I never thought that something that seemed like it was becoming part of me and was becoming my refuge from the world would scare me like that. Just as I thought I was about to pass out I told God that I was uncomfortable and asked for my anxieties and fears to be laid to rest. I left the room quickly and got another glass of water, now shaking but starting to calm down I managed to get back and pray a very peaceful and gentle rosary, just as I hoped for. Does anybody know what might have caused that? Would Satan target me for having a devotion to our lady or was I just over thinking everything? ",aajgj1,self.Catholicism,,True

Need SSA Advice - Continuous Journey,Catholicism,"First of all, I wish you all a Merry Christmas. I watched It's a Wonderful Life last night and had a good cry of joy, went to Christmas mass today. About two weeks ago I made a post about my  . Almost five months in and no relapse and faith is stronger than ever. I pray the Rosary everyday. Five month away from my Baptism and first confession. I am planning to confess everything to the priest. Thanks to the anonymity of the internet here goes: Currently 27, Had my first SSA encounter at 24. 24-27 I lived that life style for 2 and half year (I was very lonely, I wish I had stopped sooner). Without getting into details, I tallied up the body count to 21 (Not all the way with everyone, large majority was mutual massages, sinful none the less). Always remained safe and used protection and full checkups at 3 months interval. Something did change this year and just don't want to engage anymore. Do I fantasize? Yes sometimes but not as much compared to up until I started RCIA. Never been with a girl. I observe The family structure in church during mass and straight couples when out. There have never been a male role model in my life. Dad was absent till early teens (raised by mother and aunt) and elder brother is very self centered. I want to have a family and kids, but I have difficulty seeing myself in 'that guy's' place (lack of confidence overall). That guy is grounded and centered. Subtle yet very effective in his role. Following is my list of questions: a) Is this even a possibility for me? Is my sin too Mortal that there is no way of receiving the kind of grace (Straight family man) I want. b) If no for (a) then what is my ideal future outlook? If Yes, then how do I become that guy? Will it be life of a lie? I am committed and feel like I could be a great testimony If I do succeed. May be I can guide other souls in future. I would really appreciate some father figure guidance. Were you ever in this place in your life where I am today? How did you move forward? If you don't want to discuss in a public forum, then please free to PM me. I do feel like talking it through to a spiritual counselor? Any links? The one's I've come accorss near me in Vancouver for SSA seem more like ' PC enablers' due to current social propaganda. I want someone conservative who will tell me it's a sin and a way out of it. &#x200B;",a9km7p,self.Catholicism,,True
I'm new to learning about Natural Family Planning (NFP) and I would like your insights into what constitutes a selfish reasoning for avoiding pregnancy.,Catholicism,"So a little background into why I'm asking this. 10 months ago, my girlfriend of almost 5 years and I broke up. Mostly due to preferences concerning our religion. While we are both technically Catholic, I definitely wasn't practicing. She, on the other hand, was growing closer every day. We had a sexual relationship, but had never had sex. To this day, though we are not together anymore, we both are still virgins. She developed the idea that she didn't want to pursue a sexual relationship anymore. She had already wanted to wait until marriage for sex, but wanted to stop everything else until then too. Additionally, she wanted to practice NFP. I found all of this overwhelming at the time. I enjoyed what we had going, and wanted to keep doing it. I'm also terrified of having children so NFP was incredibly scary for me to think about. There were also several selfish reasons I wanted to keep doing what we were doing and not practice NFP. 10 months later I'm much stronger in my faith now, and I decided to revisit those reasons of why we broke up. And actually take a vested interest in learning about them. And I must say... I was grossly misinformed in NFP and have a very different take on it now. It's actually much more appealing to me. To get to the point though, I understand that you should only avoid pregnancy with justifiable reason. Health, financial situation, etc. That makes plenty of sense. But what about the idea of just not feeling ready to have a child? Nothing particularly stops you in life from having them, but you just feel that you aren't in a state where you feel comfortable enough to have a child yet. Not even for something like, 'I still want to go travelling, and buy nice things, and this and that.' No, you just simply don't feel ready. Is something like that okay to choose avoiding pregnancy with NFP? What other reasons seem like they ride a thin line for avoidance? Thanks for your inputs!",a7phxh,self.Catholicism,,True
Can demons influence dreams?,Catholicism,"Hello all! I feel a bit embarrassed asking this question as I tend to put a rational explaination to anything strange that happens. I've made a few posts before about how I made an inquiry and started attending RCIA classes, even received a rosary that had been blessed by the parish priest and have been learning to pray it. Last night's dream left me perplexed and a tad bit disturbed to say the least. In it I was talking to my father about my journey into Catholicism ( which in RL he knows and doesn't mind ) while talking he frowns and tells me he is actually a Satanist. Cofused I reply asking him 'Atheistic?' He smiles and says no that he actually believes Satan exists. He then goes on talking bad about God and the church and I get into a debate about how good Christ is and the good things the church has done. He seems to get angrier over the course of the discussion before an extremely loud outburst exclaiming ' This is why I hate Christ! He's trying to take you away from me! ' At this point his face had looked as if it was melting and was morphing into something horrific. I immediately awoke from shock. I don't put stock in dreams as I have had weird ones before but this one had left an impact on me. Especially due to it being my own father making these weird and awful remarks. Let me state that my relationship with my dad is good and he supports whatever I decided to do; he's even attending my RCIA's family get together this month. I wanted to ask about this in my class but I frankly feel embarrassed being distraught over a simple dream. ",a2udty,self.Catholicism,,True
If I became Catholic would they baptise me?,Catholicism,"Forgive me because I have no idea how this works. I did not grow up Christian and so I've never been baptised, not as a baby and not as an adult. I became a Christian when I was 13 and now I'm almost 19 but I still have not been baptised! It bothers me a lot. I almost did when I was 15 ( at a Baptist church) but since I needed parental permission and I was too afraid to ask them I didn't. The Baptist church I go to (but I'd never become a member of, they're super Calvinist) doesn't do baptisms very often. So I just never have. Lately, I have been researching Catholicism, I have soo many questions and I don't know if I will become Catholic. I feel like there's a chance I might but I'm scared I'm being deceived/gullible.

The works of mercy; admonishing sinners,Catholicism,Basically I understand that if people are doing something that is objectively gravely wrong (not discussing subjective culpability here. I'm mostly worried about very common stuff like saying omg) we have to tell them under pain of mortal sin. It's just that I feel like it's hard to tell whether the person will only get offended at the comment and I'll come off as the stereotypical street preacher and turn that person away from Christianity. Furthermore sometimes I see people who are my superiors do things and I don't want to say something out of a mixture of the reason I've said before and fear and not wanting to be disrespectful.

A change of mind and a change of heart.,Catholicism,"On the latest episode of the Matt Fradd show, they were discussing the plight of someone who was discerning the priesthood, while being addicted to pornography, and Matt said something that has stuck with me.

I just about started to cry. I thought to myself, “Oh Lord, what I would not give for that! What I would not give to be freed from the chains of habitual sin, freed from this seemingly inescapable prison of my own mind, freed from the overwhelming desire to indulge my baser appetites, freed from the warped perception that sees the female body as merely an object of man’s pleasure rather than the beautiful creation that God intended it to be!” I would like to ask those who have overcome this, those who have come to the other side of this addiction, what did you do to make that change?

Parish in Los Angeles,Catholicism,"Hi all, I've tried to look at the previous similar questions but couldn't satisfy myself with it. I'm quite a trad about liturgy so i prefer candle, organ, incense, basically a very 'high' church. I live in the west side and at some point I had been attending St. Victor's 7:30 EF mass but unfortunately they moved out to east LA which is quite far from my place.

An argument or the Cassock,Catholicism,"I have seen throughout this year (and also years prior) that most clergy refuse to wear their cassocks and more and more religious \[women\] tend to ditch their habits-- why is that? My thoughts lead me to believe two things: 1. that the clergy see their cassocks and think it's some how elitist, arrogant, and a way of 'clinging to the past'. And 2. that they're ashamed of their priestly roles. I'm sure number 2 is true for some one out there, but number 1 is more probable. Especially within the 'baby boomer' generation. It seems that out of this generation we saw a rise in faux simplicity. Where ugliness started to be seen as simple, pious, and humble. It is from this that we could start to see a rise in resentment towards the vestments of the clergy-- more in particular-- the cassock. But here's the thing-- the cassock is not a symbol of \[true\] clericalism . In fact it is a sign of obedience to God and his Church; especially when the roman collar is used. The cassock itself is a uniform just like that of a butler, or policeman, or firefighter. In truth the cassock compliments the priest as he is a servant of God who tends to God's people. Couple that with the roman collar, and you see a deep level of servitude as the collar is something placed on a slave, a servant. What do you think?",aahlem,self.Catholicism,,True

"Ok, very close to converting to Catholicism. I just need a bit more clarification.",Catholicism,"I’m going through verses in the New Testament about the church, its unity and its one truth and gospel. Obviously the churches of today are not united at all. The millions of Protestant churches shows this. Jesus talks only about making one church (Matthew 16:18, John 10:14:16, John 16:12-15, Matthew 18:15-17). This church would be led by Jesus on the Holy Spirit’s behalf into all the truth (John 16:12-15). Furthermore Paul says that anyone who teaches a false gospel (good news, not just Jesus’ death and resurrection) is under God’s curse (Galatians 1:6-10). All the truth includes all doctrinal issues and whatever Jesus has left to say to us that the disciples just weren’t ready for, or in other words the rest of the good news. The different denominations are not a part of this church. Only one “denomination” is -the one Jesus built. Jesus built it ultimately on St. Peter after speaking through the Holy Spirit on behalf of the other apostles (Matthew 16:18-19). This account parallels Isaiah 22:22 in which Eliakim the son of Hilkiah was given the keys to the house of David and had the highest authority other than the king. The keys given to Peter seem to be about forgiving sins letting people into the kingdom or not. Not sure exactly what Eliakim’s keys were, but they must serve a similar function (feel free to explain!). Peter then was given the highest authority in the church and thus when the church risks being not in unity and the gates of Hell prevailing against the Holy Spirit’s guide to the fullness of truth Peter would be given the Holy Spirit to declare infallibly the church’s teaching just like he did in Matthew 16. If Peter didn’t speak rightly in this instance the gates of hell would have prevailed against the church with the foundation of the church dying. Mostly the church will be able to agree through councils like the council of Nicea or the council of Jerusalem in Acts 15. Correct me if I’m wrong. Add extra reasons and arguments on to this if you so desire. In summary, if the church was corrupted with a false doctrine (a false gospel) so much so that the foundation of the church teaches heresy we would be under the curse of God and the gates of Hell will have prevailed. This cannot be as Peter was promised to by Christ that the church would not be prevailed by the gates of Hell. Thus when the church risks slipping away from the Holy Spirit’s guidance and entering the curse of God and the councils cannot decide, the final authority is the Bishop of Rome applying Jesus’ promise to Peter (ex cathedra). However, I still do have questions. Firstly how do we know that Peter was the bishop of Rome? Secondly, what was the line of popes after him? Finally what issues have been infallibly declared by the Pope? ",a74lx2,self.Catholicism,,True
"I am having serious problems with anger, hatred, and grief and I don't know what to do. Any help would be appreciated.",Catholicism,"I have been dealing with my problems for a few months now, but as of now they're worse than ever. I've tried to bottle it up, but it leads to even worse feelings, and the one time I posted online about my problems, in a Christian forum, I was attacked and mocked. This forum seems to be kind and pleasant enough, so I thought I would unload some of my problems here, and see what advice you may have. I know this is probably going to sound very stupid, but here it is. I read a story online where a father forced his 14-year-old daughter to have an abortion, after abusing and isolating her. He bullied and coerced her into an abortion, and the experience was so traumatizing for her she hasn't spoken to him for five months according to the post. He claimed to want to help his daughter and feel sorry for his actions, but he was clearly a narcissist trying to gain support, which he did. Most of his replies were people cheering him on. The story broke my heart. An innocent girl and baby were harmed because of the selfishness of one man. And he was being congratulated for it. I read the post over and over, and I read the comments over and over. Every time, my despair grew, and so did my hatred. I have always had serious anger issues, and a very negative view of the world. But I genuinely believed there was more good than bad, that humanity was worth caring about. But the story continues to haunt me. I will describe my feelings to the best of my ability. I do not fault you if you think I am mentally ill. I am angry most of the time now. I have a seething hatred for 90-95% of humanity (the remainder being the moral people and children). I suffer physical symptoms of my anger, such as trembling, clenched teeth, and stomach pain. I attempt to distract myself with work and hobbies, however, the story is always at the back of my mind. Last night I even had a dream about it, which partially inspired my choice to try to talk to people about this. And finally, as to why I'm posting in a Catholic forum, I want your advice. I cannot shake off my hatred and sadness, no matter how hard I try. I am afraid this is affecting my spiritual life and relationship with the Lord. I will be honest, I truly, 100%, hate most of humanity with a passion, for its evils. I do know there are good and innocent people out there and I spare them my feelings, but that does not change I really hate most people. I have frequent violent fantasies involving torturing and murdering evil people. And this may sound petty, but the fact that the Lord actually offers some people, like the abusive father mentioned above, even a chance at redemption, makes me furious. I know that He knows best, but in my tiny mortal mind I feel like it's completely unfair that evil people will go unpunished for their actions if they repent. I truly believe that many people are simply unworthy of forgiveness, such as murderers, rapists, abusers, etcetera. Even if they were truly sorry, and wanted to atone, they still committed their actions, and they cannot erase them, and therefore cannot be forgiven, and are still evil. Which is why I am in near constant anger. I feel like there is a lack of justice in this world. To be short, I would like to know how I can let go of hate, and anger, and stop remembering bad things over and over again. Thank you for reading. &#x200B;",a8435x,self.Catholicism,,True

She has been a dedicated practicing Catholic for over 60 years from childhood until this year.

Her faith in God is still strong but she has lost faith in her Church’s ability to be a spiritual guide and in priests to be such an important liaison to the Eucharist so she has stopped going to Mass. I would love to get her a bible verse or a necklace with a relevant patron saint that would be relative to her struggle in faith this year or the personal nature to ones relationship with God. I understand and support her decision to leave the Church though I think it would be nice to have something that reminds her that she is not lost without the institution and that it does not negate what is in her heart.",a8jabv,self.Catholicism,,True
I feel pretty confused and tormented spiritually.,Catholicism,"I made a post a couple weeks back about having a powerful but strange confession experience. I cannot stop thinking the confession was valid or invalid, it’s like a continuous barrage in my head and I have no idea who’s who in terms of God or the devil or even myself. A lot of it has to do with violations to the sixth commandment, I had started off by being general with those sins but was about to get specific but by that time I was already shaking and crying and the priest stopped me and just started talking to me for awhile about God’s forgiveness. He absolved me but I just can’t get these thoughts out of my head that I invalidated the sacrament by sins of omission even though he was the one that stopped me. I’ve been praying about this asking God to help me figure out what’s right or wrong about this situation. Am I sinning more because I can’t let go of those sins myself, and doubting His forgiveness or did I make a bad confession? Maybe someone here can cut through the tangles because I am having no luck and I feel like I’m in a Catch 22.",a9tz9x,self.Catholicism,,True

You're not sure if you 'consent' to thinking about it but when you do think about it you keep it in the terms above. It still makes you very sad, it still might even make you cry but you keep your conscious thoughts in the above mentioned spirit. Did you consent to envy or not? Did you nourish it? Did you sin?

For the 25 minutes before Mass, I sat there and just wondered how this could happen. I've been attending the parish in my college town for three semesters, and it has much greater weekly attendance.

Being ashamed of your faith,Catholicism,"I'm a person that gets sensitive and cries often. When that happens I tend to just go pray which means that when I'm sad I pray quite a bit. Also sometimes praying can make me slightly sad in a good way (ie the Sorrowful Mysteries) When she notices I'm sad my Mom (I'm 16) will ask 'What are you thinking about?' or 'What are you doing?' and if the answer if 'Jesus' or 'praying' I don't want to give that answer (since I don't want her to associate my negative emotions with faith) so I just say 'Sorry Mommy, I don't want to answer that question, it's a little private.' &#x200B; Last night I was randomly praying. I was a little sad but not very much so, I don't know if she noticed. She asked me 'What are you/were you thinking of?' (I forgot which) and I simply gave no answer to which she replied 'Oh right, sorry I forgot you don't want to answer to that.' I don't know if I didn't answer because I was embarrassed or because I didn't want to establish a pattern whereby if I'm ok I answer that question and if I'm not ok I don't answer it or out of instinct or a combination or because I felt my thoughts and internal state in general are something I don't want to disclose, even if it is thinking about God. So considering that Jesus said that whoever doesn't acknowledge/is ashamed of Him before men He won't acknowledge before the angels (or something like that) assuming that I didn't answer her question out of some weird embarrassment would that be grave matter?

'Is It A Sin to be Scandalized by Abuse?' by Melinda Selmys,Catholicism,". Text below: Yet again, the Church is being rocked by a clerical abuse scandal. And yet again, I see people repeating the sentiment that “If people’s faith is being destroyed by the actions of men, then their faith was in men and not in God.” Two Sundays ago, sitting in Church, I couldn’t help but think of this when the reading from Jeremiah came up: “Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the Lord. Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the Lord. (Jeremiah 23:1-2) There is a massive divide between these two reactions to pastoral abuse. Spiritual authority comes with a very great weight of personal responsibility precisely because a pastor is charged with caring for souls. We call our priests and bishops “Father” and the Pope “Papa” because they have a genuine obligation to act as spiritual fathers to the souls in their care. Now, let’s say that you encountered a child on the street and you asked him “Why did you run away from home?” and he said “My father was sexually abusing me.” Or a girl in a shelter, “My parents neglected me so badly I had to steal food from the neighbour’s trash bins.” Would you blame these children for having run away? Would you tell them that it was their job not to be driven off by what their parents did to them? God’s response, as told to Jeremiah, is not to blame the scattered sheep. He doesn’t say “Well, they should have stuck it out with the bad shepherds. They should have forgiven them. Or found better shepherds. They shouldn’t have let themselves be scattered.” Instead, He focuses the blame where it belongs: on the abusers. On the shepherds who have done evil. He ascribes the loss of the flock to the bad shepherds who have “driven them away.” Some Christians (including the visiting homilist at my parish) want to be able to turn the passage around, and shift the focus onto the “responsibilities of the sheep,” this is an approach that involves twisting the actual meaning of the passage. When it is employed towards those who are scandalized by abuse, it is an exercise in blame-shifting — not, as I recall, a tactic that impressed God very much the first time it was employed (cf. Gen 3:12-13). To the scattered sheep, Jeremiah addresses no rebuke. Quite the opposite. To them, he gives a promise “I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” (Jeremiah 23:3-4) ",a5ksor,self.Catholicism,,True

I want to join my local Catholic Church.,Catholicism,I am a 24 year old Junior in college and I don't know how to approach this but I want to Join my local Catholic church near my campus but I am not sure how I should go about it. I use to be very liberal and an atheist. The last 2 or 3 years I have developed a different set of morals and have become more conservative. I grew up Christian and both sides of my family and both sides are Baptist. I was scared away from Christianity in my pre-teens because my grandparents on my mothers side were always instilling fear into me and they would bully me . It drove me away and the older I got i became more liberal and ditched my christian values. About two years ago I slowly started to become more conservative again but not religiously. A few weeks ago I had a dream i was in this big church praying and I kept feeling the inner voice in my head telling me to go to the Catholic parish on campus and I have visited 3 times in the past few weeks. I feel amazing when I step foot in and I try to be as respectful as possible. I go during the day when no one is there and I pray to god. I don't know if I am suppose to be doing this if it's against Catholicism but it makes me feel whole on the inside. I want to join this Institution but i'm nervous about asking someone how to do it. I asked my Baptist grandmother on my fathers side(the nice grandma) What she thought about all this and she was curious as to why i felt Catholicism was for me and I told her I wasn't sure but i feel comfortable in this church and I did a little research and it's something I want to go forward with. She told me if my heart is telling me to go then i should. Is there a process into joining the catholic church? I want to attend services but don't want to be rude and kicked out by not doing it properly. It would be awesome if someone could give me some advice and tips.

I also understand that suffering can help bring us closer to God. In times of suffering, many often turn to prayer and religion in hopes of finding some kind of comfort or understanding. But on top of that, it sounds like offering up your suffering is a *specific action*.

Can I receive the Eucharist?,Catholicism,"Today, I had made a confession, but nearing the end of my act of contrition, I realized that I forgot that I had been a bit intoxicated.

I've been told there's a fine line between mortal and venial with drinking. I did drink for the taste, but also to relax, which could mean that I wanted to abuse alcohol to an extent. While I was a little buzzed, I had a little more, and that's it. I'm worried though maybe that I ultimately had intent to be drunk, and that maybe I did commit a mortal sin. Also, given that I was in my act of contrition, would it have been fine to just bring up the sin at my next confession? Or should I have said it right then and there?

This past weekend I (unknowingly) attended an Ordinariate parish for this first time due to convenience, and only after researching found why a few parts of mass were a little different than what I am used to. I have a typical parish that I love attending, but I am wondering if there is any reason that I should not attend the occasional mass at the Ordinariate parish having not converted to Catholicism from Anglicanism? For example, they’re offering a vigil mass this Friday evening after I get off work late, and I will be out in the boonies at least an hour from the closest church until Sunday evening. Is there any reason that I should try to find somewhere else to go? I hope this is not a bad (see: stupid) question, but the church is very convenient and I had an awesome experience going to confession and mass there this past weekend, and would like the option of having it in my back pocket if need be.

naming/describing a sin appropriately in confession,Catholicism,"Hello, I need to go to reconciliation ASAP because I’m fairly sure I’ve committed a mortal sin. But I’m struggling with a) how concisely to name it and b) how to number the times I’ve committed it because it’s been a gradual escalation to this one. The thing is that my S.O. and I have been eroding our own standards of chastity by getting more and more physically intimidate and we finally drew the line and said we need to stop this and pull ourselves together when we got to the point of really hardcore making out. This has been months in the making because of not listening to the little nags in our consciences that were pushing our luck and it culminated in making as much physical contact with your body as you can with clothes on. So my question is: how do you make a good, honest confession without being able to count the incidents and also phrase things as explicitly as necessary but without being improper. For example, I cringe hard at the thought of saying in a church: “I’ve been ignoring my conscience and with my SO and we’ve been escalating things and last weekend we essentially dry humped.” It sounds crass. I’d like to get my head sorted to I can gather my courage and get to confession and daily mass as soon as possible this week, Ive had to stay away from communion for a while and I’m stressing out.

Never had a true female friend before and I'm wondering about emotional chastity,Catholicism,"All my life, any female friends I had were friends either through school/extracurriculars. For the most part, I'd mainly talk about such subjects with them, or I'd be interested in them for a relationship which would make my interactions less authentic. Now, thanks be to God, I've made friends with a girl here in college, with whom I can speak about many things. Lately, however, I think I've become too attached to her. We hang out multiple times a week, but when I'm not with her I can feel very lonely. We message each other quite often, but obviously that's not 24/7, so when I don't interact with her I feel lonely. It's actually been affecting my ability to work. I've been praying a lot about this. I'm actually scared that I'm getting a crush on her, as 1. I actually give her advice on dealing with another guy she likes and who likes her, and 2. she's not Catholic. Lately I've heard about something called emotional chastity. I'm wondering if that applies here. I've been forcing myself to not message her, but when we hang out the time flies and I can mess up my studying schedule a bit, so emotional chastity may be a problem here. Any advice?

Christ only makes sense to me as a Catholic. The Bible provides perfect continuity to me as a Catholic. The Old Testament only agrees in harmony with the New Testament as a Catholic. Am I off base here?,Catholicism,"As much as I’d love to expound on this as a convert, I’m really just wondering if anyone else out there feels the same way I do. I came to know Christ as a Protestant, but felt as though there were so many “Yes! Yes! Yes! Ehhhh...that’s a stretch” moments in my understanding of Scripture. But, since I’ve been given the gift that is the Church, all of those “eh...” contingencies have been turned to “Wow, this is really the ‘completion!’” Catholic theology has gifted me with a much bigger God than I’d ever understood before. I don’t have to apologize or backtrack on any beliefs or topics anymore. I don’t have to say, “yeah, I know my church says X, but I agree that we should probably be saying Y.” I’m a critic, a skeptic, I’m the guy that doesn’t take *anything* at face value, I need **proof!**...especially in regards to religion. But since coming into the Church, I don’t feel like that person anymore. I had plenty of reservations and personal disagreements with the Catholic Church when I was coming into her—some deeply held. But honestly, after the 20th or 30th time she proved herself right, and proved me wrong, I just kind of gave up and released myself to accept her and what she was teaching be about God. I’m Catholic, a Christ follower, and an adherent to the Church’s moral teachings and that extends to how she tells me to integrate those teachings into my life. And God makes more sense to me—more logical to me—than I ever thought was possible before. Does this ring a bell with anyone?",a7jxpk,self.Catholicism,,True

"This Christmas has seen me have something of a faith breakthrough, mostly in thanks to my exploration of Catholicism.",Catholicism,"Back when I was a member in the Baptist church, one major issue I had was reconciling the OT and NT, especially about Jesus as messiah. This was made even stronger by the fact that certainly for the church I was in, the ministers there were less keen on addressing 'difficult' subjects, especially the more 'academic' topics. This was a frustration to me- I wasn't asking for some grand talk on the finer points of the *Summa Theologica* but it would have at least been nice to have some proper meaty theological discussion. This was futhered when I turned to Jewish information, which seemed to be the most logical choice- my rationale at the time was that as it was the Jewish people who awaited the messiah, it would be Jewish scholarly sources which would give me the best understanding about the subject. This only seemed to push me even further away- what most of the (nearly all fairly modern) articles, books and websites seemed to be pointing out was only serving to stoke my already present doubts. I ended up all but walking away from Christianity as a whole, not just because of this issue but others as well, and even seriously considered for a while converting to Orthodox Judaism. Skip forward to more recently and with me looking back at Christianity, and particularly Catholicism, what has particularly been a major revelation for me is that unlike my previous experience with Baptist Christianity, Catholicism seems much more inclined to and even keen for there to be proper faith building and actual discussion and study of theology, even for an 'ordinary' Catholic. Neither is there any attempt to deflect attention away from 'difficult' subjects. With this, I have found that a lot of my previous doubts are being settled in a way which I wish had been obvious to me all that time ago. I actually feel a weight has been lifted from my shoulders and I'm probably more and more enthusiastic to keep going than ever before. Sorry for rambling, I'm just happy. :) ",a9iptp,self.Catholicism,,True
How can I cultivate a better relationship with Mary?,Catholicism,"My very first exposure to Catholicism was a Miraculous Medal my boyfriend (now husband) gave me, and ever since then, I've felt an emotional connection to Mary, even back then when I considered myself agnostic.

Besides getting a new medal, I'm wondering what else I can do to show my love for Mary. I recently started praying the rosary (it's not a habit yet, so I don't always remember to do it every day, but most days) and I do say a quick little prayer to her at least a couple times a week, asking her for help or just talking. I'm never really sure what to say and it can be a little intimidating. I was also thinking maybe this spring I'll buy a garden statue of Mary and devote a little section of my backyard to her.

I placed my hand on the monstrance as he started to pray. And then... I felt the Holy Spirit. I felt him!! I have never experienced anything so exhilarating in my life.

Ever since I was little, every time I go to confession I either have a bad experience, feel like the priest was disappointed in me, or just leave feeling really lousy about myself. It forces me to take things out of my head that I’ve kind of shoved away and face them head on, and it’s uncomfortable and brings to the surface unpleasant emotions to think about these negative things in my life... I’m happier when I ignore them and keep them shoved away. So, how can I find blessing, Joy, and peace from confession?

A plea about receiving the Eucharist in the hand/ on the tongue.,Catholicism,"Although I respect both methods of receiving and have done both depending on what was allowed in the countries I've been in recently I've been considering the fact that I've heard about cases of Eucharistic desecration I think there needs to be a change. The Eucharist is the most precious physical object in the world that is currently in existence (because He isn't just an object but I digress). Any act of desecration is a hugeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee deal. Thus it seems to me that a quick way to prevent abuses is to make receiving on the tongue mandatory. This doesn't necessarily imply kneeling so there isn't any issue with altar rails or anything. I seriously think that if you live in a country where receiving in the hand is allowed you should petition your bishop conference or something to make it something that isn't allowed citing this reason and giving examples of cases in which this has happened. Honestly, I don't consider myself a traditionalist (though that isn't bad) and don't think you need to consider yourself one to thing that this should be implemented with utmost urgency.

Providentialist husband not on board with NFP (to avoid),Catholicism,"Part I: I hope I can explain my situation without writing a novel. Here goes... My husband and I have been married about 3.5 years, and we just joyfully welcomed our second child to our family about 6 weeks ago. We prayerfully discerned together that it was time to start our family when we began using NFP to conceive our daughter (who is 22 months). For a little background, I was surgically diagnosed with Stage II endometriosis in 2014, and the primary symptom for me with this condition is chronic unrelenting pain throughout my entire cycle. I have tried every treatment for this from expert surgery (excision) to multiple forms of hormonal treatment and none have given me any lasting relief. I ecologically breastfed my daughter for her first 9 months of life but had a return of menstruation around 7 months, and conceived our second child at 10 months postpartum. When my cycles returned I had a return of my chronic pain, and it became clear that I'd be facing the prospect of a hysterectomy due to how incapacitating the pain is and how incompatible that is with my responsibilities as a wife and mother. Because of this, we made no attempt to really avoid pregnancy or chart but instead, decided to leave it up to God to send us another if it was His will for us, knowing that if I did fall pregnant it would sort of kick the can down the road so to speak in terms of finding treatment for my pain as it isn't an issue when my cycles are suppressed. We decided that we had no serious reasons to avoid at that time. We also felt no great rush to conceive however, and so truly, at that time, left it entirely in God's hands and were essentially 'providentialist' in our whole approach. We conceived our son during my third cycle PP. I am now six weeks PP, and am of course thinking about the future, and while I am not currently menstruating, I know that this decision is one we will have to make again when my fertility returns. I am planning on getting some more medical opinions about the potential hysterectomy in the coming months, but I realized that for the time being, during this post partum period with my 2 under 2, I feel that as a family we have serious reasons to avoid. I understand that if my pain returns with my fertility in the next 6 months I may have no choice but to move ahead with the hysterectomy even if that means closing the door on future conception. But as it stands I do not feel like I have the physical or emotional or material resources to responsibly bear another child right away and feel that, even with the prospect of hysterectomy looming, using NFP to avoid a third pregnancy is the responsible, loving thing to do. I am thinking about the wellbeing of my current two children here and my ability to be the mom they deserve. I told my husband tonight that I wanted to look into a new NFP method that is better suited to the postpartum period so that we could avoid until we were ready to make a conscious prayerful decision to knowingly seek conception (I do not feel I am ready now, and recognise my hysterectomy may become necessary before we get to the point where I feel like I am). I was surprised (and somewhat hurt) by his reaction. He does not want to use NFP to avoid. He apparently thinks we should again leave it entirely in God's hands as we did with our 2nd, and that abstaining from the marital embrace (or me 'refusing the marriage debt') during fertile parts of my cycle is not something he is on board with.",aaj18w,self.Catholicism,,True

The wrongs I did will never be undone, but at least I want to do this as a proof to God and myself of my repent. Also, I want to pray for my family, damn even for my friends and the world in general.

But especially, I'll pray for those I love and my country. &#x200B; Now, I'd like you to pray for me, even if a slight and quick Hail Mary.

"If the chatolic church dont worship saints, Mary and the pope, why so the church dont correct those who practice it?",Catholicism,"I live on brazil, even though the country is undergoing many changes, it is still a strongly religious and catholic country. I'm a Christian, but I'm not a Catholic, I always heard from Catholics that the practice of worshiping saints was not true but a lie designed to stain the church image.. but here the problem, this is not what I see while observing the daily Catholic practices. what i see is people worshiping saints, mary and the pope, i see people crying under a Saint statue, i see people touching the statue and asking for that specific saint perform miracles for them, I see people making pilgrimages, walking for miles while carrying a statue of a very heavy Santa Maria in the hopes that mary will help them. i never EVER saw a Catholic doing a prayer to God, is always a prayer for a Saint or Mary herself. its common here walk the streets and a person approaches you to deliver a paper with a Catholic prayer, the prayers are varied but they all have something in common, they are prayers to Saints never to God. and there are saints for everything, the Saint of car with defect, the saint of the pregnancy, the Saint of getting you ex boyfriend back.

Was laughing at this joke a sin?,Catholicism,"There was a book with an interview with Pope Francis. My Dad was flipping through a found a joke that he wanted to share with us. It went something like this (rough translation) 'A Jewish boy was doing very badly in all the Jewish schools he'd been to. He had flunked all of his subjects and got kicked out of three schools. Out of desperation his parents decided to send him to a Catholic school. They are surprised to see his grades improve and are getting positive reports from all of the teachers. Mesmerized they ask the school principal what he did in order to bring about this change 'It's quite simple. On the first day we dragged him before a Crucifix and told him 'See, he was also Jewish and he also didn't listen and was naughty and that's what happened to him!'' We all laughed at this joke but I wondered even whilst laughing if I shouldn't laugh or say something or if it was disrespectful to Jesus and if by laughing and not saying anything I committed a mortal sin (at least in terms of it being grave matter). At the same time I thought that maybe by saying something I'd come off as too uptight and besides (since they are not Catholics) maybe it would be good for them to have a good opinion of Pope Francis and think he has a sense of humor. So am I being too uptight? &#x200B; &#x200B; \*Apparently the original was something like 'when he saw it he knew we meant business' but that doesn't translate into my language so maybe the editor translated it weirdly.

A Clean Conscience is not sufficient unto itself.,Catholicism,"From today’s epistle, 1 Corinthians 4:1-5 “Nihil enim mihi conscius sum: sed non in hoc iustificatus sum” 'For I have nothing on my conscience, but in this I am not justified” It’s great that Holy Mother Church gives us such nutritious food to chew upon right before we are to rejoice in the birth of the Word made flesh. Unfortunately, it seems like so many in today’s Church are ignorant of this teaching, i.e. a clean conscience, per se, is not sufficient for salvation and justification for all moral action. if St. Paul isn’t satisfied with simply having a clean conscience, I don’t know who can be. Even Bishop Barron recently seemed to be in support of this new project of making conscience supreme in his latest interview with Ben Shapiro, in which he seems to argue that anyone, even an atheist, can be saved as long as he’s acting in accord with his conscience. (Although, this may be true on some technical level, it leaves out a tremendous amount that needs saying as St. Paul here makes clear.) God willing, he can reflect on this passage and amend his ways. Moreover, God willing, we can learn not to act as if a clean conscience on our part is enough and we can go to Confession and receive the grace of God that truly destroys all sin so that we can truly rejoice at the moment of the Savior's birth.

I burn (a meditation on my deeply flawed singleness) (warning: adult themes),Catholicism,"Hi all - I've been going through a lot, and venting on Reddit to random strangers is my sad little outlet (for now at least. I'll be starting up with an amazing devout Catholic therapist in January, thank the Lord). &#x200B; I struggle with alcohol, promiscuity, and what I've recently come to self-diagnose as a 'sex and love addiction' (SLAA). This materializes as me acting out, getting drunk, having sex with strangers (usually people who are just like me: 'tortured souls' on the inside, attractive, charismatic, and smart on the outside), and then trying to spark relationships with them. When they inevitably kick me to the curb (because no guy wants to be with the gal who slept with him the first night they met), I go insane. Physical illness, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, intense stalking behavior, obsessive thoughts, etc. &#x200B; The saddest part is, I don't have an excuse for being the way that I am. I grew up in a devout, loving Catholic upper middle class family with two loving parents and amazing siblings. &#x200B; Anyways, this doesn't happen on a weekly or even monthly basis, thank God, but when it does happen, it utterly guts me. As you can imagine. Pure devastation and ravage, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. But the behavior has escalated since turning 30 because I feel pressure to be seen as beautiful, to be adored/worshiped by men, and to get married and start a family. &#x200B; Today, as I fight tears, exhaustion, and a stomach ache in the wake of a breakup from one of these shallow 'relationships' (he's leaving for someone more 'tortured' than I am since he finds that 'glamorous'), I decided I need to walk feet-first into the fire. I need to keep repeating to myself the words that are the scariest things to say: *I might never get married. I might be single forever. And that is OK. The goal of my life is to be a ciborium of the Holy Spirit and a conduit of God's love. And as long as I can recover my ability to be those things, that is enough. That is enough.* &#x200B; I have to keep picturing my body as a pillar burning in a fire. I am making of my life of living sacrifice and no one will ever know the complex multi-faceted elements of this odd experience, except for God, and that is enough. &#x200B; Please pray for me y'all.

I’m a struggling Cradle Catholic,Catholicism,Bear with me. This post is going to be probably all over the place. I am 24f. Went to catholic school k-8th grade. In high school I did life teen and loved my faith a lot. Probably after I turned 20 I hit a faith slump. When I was 22 I dated an older guy who pulled me away from my faith and made me even second guess things like getting married in the church. As much as it hurt I am grateful we broke up. I always had catholic guilt from my life choices with him. After we broke to I went to confession and felt better and being Catholic. I graduated college and am now a catholic school teacher (kindergarten). I very much love working in a Catholic school. I still very much struggle though in my faith. I go to mass on Sunday out of catholic guilt. I always zone out or don’t completely understand the readings. I really don’t know much about Catholicism like I should. I don’t know how to defend my faith at all. My Protestant friend tries to convert me to Christianity. (I know funny right). One thing that keeps me catholic is confession. I’ve had some very powerful confessions and I could never imagine being part of a religion where I couldn’t do that. It really weighs me down with all the bad that happens in the church and how people from the outside respond. Like the recent suicide priest or the scandals. Even a priest from my cluster parish left the priesthood because he had an affair with a married woman with 8 kids. They ran off and got married. When people come at me with all this stuff I have no idea how to respond. Being a catholic school teacher in our contracts we agree to live by church teaching so no cohabitation and stuff like that. A teacher I work with around my age said she is moving in with her boyfriend this year but going to have to keep it quiet because of our contracts. She actually teaches 8th grade and her students are making confirmation. It really bothers me because being a catholic school teacher makes me want to be a better person for my kids and then there are people I work with that don’t care and get away with it. I’m just lost and it’s hard to keep going. One thing I have noticed recently though is I enjoy mass weekly with our school on Friday’s. I’m sorry this is all over the place. I’m just struggling and want advice. ,a6wd9o,self.Catholicism,,True

My Christmas Homily draft - I invite your comments ...,Catholicism,"What do you want from Christmas? I’m not asking what you want for Christmas, but what you want FROM Christmas? I know what I want from Christmas, and it is good. It is really, really good. But more on that later ... For many adults, Christmas has become a time of mild cynicism. The message of Christmas is about peace, but peace seems impossibly far off. We want peace in the world, but when was the last time you believed we were actually close to achieving that? We want peace in our hearts, but we might find that for a moment or for a day, and then all of the peace-shattering realities come crashing back through, and our hearts are once again left in anguish. The message of Christmas is about happiness, but if peace is elusive and fleeting, happiness is all the more so. So many of the things that make us happy don’t last. We are happy because we have our health, but then we get sick. We are happy because we are secure, but then we lose our job. We are happy, but perhaps only a little bit happy, and we sense within ourselves that we are called to something far more profound than being a little bit happy. And every adult knows these things. And so, for many adults, the temptation is to say, “Christmas is for children. Let’s give them the best day we can.” But when we think that way, we’ve got it all wrong. When I was in high school, I was in the school choir. We used to sing a song in our Christmas concert that went, “Christmas is a feeling, bringing good cheer – it’s love and joy and laughter for people everywhere.” That song is precisely wrong. Christmas is not a feeling. Christmas is a person. And that person is Jesus. If you celebrate your child’s birthday, you are not rejoicing in the feeling the birthday gives you – you are not rejoicing in the details of the party or the success of the presents. You are rejoicing in your child. At Christmas, I am not celebrating peace or joy or laughter or gifts or decorations or the office party or carols or the meal. These things are good, but they don’t last. I’m celebrating Jesus. So what do you want from Christmas? I can tell you what I want. I want Jesus. I want Jesus to be born in my heart as he was born in Bethlehem. I want to adore him, as did the shepherds and the angels and the ox and ass and lambs. I want to hold him in my arms, closer to me than I am to myself, as did Mother Mary. I want to care and provide for those who love him, as did Saint Joseph. I want to announce his presence and herald the peace that only he can bring to the world, as did the angels. I want to bring him the best I’ve got and lay it next to him, as did the Magi. I want him to change my life, as he changed the world. I want him to deliver me and save me from my many sins. I want him to love me. And I want to love him – above all things I want to love him. Because I need him. Without him I am lost – a lonely, hopeless wanderer in a world I do not understand. I need him ... and so do you. I do not know where you are on your journey with him. Perhaps you are his best friend. Perhaps you have not spoken his name in reverence for the last twenty years. Maybe you are in church once a week, or once a year, or once a decade. Perhaps you are a saint who is tempted by sin, or perhaps you are a sinner who is haunted by the desire for sanctity. I do not know where you are, but I know this: Jesus intends a good for you that is more good than any that you have yet imagined or dared to hope for. And he intends that good for you. Not for the pious person who lives next door to you. Not for your saintly grandmother. Not for the Pope in Rome or the monk in a cave. He intends it for you. And he intends to enter your life just as he entered the world through his birth in Bethlehem. The time has come. Mary knew it. You know it. So welcome him in. You don’t have to make it happen somehow, any more than Mary had to make Jesus be born. He is coming. Welcome him in. Please, welcome him in. If you’re not quite sure how to do that, I can just tell you that you shouldn’t underestimate the power of simply saying it to him, “Jesus, I welcome you into my life. I need you. Save me.” And go to see your parish priest, and tell him you want to grow closer to Jesus. He will help you. The time for cynicism is over. The time for joy has come. This is the hour. Jesus is about to be born into your world. He is coming. Welcome him in. So now, in the silence, of your hearts, I encourage you to ask the question again.

Eucharist left in back of church,Catholicism,"Yesterday prior to communion I started thinking about threads I read here regarding theft of the Eucharist and had a sudden urge to watch everyone receive. Our diocese encourages kneeling reception on the tongue but our parish is probably 50/50. &#x200B; Anyway, I decided that it wasn't a likely issue at our small rural parish and went back to praying and got in line for communion. Almost everyone had received and the lines were unbalanced so I switched sides. Because of this, I had to go past the main door to return to my seat. &#x200B; As I walked, I was shocked to see a host sitting on top of a pamphlet on a ledge next to the door. I immediately consumed it and returned to my pew to pray. I was pretty rattled given my seemingly random thoughts a few minutes prior and seeing our Lord irreverently set upon a ledge. &#x200B; I told our priest after Mass but didn't get a chance to talk to him at length yet. &#x200B; Now, there is a chance it was an un-consecrated host. The ledge was about 4 feet from the table where the gifts are set and perhaps it was dropped and set aside by those presenting. But it seems more likely a non-Catholic relative of a parishioner or a visitor felt swept up in the communion line and didn't know what to do. I certainly pray that it was nothing malicious and that our Lord was not desecrated in any way. &#x200B; Did I do the right thing?

"So why in this day and age, when sin is pretty accepted in the culture, do we still have people who pretend to be good Catholics and live double lives or advocate wrong things?",Catholicism,"I ask this because I can think of quite a few people in my life who are complete fakes when it comes to religion. People who will talk all day about being pro life yet cheat on their spouses. People who say give to charity but are quite selfish. The list goes on. I know people make mistakes and frankly shit happens. But why have a complete double life? To me it seems especially terrible and imho those types of people have a special place in Hell. So why don’t people like that just leave. You love sin more? Well get out! Catholicism to me is about submission to God and trying my best, not skirting by. This especially hurts me because when I was a teen I heard so many people talk about faith and all this crap but didn’t even try to live it out in private.

What to do about disagreeing with the Church?,Catholicism,"I have been struggling with my faith for a pretty long time. This has made me feel a bit bad, I’ll be honest, but I can’t bring myself to personally accept some of the Church’s teachings on a number of issues of theology and doctrine. These aren’t small issues either, so please bear with me; I consider myself agnostic in that I can’t say for sure that God and the faith are all absolutely true, I do still believe though; I don’t really consider the Bible to be all that accurate historically, and I believe that evidence indicates that the synoptic gospels are more accurate to the historical reality of Jesus than the gospel of John; I don’t believe the Devil to be an actual evil entity but probably more of an agent of God; I have a tough time affirming the virgin birth and, maybe worst of all, I feel unconvinced that Jesus was truly God. Now I know how bad this seems and I will very willingly accept all of your prayers that, if my beliefs are wrong, I can find forgiveness from God and he’ll have mercy on me. I know that the Church represents the true faith and for what it’s worth, I do still try my best to submit to her will, because her will is his will (God’s). I’ve stopped taking communion because I think I might not be worthy of it? If I can’t even say the creed with genuine faith then am I even really a Catholic? I’m just feeling a bit lost and I’m not sure what to do. I’m 19 and study near eastern religious studies which hasn’t changed my views as much as made me feel more justified in what I believe, but it still doesn’t align with the Church.

Last Catholic in my family,Catholicism,"So I am the last Catholic of my family, and I really wanted to know why everyone else abandoned the church. So today, I had a discussion with my mother on why she is no longer Catholic and instead Protestant. She blames it on her growing up, not learning anything of the faith. Says her catechism was more of a daycare than anything else. But the Protestant church she goes to teaches all sorts of things about the bible. She really has no idea what it means to be Catholic. And I have found this to be true with most Catholics I know around her age (48). I dont know how catechism classes are like, I never went as she stopped taking me to Mass at a very young age. I had to self teach myself everything about the faith. So what went wrong with catechisms in the 70s for her and those her generation to be so oblivious to everything Catholic?",a26a8n,self.Catholicism,,True
I need help with how I look at women,Catholicism,"This is kind of difficult to describe but I'll do my best. &#x200B; So, for a long time, during high school especially, I willfully ignored and didn't care about my faith. I was heavily addicted to pornography and masturbation and like anyone else, hid it at all costs. For awhile there, I wouldn't even bring it up in confession because I was so afraid. &#x200B; Fast forward to last year while finishing up college. I finally realized that I couldn't keep living this lie and had to kick this addiction to those vices. Out of love and respect for others, myself, and most importantly, God. It was a really difficult thing to quit, and I am still quitting. I have failed many times along the way, but it has been probably around 6 months since the last time I masturbated or looked up porn. &#x200B; As I've committed to a deeper life of prayer, serving at my college Catholic group, started doing daily rosaries/lectio divinas, I have been growing slowly but surely. But something that has really been difficult for me is having purity in the way I look at others, particularly women. Whenever I see women, my eyes always seem to notice their breasts, backsides, curves, etc. I am constantly having to think about where I am looking. Even in religious images, I always notice these things, and I hate myself for that. I spend half of mass usually with my eyes closed so that I can avoid the temptation all together, but I wish I could just look at women normally without this. I also have innuendo or sexual thoughts kind of zoom through my mind or pop into my head. I do my best to pray to Mary and St. Joseph for purity when these things happen, but it just doesn't seem like it's getting any better. And the worse part is that these seem at their worst during mass, prayer moments, etc, so I ultimately feel like I'm distracted from them. I never feel tempted to act on these thoughts, entertain them, or anything like that. Once I notice that they're there, I try to immediately address them and move on. &#x200B; I realize that part of this is due to my history of addiction, and I fully accept the consequences of that. Watching pornography and seeing women and people being used as objects in that way has made it really hard to go back, but I am finding myself getting anxious and wanting to despair about it. I want to continue to grow in holiness, purity, and see women as daughters of God. How can I grow in this and combat these intense distractions? This has been a huge barrier lately and having a scrupulous nature about things already, this has been bringing some of that back.

I say we send Catholic missionaries directly into Salt Lake City and Provo, among everywhere else 2. evangelicals/pentecostals - constant focus on renewal and fervor 3. anglicans lutheran - Required support of state religion, even by nonbelievers 4. islam - discouragement of apostasy, blasphemy (of course the penalty should not be death or severe, or anything like that!) 5. Orthodoxy - making religion a cultural value to cling to, in addition to a set of religious beliefs. 6. Anything I’m missing from others? We need to do these to help the Church grow - not shrink.

A question regarding suffering,Catholicism,"I am not sure if this has been asked by anybody. I know I cannot find the answer when I try to search for it online or on Reddit. I apologize if this comes off in any way other than a legitimate question as I would very much like all of your perspectives! When I see people answer the question about why suffering exists or why it is useful I always see something along the lines of 'we can unite our suffering with that of Christ on the cross' or 'Christ suffered for us' etc. I know, for me at least, statements like this have always bugged me. In terms of physical suffering, Jesus only endured great pain for a short time. Other than that, from what we know, he seemed to have quite the normal life, especially for the times. I know His family had to take him away from Israel to keep him safe in Egypt and little is known about this time but it doesn't seem to be some extreme circumstances that other people were unfamiliar back then, or even now. The greatest causes of suffering I can see him bearing are the following: knowing that people were denying him, thus condemning themselves, and the (what I can only imagine to be) extreme pain of His path on the Via Dolorosa that ended in His crucifixion (which I also imagine is very painful). This doesn't change the fact that he didn't seem to have to suffer nearly as much as many humans have to suffer. I work in the medical field (emergency medicine) and am exposed to extreme suffering on the part of the patients that I see. Children with advanced stage cancer, excruciatingly painful degenerative diseases of the mind and body afflicting those of all ages, horrible life altering incidences of traumatic injury, child abuse, spousal abuse, deaths that tear at ones soul etc. Things that cause horrible pain and suffering. Suffering that is not just a few days in duration but will be with these poor people until the end. I won't go too much into the negative aspect beyond that, but my point is that the suffering many people have to go through is of a far longer duration and, in my mind, far more mentally taxing to endure than a few days of extreme pain during His arduous journey at the end. I have much that causes me to suffer and crosses to bear (nowhere near the suffering I see at work though!) and I struggle with them constantly and when I suffer or when I see the suffering of others, this is always in my prayers because I want to understand the whys of what I see. I would like to hear your opinions on this matter and maybe have my heart soothed by my fellow faithful! Thanks everybody :).

How to fulfill my duties as a godfather to a child whose parents are not practicing Catholics?,Catholicism,"My brother and his wife are not practicing Catholics.

The baptism was about 4 years ago, and I was not at all a practicing Catholic at the time. I had no idea there were any real responsibilities; I thought of it as a title with no real meaning, and my only function was to show up for the baptism. Having returned to the Church about 6 months ago, I now see that godparents have a significant role in their godchild's upbringing in the faith. My understanding is, if the parents don't raise their child in the faith, then it is the responsibility of the godparents. My godson is about 4 now. What the heck am I supposed to do? How do I raise him in the faith? What does that even look like? The best I can think of right now is getting my godson some Catholic bedtime books as Christmas gifts. I'm really lost here.

Despite this he is not willing to be convinced of the existence of God without empirical evidence. How would I go about evangelizing him? And even if I am able to prove to him that God exists, how would I prove that Catholicism is the true faith?

A few questions for inquiry...,Catholicism,"(Using a throwaway for anonymity) I’m currently an Episcopalian, but for some reason I keep feeling a draw to the Church. Unfortunately, there are a few things that make me hesitant to take the next step (RCIA) and I am not sure how to reconcile these issues. First and foremost, I am divorced and remarried. I know that I can seek annulment so this part isn’t the main issue. The biggest one is that my current husband, whom I love dearly, is not religious in the least and strongly objects Catholicism period. When we first met, I was going through an awful (decade long) phase of atheism (first husband was mentally/sexually abusive and also a staunch atheist, thus why I am divorced) although I was raised Protestant. When I made my way back to Christ, it was certainly not easy to explain to my current husband. He became very upset and misunderstood a lot. It took a lot of convincing on my part to assure him that I was even still the same person. I know he has a pretty strong anti-Catholic sentiment. He is not the only one though. Both of my parents feel the same way as well. My mother was a cradle Catholic who left the Church and was never confirmed (if my memory serves correctly), and my father was raised Protestant. They would not be very supportive, and my father feels that veneration of the saints is a form of idolatry. I already feel quite isolated in my faith and conversion would only further this and cause a great rift in my marriage. I just truly have no idea how to deal with any of it. Instinctually, I know that God supersedes all else and I should follow Him, but my situation is complex. I am fearful that my faith is considered invalid, such as my baptism and partaking of the Eucharist. I know that Protestantism just does not feel right, especially with the rise of these entertainment-style services. It is of my opinion that I go to service to worship seriously, not to be entertained, but I suppose that would call for an entirely different post/rant. Thank you for any advice.

minimal Catholicism,Catholicism,"So, I'm in RCIA. Last night we talked about the magisterium, but the pace was breakneck and there was little time for questions or elaboration. Obviously not everything in the Catechism is beyond question: It's a compendium of what the magisterium holds to be true, but you can deny various claims in it and still be a perfectly faithful Catholic (with some provisos about needing grounds for the denials and some provisos about obedience). Since this is the case, what are the minimal beliefs that a Catholic must hold in order to be Catholic? Nicene Creed, various beliefs about the Catholic Church being the One Church instituted by Christ, primacy of Rome, ...? I suspect this is a foolish way of looking at things, but as someone tiptoeing towards Catholicism from atheism, it seems helpful to me. There ain't no way I'm capable of accepting the full body of recommended-but-not-dogmatic tradition wholesale.

Avoid them. 18 People of that sort are servants not of our Lord Christ, but of their own greed; and with talk that sounds smooth and reasonable they deceive the minds of the unwary. 19 Your obedience has become known to everyone, and I am very pleased with you for it; but I should want you to be learned only in what is good, and unsophisticated about all that is evil.

"How to answer, or even address, someone who follows a general Christian religion but doesn't believe in any form of set theology or dogma, and rather puts in its place the idea that the bible is simple enough to be understood by itself and nothing more?",Catholicism,"Sorry for the long-winded title, but I tried to accurately capture the idea. **TLDR**: My brain is actually scrambled and very confused. Anyone got any ideas? My protestant family member and I tend to have very polite conversations about religion, and often we can find common ground to some extent. But, in a discussion over authority, dogma, and what God's grace actually *is*, this person ultimately confessed that their beliefs come down to two 'faith statements' and noting more: 1) that Jesus died for us and 2) that everything the bible says is true, and whatever contradicts it is false. I'm honestly perplexed and quite appalled to be honest -- it is such a skeleton of true Christianity, and on top of that it doesn't even make any sense. Nothing is self-explanatory from that perspective. I brought up several points: How can you be certain the bible was compiled rightly? How can you profess faith in a trinity (which they do) even though it isn't explicitly described in scripture as it commonly is in theology? How can you even accept the idea that Jesus paid the price for our sins (at their core, the person is a penal substantiation atonement supporter) when language about the nature of Christ's sacrifice and it's profoundness isn't explicitly stated in the bible? I could go on and on for a while. I have to confess that I truly am stumbled, and I said to this family member that their line of thinking ultimately results in nothing but subjective opinion after subjective opinion. Nothing about it is convincing at all, and when questioned about evidence for their beliefs they essentially said 'it's what the bible says, plain and simple.' When I rebutted and said that pretty much anyone can say that about anything, they dismissed my arguments because, as one might expect, 'it's not what the bible says.' And to top it all off, here's the kicker: they don't believe human reason is a good thing, and they think that human's cannot possibly come to any significant or dogmatic theological conclusions, since 'his ways are better then our ways; his thoughts are better than are thoughts' and, essentially, that all human knowledge is a corruption and it's better to have blind faith in everything than to even attempt to work out a theological problem. I don't even know where to begin. This person is someone who I would consider very smart; how can they even believe this hogwash? I told them that literally nobody in Christian history, all the way back to the earliest centuries of Christian writing, agrees with them about this, to which they responded 'yeah, and that's a clear example of how man's knowledge corrupts. As soon as Jesus ascended into heaven the people got it all wrong [paraphrase].' Ummm, *what?* This isn't some weird Mormon Great Apostasy fanfiction. I'd go on but my thoughts are becoming a bit muddled and confused. There was a lot more to the conversation than what I wrote, but that's the basics. Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated!

How Do I Accept Jesus Christ As My Lord And Savior,Catholicism,"I have been looking into faith for the past two years. Starting with Mere Christianity, I've read many of the apologetics (Peter Kreeft, Chesterton, Lee Strobel), I've watched the debates, followed the YouTube priests (Father Mike Schmitz, Bishop Barron), read up on most of the theological arguments and counter-arguments. I have researched competing views, New Age, occultism, eastern spirituality, gnosticism. I have gone to a TLM Church for two years attending 40+ masses and even sung in the Gregorian choir. 'Rationally', I am convinced of Christianity and theologically I strongly prefer the cosmology over monism or pantheism. But in my heart I still don't believe, fully. Maybe I fall under the type that is too theoretical, blinded by the pride of 'intelligence' (as opposed to wisdom). But I cannot lie to myself. I have not accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Rationally I feel like I should, my life is falling to pieces, I've gotten on my knees and tried to pray to Jesus to please tell me how I can accept him. Rationally I know that it is my pride and my fear of letting go of my worldly plans and desires, and not wanting to need to rely on anyone, and perhaps also the fear of being an outcast in my highly secular country. I just don't know what to do anymore, but I feel like reading more books or more theory is not the answer. If I had to defend the faith apologetically I can easily do so, but in my heart Christianity is still just a perspective that I happen to be familiar with and like, but not my true and full belief.",a3fp6h,self.Catholicism,,True
Slightly strange experience at Mass,Catholicism,"Hi. I want to share my experience at Mass this evening to see if I can get some lay people advice and some priest/religious people advice. I must introduce myself by telling that I suffer migraine headaches from time to time, and that when I'm in the middle of a headache I 'become' more sarcastic, violent, aggressive, impatient and careless with the people around me. I also tend to 'binge' with pleasures, like eating chocolate, or sweet things, or waste time on the Internet. My concentration also decreases, and I find very difficult to be productive at work. It's not that I can't resist/overcome all of those things, but it's more difficult than usual. So, today I have been with a headache, and the aforementioned 'signs' have arised. After being harsher with people around me, I've decided to end my day going to Sunday's evening Mass. There, I've told God my struggles, and have slightly complained about my headaches. In that exact moment, I've 'heard' a 'voice' in my heart, that has come with a pleasant feeling: 'The headaches are part of your preparation for the suffering of martyrdom'.

P.S.: Waiting for my own death is the surest way of knowing the truth of the statement, but I hope to know it before! **TL, DR:** When complained to God about headaches at Mass, I 'heard' a 'voice' telling me they were preparation for my own martyrdom.

Is there anything you guys can recommend that specifically deal with this issues in depth? Thanks.",a47j3n,self.Catholicism,,True
Was Adam an Actual Guy?,Catholicism,"Pardon if this seems like an elementary question, but it's one I've always had. I was raised evangelical, but I'm currently attending a Catholic university (Notre Dame; RIP our Cotton Bowl loss), and after taking a 1st semester theology class, I realized that Catholics and evangelicals differ majorly on the creation story. Catholics seem to hold that the creation account in Genesis is largely poetic per its genre while evangelicals hold that everything it entails literally happened. I am far more sympathetic to the Catholic view. However, how does one explain verses like 1 Cor 15:22 which directly reference Adam as if he were an individual? Also, what about John 7:22-23 which directly references the Sabbath? Finally, how would one explain things like the tree of knowledge of good and evil? I'm not sure how that could be allegorical let alone a historical fact. Thanks!",aau8nw,self.Catholicism,,True
Am I wrong to have faith in God's forgiveness when repenting with perfect contrition in this instance?,Catholicism,"I comitted a mortal sin last night. I was very angry with myself. Immediately prayed an act of perfect contrition to the best of my ability and decided after daily Mass tomorrow to ask for a quick (literally 1 minute) Confession after Mass. Father shrugs me off. So then after work I text up my buddy priest and he says he would but he's off campus. Am I wrong to think that God legit wouldn't punish people in Hell just because priests can't hear my confession? Isn't that limiting God's mercy to human confines - which makes no sense since humans are bound by the sacraments, but not God. Am I wrong to think that God forgives easily during repentance outside of the Sacrament of Confession? Like, I read a lot in the Bible about how God's mercy, and how that God desires you to be saved even more than you do... and it just doesn't add up that I could go to Hell because my priest shrugged me off and had to go bless some ones flower pots... what could possibly be more important than absolving people from their sin and saving them from Hellfire besides the Mass? It's stuff like this that makes me seriously have faith that God is insanely merciful to people who repent outside of the Sacrament, and forgives those who at least attempt perfect contrition... am I wrong to think that?",a74dpa,self.Catholicism,,True

You can find it *.* &#x200B; I would like to know, how the Gospel of Mary and other apocrypha are seen on this sub. &#x200B; **Here are some excerpts of the article/essay (translated with Google translator):** 'Much, however, deviates significantly from the Bible. It is a separate cosmos of originally Christian doctrines, which for power-political reasons were wiped out of the tradition of the Church in the early centuries of the Western era - because powerful men wanted to determine what their followers should believe. Most believers today know little or nothing about the dramatic inner conflicts of the beginning. Christianity, as almost everyone knows, relies only on a small part of the traditions. And so it remains largely unknown that in the early centuries a different, perhaps more peaceful and tolerant Christianity was possible, and that there were once clusters of Jesus followers in which women were allowed to teach, preach and lead churches. When today's Christians look back on the years of creation, they see above all a time of martyrs and church fathers. But there have been those other communities too. In the name of a single and unified religion, they were oppressed, forbidden, persecuted and finally forgotten.' &#x200B; 'Probably no other biblical figure has undergone such a brutal transformation over time as Mary Magdalene. After several old representations she is said to have even been ranked above the male apostles. Centuries later, influential men reinterpreted it as a remorseful sinner who, in her former life, was supposed to have been nothing but a prostitute. Neither the New Testament nor the apocryphal writings provide any evidence for this interpretation. And yet she still determines the image that many of Mary Magdalene make. With her, the men of the church not only marginalized the Magdala woman but all women. Perhaps they would not have got away with it if the story on the papyrus with the Berlin depot number P 8502 A had not disappeared from the Christian tradition at some point.' &#x200B; 'A woman as head of the expectant church? That may have been an imposition for the men in other groups. In their own interest, the religious leaders have sided with Peter in important dioceses and above all in Rome. The popes see themselves as his successors, their outstanding position leads them away from the special closeness of this apostle to Jesus Christ. A female rival was - and is - not allowed.' &#x200B; 'If women from leading positions in the Church had not been ousted, humanity might have developed differently. Few things shaped history in Europe and beyond as the thoroughly male Christian power apparatus that was interwoven with state institutions. Early Christianity, with its often esoteric groups, shows that for a short time another church was possible. More focused on personal spirituality than missioning and conquest.' &#x200B; *Edit: provided link to original article*",a94dm0,self.Catholicism,,True

The doctrine of Papal infallibility was introduced by Pope Pius IX at the First Vatican council. Pope Pius IX was the 255th Pope. Just think about it, 254 Popes (including, according to Catholic Church, people like St. Peter, St Clement, St Linus, St Fabian, St Gregory etc) lived their lives without knowing that they were infallible, but then it was decided that Popes were infallible.

I have been pretty religious for most of my life, but when I came to college I encountered the most troubling thing to my faith life I have experienced in my life so far. There's this guy who lives in my dorm, let's call him Dan. Dan is the most catholic lay person I have ever met. He goes to mass every single day, goes to confession weekly, and prays the rosary every day. Very often I go to the chapel in my dorm to either pray or play the piano and he's nearly always there. He spends almost 100% of his time either in class, or praying. If you were to boil all the teachings of the bible down and say 'what does this look like in practice?' I think that Dan is the best example I have ever seen, and it's not particularly close. Dan is also one of the most despised people I have ever met. Every single person who knows him absolutely hates his guts, and it is specifically because he bears total witness to his faith at every moment. He has been known to get into long conversations with people about topics like pornography, excessive drinking, etc. (things that most college guys do, which are obviously sins). He is never angry, never mean in these conversations, but because he cannot bear to see another person live in sin. To him, every sin he sees is a person who could potentially miss out on the joy of heaven, and that is something which causes him great anguish. &#x200B; My struggle lies with the following conflict. I understand that I am called to bear total witness to my faith, to hold nothing back from God's will.

Does anyone find it hard to love God?,Catholicism,"Simple question, does anyone find it hard to love God? I am starting to find my way to Catholicism but I am finding a road block in God. I find it fairly easy to feel for Jesus and Mary, maybe because they are people so I can understand their motives and actions. When I try to think about God I can't even comprehend what he is, all I am left with is questions. With Jesus and Mary I know that they were very human in their actions, they were submitting to a higher power, but because God is the creator it just seems to leave me with questions. For example you would probably say 'You should love God because he gave his son for our sins', but that leaves me with the question of why? If God created everything then he didn't need to give his son for our sins, he could have vanished them away however he wanted. With people you can learn about their motives and actions, I have no idea how you find these answers with God. I don't know what actions are Gods, I don't know how he acts or his personality other than accounts of mercy and love. Did anyone else find this problem? I want to believe but I am finding it hard. I feel a pull towards Mary and Jesus, I don't have much doubt in them, but I feel like I am leaving God in the background.

I Feel Like God is Calling Me,Catholicism,"Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone. I want to share what i've been feeling and thinking of since years ago. I was born and raised in a muslim family, I've begun to question God and religion in high school and left Islam just before college (though secretly because it would be dangerous to admit it openly). I've been an agnostic atheist ever since but as of lately I've been thinking more and more about religion, in particular, catholicism. Catholicism fascinates me since my childhood, I used to pretend to be a catholic, I was envious of my christian and catholic friends because they were able to attend masses in beautiful churches. I always admire how in christianity and catholicism God is portrayed as a father figure and we are His children. This admiration is very strong when it comes to catholicism, there's this sacred feeling I couldn't quiet explain when I think of catholicism. I remember when I was still in elementary school i used to feel the spirit of christmas eventhough I don't understand what it really is, I even watched the vatican christmas mass in television every year. I grew up feeling very interested in catholicism. Though my parents keep on teaching me islam, it never make my interest in catholicism waver. It grew into such an extend that in hard times I can feel Jesus' presence despite the fact that I am not a believer, I also found myself wanting to attend masses and join communion, and when I read the bible i feel like i am reading something i've read thousands times before, something dear and true to my heart. I don't have any logical explanation as to why I feel this way, I just am, it's just the feeling of being touched by something divine and profound. Sadly though, I have to keep all of these private and cannot ask for any help from local churces or pastor since as I've stated before, it would be dangerous. But despite all of that, I feel like God is calling me since years and years ago. What should I do? Btw thank you for taking your time to read this (also, this is a throwaway account but I will try my best to keep up with all of you) ",a2e25x,self.Catholicism,,True

Was this liturgical abuse? [Help/Advice],Catholicism,"Making an exception to my Internet break to post this, my soul is at grave unrest. I'm a woman in RCIA. Just before Mass yesterday, the deacon asked me to light the candles at the altar. I complied, half out of impulse, half out of thinking he knows by now that I'm only a catechumen, so he's just asking me to do that one thing because there are no altar servers at this Mass (it's situated far from the main church, only a priest and a deacon travel to celebrate it) and so there's no altar boy role to adhere to. In short, it's okay for a woman to light the altar candles in this case. He also asked me to pour out the holy water, which I did, under his direction (I have autism and don't know how much 'just about enough' is). I don't feel right about all that now. I'm also torn. I'm wondering why he didn't just light the candles and pour the holy water himself. Why didn't he just ask one of the male attendants nearby? Basically, here's why I think I didn't desecrate the Mass a bit yesterday: * He's a deacon and may very well understand this better than I do. Maybe I'm just the prideful type of trad. * No one there was an official altar boy. I could have performed two duties reserved for altar boys, just without any need to actually be an altar server. * My very traditional RCIA teacher had several opportunities to stop me and did not even question it, during or after. Here's why I'm worried, though: * Lighting altar candles is something altar servers do, and altar servers should only be male. I am not male, so I should not be performing altar server duties. * It's an OF Mass. I'm not ragging on the OF, I'm just aware of the 'swinging room' for liturgical abuse in these, and consider it a factor. * There was no time for reverence before I lit the candles, I was just politely asked to do it. This gives me a sneaking suspicion that just about anyone could light them, that it wasn't seen as a big deal and so there's ripeness for abuse. * My gut feeling is telling me I was out of line. I could still be wrong, of course. I plan to ask my RCIA teacher and possibly a priest about this, but I want to read your discussion first. I'm lost, honestly. Pax Christi. **Edit: Pax Christi, indeed! Just got off the phone with my RCIA teacher, he says it's fine and I actually did the right thing. I'll let this post be up, anyway, because I'm bad at deleting posts on mobile and this could be educational for someone out there.

I have some questions about the Roman Catholic faith.,Catholicism,"I am a christian who was raised as a Lutheran. I love God and am very philosophical when it comes to what I believe. Here are some questions I have about the Roman Catholic Church. 1.) The authority of the Roman Bishop. I understand clearly from scripture that Peter is in some way above the other apostles. Peter is promised to be given the keys to the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 16 and has the special role to feed Jesus’ sheep in John 21. However, I do not like the idea of the Pope being infallible (in ex cathedral statements). Can you defend that teaching with scripture? I head Fr. Mike from Ascension presents say that Jesus referred to a passage in Isaiah in Matthew 16. Just please explain yourselves Papists! :) 2.) The Marian Dogmas. I actually appeal to the Marian Dogmas. I know you don’t actually worship Mary. Actually I find the mother of God very important (as she is the mother of the king), and it would make sense for her to be immaculately conceived if she is the new Eve (which I believe she certainly is). However where is the scriptural support for it? I heard an argument a while ago from Peter Diamond (I’ll get to sadevecantism later!) that used the Greek word for “full of grace” to show that Mary was conceived immaculately. Again explain yourselves Mary worshippers!! :) Also, I just don’t understand at all the perpetual virginity of Mary. Like there are brothers of Jesus in the Bible like James. Explain yourselves you crazy Quadrity worshippers!!! :) 3.) The deuterocanonical books. Just explain please. Tbh I’ve never really understood how to find what books are inspired and which are not. I know your answer will probably be something like “Muh Church.” (And you’re probably right). :) 4.) Soteriology (The doctrine of salvation) Ok, as a Lutheran, I am VERY concerned about the Roman Catholic soteriology and salvation in general. From the Lutheran perspective we believe that faith is a gift of God that is brought about by his grace, but I find myself disagreeing with that. Some people I think even if God had completely revealed himself the person would still reject God and go to his own way. I don’t see God as violating human freedom. He very clearly does care about choice as he does in Deuteronomy 30. Adam and Eve were given choice in the garden. However the Lutheran position provides some good objections to the “semi-pelagian” teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. Firstly, if you could choose to have faith, would that be a work that you have to do in order to be saved? Secondly, does not the Roman Catholic Church teach that we must do good works and have faith in order to be saved? I agree works are necessarily a part of faith, but we can by no means save ourselves. Explain yourselves pelagians! :) 5.) Marriage in heaven Ok, this one is a little stupider than the rest. Most Protestants don’t think there is marriage in heaven at all other than Christ’s marriage to his church. The Eastern Orthodox, from what I have gathered, believe that marriage does continue in heaven just not necessarily sexual and fallen aspects of relationships. What is the catholic teaching on this? I may have more soon, but I hope this is good. Thank you. God Bless. ",a2g8vg,self.Catholicism,,True

The parish I attended had the Latin Gloria, Credo, Pater Noster, Angus Dei, and Sanctus. All the antiphons and limited use of hymnal.

"Help with Apologetics: Regarding the heretical belief that there will be a 'spiritual mystical reign' for 1,000 years after the Second Coming.",Catholicism,"*Please help me prove to an interlocutor (Dr. Kelly Bowring) that they have a warped interpretation of Christ's Second Coming. If you choose to respond, please provide specific citations from the Church either directly from Divine Revelation or from the doctrinal or magisterial Catholic Tradition. This is not merely a theoretical squabble, this man, who happens to be a Phd carrying Theologian educated at a Pontifical University, is leading many people astray on youtube. Perhaps you can help make the case against Dr. Bowring more evident and impossible to deny with other sources? \*P.S. Mr. Ron Conte has already written in more depth about some of Bowring's other numerous errors, here:*  **An earnest Catholic:** Thank you for replying, but your private conviction (and that of the controversial woman known as 'Maria Divine Mercy') are still at odds with the clearly defined Dogma of the Catholic Church. According to your teaching, AFTER the Second Coming, there will be a 'spiritual, mystical reign' for 1,000 years; and following that, there will be a time of 'confrontation' (when Satan is let loose on the earth for a temporal duration of time to possibly gain more souls into eternal damnation). Whether or not you refer to the 1,000 years as a 'physical reign' or a 'spiritual reign' makes absolutely no difference at all. Human beings are constituted of both a finite 'body' and a finite 'spirit,' therefore, any talk about a 'millennium of peace' for humanity AFTER the the Second Coming means that the finite, Created universe will also have to go on as well... This is still the heresy of Chiliasm or Millenarianism, albeit in a 'modified' form, which the Church explicitly condemns (see C.C.C. 676; also: Denzinger-Schonmetzer 3839 \[Denzinger 2296 in the 'old numbering'\]). Long before the modern Catechism condemned this error, the Second Ecumenical Council in the year 381 AD infallibly taught that finite human life \[along with the finite, Created universe\] cannot possibly go on AFTER the Second Coming.\* \*Note that the Second Ecumenical Council in 381 AD. condemned Mr. Bowring's idea when it condemned the heretic Apollinarius who similarly preached about thousand-year reign of Christ. To put a stop to further attempts at introducing this spurious teaching, the Fathers of the Council inserted into the Creed the following words regarding the Second Coming: **'His Kingdom shall have no end.'** This means there will be no interruptions or 'cosmic intermissions' or 'exchanges of power' during Christ's reign. Now, if we take a look at Mr. Bowring's timeline published on his website, he elaborates on what he means by a 'spiritual, mystical reign' on earth during a millennium: 'All on earth will dwell in mystical union with Christ (and the Saints) in the perfection of earthly (though not yet beatific) happiness... and we will continue to have earthly families and offspring (***NOW BORN WITHOUT LABOR PAIN***)... All will live in love of God and neighbor, with no more physical death, sin or sorrow, and no more spiritual or bodily evils, all united in everlasting peace… and each person in the New Kingdom will ***EVENTUALLY ENTER THE BEATIFIC VISION*** as their earthly life comes to an end.' Bowring reiterates his heretical position further on: 'At the end of the millennium (1000 years) of peace, all who are still alive on earth in the New Paradise will be taken into the beatific vision of Heaven forever!' Mr. Bowring, why do you presume to have the right to change the Catholic Deposit of Faith? In the name of Jesus Christ, please publicly renounce your convoluted claims or else demonstrate to your audience how your claims do not contradict the Second Ecumenical Council. Moreover, please renounce your promotion of the so-called 'revelations' of 'Maria Divine Mercy' and defend the one and only Universal and Apostolic Faith!﻿ **\*Dr. Kelly Bowring has not yet responded any further.**",a6jnfg,self.Catholicism,,True
Does it really matter what we call God or how we worship him?,Catholicism,Hello I have a friend who worships God in a.... unusual way. He believes that every God is merely a different manifestation or aspect of God. Similar to the idea of the trinity. So he does certain rituals to honor various Gods but recognizes and acknowledges that they're just different names and manifestations of the one true God.

"I recently learned of the difference between kataphatic and apophatic prayer. One entails the senses (e.g. visual imagery), and the other eschew the senses. Ignatian spirituality is a good example of 'kataphatic'. What do you think of imagery / imagination when praying?",Catholicism," >Unlike Roman Catholicism, the Orthodox Tradition does not encourage the use of mental imagery. In fact, it almost appears to forbid sensory imagination during prayer altogether. In the words of one of the contemporary Orthodox elders, Abbot Nikon (Vorobyev) (1894-1963), “that, which sternly, decisively, with threats and imploring is forbidden by the Eastern Fathers—Western ascetics strive to acquire through all efforts and means” (424). >Eastern Orthodoxy displays a great degree of uniformity in following a path of stillness of thought and silence of mind to achieve the prayer of heart in private devotion. Saint John Climacus writes in The Ladder (28:19) that “the beginning of prayer consists in chasing away invading thoughts…” (285) The mind is to be freed from all thoughts and images and focused on the words of prayer. Further in the chapter on prayer (28), St. John instructs not to accept any sensual images during prayer, lest the mind falls into insanity (42; 289); and not to gaze upon even necessary and spiritual things (59; 292).

She herself doesn't go to church, she's a vague New Age Spirituality and mediates money spells, Sin of the Flesh, I know, but when she thinks the Catholic Church is man made institution that wants to control and brainwash for money to live off of or something, and her impression of the Methodist Church is 'praise Jebus, wahoo! love-e-dovy;' how are you going to change her mind on that one? &#x200B; Anyway, my problem is, I kinda don't want to go.

That I can marvel at a beautiful landscape, immerse myself in an intriguing story, fill my belly with decent food, savor a nice cup of tea, enjoy a lovely piece of music, even so much as laugh at a funny meme -- all are signs of God's loving kindness. Every one is a crack in the walls of this sin-bound world, letting the light of Heaven shine through as God hammers away to give us a way out. Even the worst days are a mercy, because they are only days, and not eternity. There will come a new day, with new opportunities. And the last day, that Eternal Day, I can surely hope that I will be with God. In that case then, there is cause for gratitude and rejoicing in all things. In every slightest joy, and even in the pains of this life (for they are but transient pains), I should give thanks and praise to my God, for they are signs of His mercy and kindness, gifts from His abundant generosity.",a4htdo,self.Catholicism,,True

A Protestant needs your help,Catholicism,"Although my wife is Catholic, I currently go to an Anglican church (but perhaps not for very much longer). I'm on the parish council, and the vicar had decided to open discussion about whether the parish should bless gay marriages or not (following the national synod's decision to allow it on a parish-by-parish basis). My vicar is all for it and even wants to go further than blessing to actually marrying gay couples. I'm clearly against it, but I feel the parish council will vote in his favour since he has a lot of sway. Before the last council meeting, he wrote a long essay about what the scriptures say about homosexuality and claimed it either doesn't and we are reading it wrong, or it was a cultural issue at the time and we've evolved culturally since then. His entire argument is cultural relativism, but like a politician he is very eloquent. As he has already dismissed everything in the bible, I'm looking for quotes from the church fathers and doctors about homosexuality and about cultural relativism. I want to prove that the church has always seen the issue of homosexuality clearly and has always sung the same tune. I want to prove that it wasn't just a cultural issue of the Jews in Leviticus but that the church fathers also interpreted it in the same way. And some quotes to show that the church shouldn't conform to the world would be grand too. I'm starting to compile my list of quotes, but I was hoping you lot could help.

"It is worthy of pious belief that Joseph was also without original sin, like Mary and Jesus",Catholicism,"Today is the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, in which we celebrate that she was conceived without original sin. I’ve been reading 1888 book *. Healy goes more into the theological arguments about why Joseph was free from original sin, although probably in a different way than Mary's Immaculate Conception. One interesting argument is that the best protector and guardian for the 14-year-old Blessed Virgin Mary and newborn baby who is the Savior of all would be a husband who like them was also free from original sin. I found Healy's arguments pretty convincing, and wanted to share that to believe that Joseph was free from original sin is worthy of pious belief (although not something one is obligated to believe). **Edit:** To clarify, Healy is not necessarily saying that St. Joseph was immaculately conceived like Mary, but that he was cleansed of original sin, possibly at a time after his birth: From these expressions we may gather that the learned preacher [Saint Gerson] was persuaded that, if Joseph was not, like the Blessed Virgin, entirely preserved from the original stain, he must nevertheless have been speedily withdrawn from the hard slavery of Satan, so that his beautiful soul, enriched with every gift, shone resplendently before God from the first moments of his life. This doctrine was preached by Gerson at the Council of Constance, in presence of the very Fathers who had deputed him to place on record the conciliar decrees; and not only had these Fathers not a word to say in opposition, but they greatly applauded his discourse and ordered it to be published, accompanied by a notice that it had been delivered before them.

Muslim in week of guidance,Catholicism,"Hi r/catholicism firstly I want to wish everyone a very blessed and joyous Christmas. To save the long introduction or background here is a link to a post about my inquiry into the church and within it my original post to reddit that mentioned some theological hurdles I faced while seeking out christianity.  On this Christmas Eve I realize that for the last year or so I have been secretly identifying with much of Christianity in Catholicism and Orthodoxy and though I haven’t made up my mind on which I believe is the original church in which the apostles established I can conclude that accepting Jesus in my life sounds so welcoming and yet so scary at the same time. If you’re not familiar apostasy in Islam is not a light subject matter and though I thankfully am in the West the potential emotional consequences by family and of leaving behind everything I know is such a frightening idea and has left me in a state in where I am neither practicing Islam nor completely identifying as a Christian, meaning I don’t feel fully connected to God which terrifies me. I’m not really sure what I’m asking for but if maybe someone out there can point me in the right direction whether it’s by offering your own conversion story or perhaps making a suggestion on what I can do moving forward? I know this is a lot to ask for on the eve of Christmas and I hope to not take much of your time away from praying and rejoicing in Christ with your family but it would be so helpful in helping me on my own path. To the muslim community It’s almost as if not practicing Islam is better than converting to another religion because in Islam it’s better to be a non practicing Muslim than to be an apostate, they encourage freedom of knowledge but if that leads to changing religion it becomes a death sentence which makes no sense as it also says only God is responsible for bringing life or death to someone.

I feel devastated and angry,Catholicism,"I know this is mostly emotional, but I need to get my thoughts out right now. I thank anyone who reads this in advance! You have all been a wonderfully supportive community in times of need. As some may know, I am Catholic, and my wife is Protestant. We were married by a Protestant minister (I agreed to this since her parents are so anti Catholic that they would almost have been unwilling to come to a Mass), and we con-validated the marriage at our home Church by a wonderful priest we know. The marriage has been tough for us at times, but we love each other, and I can honestly say that challenging each other in our faith lives has helped us both to grow tremendously in a spiritual sense. I have prayed to God endlessly - every single day, increasingly and more intensely all the time - for unity, for her conversion, or even for her to grow more willing to want to discuss our faith more, so I can help her see the beauty of the Catholic Faith. Despite those prayers, nothing yet has changed, but I still entrust my intentions to God and continue on. All I hear is silence, all I see is a lack of change, but I continue on regardless with trust in the Lord. This Christmas we spent with her parents. They are lovely people, but again, not only not Catholic but honestly believe that we worship Mary, are idolators: you know the whole package. Going to Mass was out of the question on Sunday since they took us to their Protestant service and were not willing to go to a Mass. However, at my insistence, they allowed me to take their car and go with my wife to a Christmas Vigil Mass. A wonderful chance for us to discuss faith lovingly and remind my wife of the beauty of Catholicism right? Wrong. The “Mass” was an utter disgrace. Hideous music, a priest who continuously interrupted the Mass to insert bizarre commentary, a homily that sounded almost like a homeless man ranting about nonsense, a congregation that was clearly “going through the motions...” it was horrifying. My wife kept looking at me and essentially saying “YOU insisted that we go to THIS?” I didn’t even go to receive communion because I was so disturbed. I couldn’t even genuflect as we left because of the crush of people shoving me out the door. I’m just glad my in laws weren’t there to see it. I’m actually glad they refused to go to Mass... that feels horrible to say. I know this happens. I know. But as hard as I’ve prayed, as much as I’ve studied to prepare for discussions with my wife and her family that just don’t happen, as much as I have tried to witness my faith through devotion and charity... not only does NOTHING happen after years, but yesterday felt like God was mocking my prayers. I was so angry I wanted to go scream at the crucifix. I felt that I finally understood the emotion of the phrase “O God why have you abandoned me?” I know the story of Job well, and in my pride I suppose I always thought I’d just inherently understand the response; and intellectually I do. But I feel so betrayed, and my hope is dwindling so much... it’s taking every ounce of my faith to not just give up. I still believe in Catholicism so much, but I have almost no help from others in showing my family what it means. They say such horrible things about it, and I try to show them otherwise, and then things like that Mass just confirm their suspicions. It could be years before they even consider taking the Church seriously again, if ever. I won’t give up my faith. But it honestly feels like God not only doesn’t care about what I feel or my intentions to bring my family closer to Christ, but openly mocks and derides me for it. I preferred the endless silence to that. I don’t know, maybe I just need to process the feeling of betrayal emotionally before I’m ready to handle it again intellectually. But thanks for listening anyway. I sincerely hope that all of you are having a much better Christmas. God bless you all!",a9ge8a,self.Catholicism,,True
My problems I was predestined to have with Calvinism,Catholicism,"I am posting this here because I've been a fan of this subreddit for a while. I'm not Catholic, but I suppose you'll appreciate this because I gather you're not really Calvin fans either. I guess I can fuel y'all's egos for a bit. I'm 19 years old, and I'm from the southeastern US. To protect my identity I won't get much more specific, but my family pretty much fits the 'WASP' stereotype perfectly. We've lived here for centuries, and my great uncle was a long-serving state governor. I say this because I want to point out that leaving this tradition is very difficult, and I wouldn't do it unless I was convinced we were wrong. I've been raised Presbyterian (PCA, not PCUSA) and staunchly Calvinist. My dad even went to Presbyterian seminary. I'm used to being an apologist for Calvinism, but I don't really believe what I'm saying anymore, and here's why: *how can you be judged for actions that God decided you would do?* It seems like such a simple question, but I can't answer it. Usually Calvinists defend this position by saying 'you still have free will, but it was set out that your free will would lead you that way.' But that makes no sense. If it was decided for you, you didn't choose it. The concept of sinful nature makes no sense if the very God that hates sin deliberately chose to give it to you. This makes God look like a corrupt policeman who plants drugs in your car. Sin is going against the purpose God has for us, right? So if God decided you were going to sin, then you could say your sin was his purpose. And if it was his purpose, then it wasn't sin! It's self-defeating. I don't know what I am anymore. I have deep respect for the Catholic tradition, but I have difficulty grasping several doctrines, like the Eucharist being the literal flesh and blood. This just seems falsifiable to me, though I mean no disrespect. Abandoning the Reformed tradition has sent me into a religious no-man's-land and I'm trying to piece some worldview together again.

Question of Homosexual Acceptance Advocacy,Catholicism,"Recently, in order to understand the teachings of the roman catholic church pertaining to homosexuality, I decided to refer to my copy of the 'Catechism of the Catholic Church'. Within 2357-2359 it describes homosexuality and to my surprise I found that in 2358 it mentions accepting homosexuals, but from my experience this isn't the case. What can we as Catholics do to try and be more inclusive? *'The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial.* ***They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.*** *These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.'* \-2358 from Catechism of the Catholic Church",a7hnmp,self.Catholicism,,True

Do you ever just drift in and out of faith?,Catholicism,"I'm in a bit of a rough patch spiritually at the moment, I just don't know what to believe.

Normally to reinforce my faith I like to read about the saints, but still I feel nothing. No God, no grace, nothing. I shouldn't listen to these things so I know I'm doing it to myself, but I don't know how to believe in God. What do I Do? Is there anything I should read to help? If anything at the moment I'm a deist because I don't see how this universe couldn't have been designed, but I also don't see why God wants to be worshipped in this particular way.

Why doesn't the Church create a new vocation -- that of “Presbyter”?,Catholicism,"Given the severe priest shortage in many parts of the world, I think the Church should consider creating a new ordained vocation -- that of “Presbyter” (I know what the word means -- if you have another, better name in mind, that would be fine too.) Further, even if there was no priest shortage, the total number of priests would obviously never be as large as the number of priests and presbyters combined. The Church and Her faithful need all the grace they can get. -- at all times. There is nothing that I can think of which would garner more grace from God than more Masses celebrated and more confessions heard. That takes more men that are able to administer these sacraments. My studies of the NT mention the Apostles (the proto-Bishops) and deacons. It says nothing about 'priests.' The vocation was created because there was a need -- as bishops couldn't be everywhere. A “Presbyter” would be a single male (or married if the Western priesthood ever allowed it) living and making his way in the world -- very much like permanent deacons of today. His focus would not be of 'service' as it is for deacons, but that of ordained sacramental minister. Like thousands of retired priests today, his focus would be on celebrating Masses and hearing confessions. While he would have the same sacramental abilities as a priest, he wouldn't be eligible for the bishopric or to be a pastor. His ministry could take him to anywhere more Masses and confessions are needed. From prisons and jails, to hospitals, cruise ships and overburdened parishes -- and those between pastors. This makes sense to me because the grace and authority needed to celebrate the Mass or give absolution are not gained from years of seminary. They are gifts from God. That's not to say that formation would be short or easy for “Presbyters.” It should be thorough -- rigorous and long, just *different* than today's seminary formation. I really see only three potential problems: * Many people resist change, ANY change. They have no appetite for new ideas/out-of-the box thinking. * It would have an impact on the celibate/seminary-formed priests, even if the roles of pastors and bishops were reserved to them, along with the title 'priest.' * Some existing permanent deacons would be upset, **even though each supposedly discerned a vocation as a permanent deacon, and not as a priest or a layman -- all 3 very distinct vocations.**",a3wf9d,self.Catholicism,,True

My Father Passed Today,Catholicism,"Cancer and chemo got the better of him after a year long battle. During his suffering he taught me things that changed my life and profoundly impacted my faith. I share these because hopefully they will have an impact on you and you can use them in your time of need. After his diagnosis and initial chemo, He told me “If this is what it takes to get to heaven, so be it.” This was a powerful surrender to God’s will. Here I was complaining about minor annoyances in life, while he embraced the cross of chemo slowly withering him away. Second he told me to always remember that God loves us to the point of madness. That God came in to the world and died due to this mad love that God has for each of us, even though sometimes it doesn’t feel like it. That God is always good and that his reward will come to all of us when we believe, no matter what he sends our way. He said to me “God will ask us for everything, and we must give it.” The longer I live the more I understand this, we must remember that we are pilgrims in this passing world and that our true future is the happiness of heaven. God is never late, he just asks to believe more, Enjoy the Christmas season, if you are with your family cherish your time and listen to their wisdom.

"One thing I noticed with some atheists, that absolutely infuriates me",Catholicism,"Since rediscovering the faith, I'm realizing that there is a very special but not uncommon type of atheist. The best example are my in-laws, though I've encountered people with similar mindsets. My in-laws are atheist to their bone. In several incidents they called Christians 'A\*Holes', 'stupid', 'hypocrites' and say, that religion is just an instrument of power to dumb people down. Here's the fascinating thing: – The say, humans are not made for monogamous relationships. Everybody should have the sex life he or she pleases. Yet they are together since decades, married and live a monogamous life. – They say there's nothing wrong with pornography. If that's what people like, than they should watch it. Yet, they themselves don't watch pornography. – They say Christmas is just an invention by whoever. But yet they celebrate Christmas (No church, no Jesus, no nativity. Just tree, presents and food). So here's a couple who lives a somewhat conservative or traditional lifestyle (and reaps the benefits of it, in my opinion), but suggests that the exact opposite would be equally good or even better. If I or anybody would take them seriously, there would be a big price to pay. Where does this schizophrenia (for lack a better word) come from?

Coming out as transgender to my Catholic sister,Catholicism,"I am a transgender man, which means that I was born female but at currently transitioning to male.

Is there any chance for me to preserve this relationship? Please refer to me with he/him pronouns, or at least avoid gendering me altogether.

Obviously the sisters would want me to use the women’s, but I look male and I don’t want to scare anyone. There are no gender neutral restrooms in the building (that I know of). Edit: Please don’t try to discuss why I’m transitioning, or call me mentally ill, or debate my gender, or try to talk me out of it. That’s a bit too much to go into with some strangers on Reddit.

[Free Friday] Favorite weird Summa Theologica quotes?,Catholicism,"Some of my favorite passages (emphases added): >Some have fallen into various errors about the matter of this sacrament. Some, known as the Artotyrytae, as Augustine says (De Haeres. xxviii), 'offer **bread and cheese** in this sacrament, contending that oblations were celebrated by men in the first ages, from fruits of the earth and sheep.' Others, called Cataphrygae and Pepuziani, 'are reputed to have made their Eucharistic bread with **infants' blood** drawn from tiny punctures over the entire body, and mixed with flour.' Others, styled Aquarii, under guise of sobriety, offer **nothing but water** in this sacrament. &#x200B; >On this way when a man eats or drinks much at the physician's advice in order to provoke vomiting, he is not to be deemed to have taken excessive meat or drink. There is, however, no need for intoxicating drink in order to procure vomiting, since this is **caused by drinking lukewarm water**: wherefore this is no sufficient cause for excusing a man from drunkenness. &#x200B; >If the priest be **stricken by death or grave sickness** before the consecration of our Lord's body and blood, there is no need for it to be completed by another. But if this happens after the consecration is begun, for instance, when the body has been consecrated and before the consecration of the blood, or even after both have been consecrated, then the celebration of the mass ought to be finished by someone else. &#x200B; >If a **fly or a spider** falls into the chalice before consecration, or if it be discovered that the **wine is poisoned**, it ought to be poured out, and after purifying the chalice, fresh wine should be served for consecration. But if anything of the sort happen after the consecration, the **insect should be caught carefully and washed thoroughly**, then **burned,** and the 'ablution,' together with the ashes, thrown into the sacrarium. If it be discovered that the wine has been poisoned, the priest should neither receive it nor administer it to others on any account, lest the life-giving chalice become one of death, but it ought to be kept in a suitable vessel with the relics &#x200B; >'If from neglect any of the blood falls upon a board which is fixed to the ground, let it be taken up with the tongue, and let the board be scraped. But if it be not a board, **let the ground be scraped, and the scrapings burned**, and the ashes buried inside the altar and let the priest do penance for forty days. But if a drop fall from the chalice on to the altar, **let the minister suck up the drop**, and do penance during three days; if it falls upon the altar cloth and penetrates to the second altar cloth, let him do four days' penance; if it penetrates to the third, let him do nine days' penance; if to the fourth, let him do twenty days' penance; and let the altar linens which the drop touched be washed three times by the priest, holding the chalice below, then let the water be taken and put away nigh to the altar.' >'They who do not keep proper custody over the sacrament, **if a mouse or other animal consume it**, must do forty days' penance: he who loses it in a church, or if a part fall and be not found, shall do thirty days' penance.'

The Miracles at the Birth of Christ according to St. Bonaventure,Catholicism," The miracles shown to the sinful nation at the time of the Nativity of Christ are these, according to various histories. First, a fulgent star appeared in the sky in parts of the East, which displayed the form of a most pure Infant, and over it was a shining cross to signify that He who was born would spread His doctrine, life and death throughout the whole world. Second, in the middle of the day from Capitoline Hill in Rome, a golden circle that appeared near the sun was seen – [also] by the Emperor and the Sibyl – and in it was a most pure Virgin giving birth to an Infant, signifying that He who was born was the Monarch of the world and came to demonstrate the splendor of the paternal glory and figure of His substance. Third, the temple of peace in Rome fell to the ground. When it was built, the devils were asked how long it would last, and they responded that it would stand until a Virgin gave birth to a Son, as a sign that He who was born would destroy the works and practices of vanity. Fourth, in Rome a large gush of oil sprung up from the ground and flowed into the Tiber, to show that a source of piety and mercy had been born. Fifth, on the night of the Nativity, the vinae Engaddi, from which perfume is made, sprouted, flourished, extended its branches and produced its scented liquid, to show that He who was born would make the spiritual world flourish, grow and give fruits, and that its fragrance would attract the whole world. Sixth, 30,000 criminals were killed by the Emperor, to show that He who was born would subject the whole world by His Faith and that the rebels would be lost in Hell. Seventh, all the sodomites in the whole world died, both male and female, according to Jerome commenting on the Psalm: The light was born for the just, which shows that He who was born came to reform nature and to promote chastity. Eighth, brute animals spoke in Judea, among them, two oxen, to make us understand that He who was born would transform the most bestial men into rational persons. Ninth, all the idols of Egypt were destroyed when the Virgin gave birth; according to Jeremiah that sign was given to the Egyptians to make them understand that He who was born was the true God and the only One worthy of adoration with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Tenth, when the Infant was laying in the Manger, the ox and donkey knelt before Him, as if they had reason, and adored Him, which makes us understand that He who was born would call both the Jews and the Gentiles to His religion. Eleventh, the whole world was in peace as described, to show that He who was born would love and promote universal peace and that His elect would enjoy eternal peace. Twelfth, in the East three suns appeared in the sky, which progressively merged into a single celestial body to show that by the birth of Christ the world would be informed of the Triune God, and that Divinity, spirit and flesh had been united in one Person. About all these things, our souls should bless God and venerate Him because He liberated us and His majesty was shown to us, a sinful nation. The Lord Jesus was born in the 5,199th year after the constitution of the world, after the constitution of the 750 gens of the City [of Rome], in the year of the 194th Olympics, in the 42nd year of Emperor Octavianus Augustus, in the 39th year of the reign of Herod of Ascalon in Judea, on the 8th day of the Kalendas of January, having Cyrenius as governor of Syria.

What is hell?,Catholicism,"A simple question, what is hell. For something so pivotal in the Catholic belief system I have rarely seen a consistent explanation of what exactly hell is and what it entails.

On the other I have explanations similar to the idea of the limbo of infants, being given knowledge of God and realising that they won't be with him, but no other torture. It seems really odd to me that we are being asked to make such a big decision on faith whilst not even having basic knowledge about the choices, how is that a just system by any measure? I've been told that no one who desires Heaven, even a little, will end up in hell and on the other hand being told that a Catholic dying in mortal sin will go to Hell (they certainly desire Heaven). I can't seem to find any consistent information about such a pivotal question and its really harming my faith whenever it comes up.

Marriage trouble,Catholicism,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Posting for advice. I feel like I am on the verge of leaving my new husband. He spit on me yesterday in the midst of a disagreement. He also went through my cell in front of his brother, while ranting about some Merry Christmas text that an old bf had sent (which I had not responded to, nor had I spoken to him in any kind of inappropriate way) and then threw my phone on the ground. The fight initially erupted because he was working alone late at the office Christmas Eve, which caused me to be so embarrassingly late to my families get-together, that I just skipped it, rather than go without my new husband and have to talk to my family about why he wasn't there. Last week when he was leaving for work in the am, he grew enraged over something I said and threw the bag of bread that he was eating at me. This is all made worse by my financial dependence on him. I left a decent job in a different state to marry him and be a homemaker, but now my efforts in homemaking are so degraded by him and I feel so fearful of raising a family around this, that I am contemplating abandoning this role altogether and returning to the work force. I am devastated and feel like my dreams of a happy marriage and children are over. He wants to do counseling, if I will. I feel like I have lost respect for him and attraction. Kind advice and prayer would be appreciated. I have been using so much marijuana to cope and i feel like I am in a pit with no way out. ",a9rgpe,self.Catholicism,,True

"Someday, my wife will be a Saint",Catholicism,"Background (I’m being vulnerable here, so please be kind): My wife has a mental illness that interrupts her life and sometimes requires big med adjustments in the hospital. Right now she is hospitalized, which has been a rollercoaster and has made me miss and appreciate her that much more. She is in a locked unit and has limited contact with the outside world. Anything considered dangerous for people on suicide watch (shoestrings, rosaries, mirrors, etc) is totally banned from the unit for good reason. &#x200B; Today she called me to tell me the story that I hope the world will hear when she gets canonized: a fellow patient in the unit is Catholic. The fellow patient is dealing with some cognitive decline and has trouble with things like setting up appointments, so my wife put in a request for her to talk to the chaplain. She (fellow patient) mentioned that she was sad because she couldn’t have a rosary. My wife grabbed a piece of paper and a marker and drew a rosary for her to use. The fellow patient loved it and shared it in excitement with others! When another patient saw it, she (the other patient) exclaimed how much she loved it, how she wanted to get in touch with her “spiritual side.” She asked my wife to draw a rosary for her as well. My wife did, and wrote the Our Father and Hail Mary on the back so that the other patient had a reference. &#x200B; 'The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.' My wife is kind enough and confident enough to share her faith while she herself is suffering, to walk with the people who need God the most, and to give herself in service to others when, from all appearances, she has very little left to give. &#x200B; Anyway, my wife reminded me of two things I thought I'd share: 1. Visiting the sick (and more generally walking with those who suffer) is an act of mercy, and we really should do it when we can; 2. I have literally no excuse for not taking the time to help others and do some evangelization today. I'll start by sharing this here and asking any of you who are visiting this sub to know that you are loved.",a50f88,self.Catholicism,,True

When you think that she has a history of promiscuity ...,Catholicism,"If we assume that a woman with a history of promiscuity will pretty much always turn out to be an adulterous wife, such marriage will sooner or later become impossible to continue. Adding insult to injury, as a man, you may very well be on the hook for alimony and/or child support, the extent of which depends on the legal system in your country. &#x200B; Hence, as a matter of great importance, you want to avoid marrying this type of woman. It is obviously better not to marry at all than to run a serious risk to end up with this kind of outcome. &#x200B; A related problem is that asking people to answer questions about themselves is useless. For example, if you ask someone, 'Are you a liar?', a truthful person will answer 'no', but a liar will also answer 'no'. Hence, you cannot use that answer to decide anything at all. Therefore, what people say about themselves is not a valid source of information. &#x200B; With the levels of promiscuity going through the roof nowadays, and with the incredible difficulty to determine who is promiscuous and who isn't, marriage has become part of a class of unreasonably dangerous behaviour. The marriage rate is dropping rapidly, and nay saying has now become the norm. &#x200B; The effects are obviously also very visible on the birth rate. We are not sure that western society will even survive this situation. &#x200B; Priests do not marry. Hence, I assume that other men do not need to marry either. Still, besides not marrying at all, what survival strategy does the Catholic Church propose? Is there a viable modus operandi for marriage, in this very dangerous environment of rampant promiscuity?",a7u67f,self.Catholicism,,True

Things that I don't understand as a Catholic,Catholicism,"&#x200B; Hi :). I'm a convert (about 1 year old now) and still have some questions and things I'm wondering about. Since I'm generally a bit too anxious and since Advent has come I thought I'd try to answer some of my questions about Catholicism and thus rid myself of some of my anxieties. 1) What exactly is our teaching about the Second Coming? A lot of the Gospels seem very weird on it since they say 'some of you standing here will not perish until you see all of this coming' and that's odd. And I've heard that our reading of Revelation is mostly 'it happened in the past' but then why does it open by saying that John was shown 'the things which are to come' and if it happened in the past but after what John was writing why are we still waiting for the Second Coming? I also know that Milleniarism is condemned, but then what is our view? I know I'm highly oversimplifying this but you get the idea. &#x200B; 2) A lot of Paul's letters make be uncomfortable. A lot of it seems to conflict with our theological idea of baptism and some of his criticisms of the Jewish view of circumcision could be applied to Baptism &#x200B; 3) Some of the stuff in Hebrews about the sacrifice for sins being only once and the old sacrifices having no power (hence why they had to be repeated) also sounds uncanny for our Eucharistic theology. &#x200B; 4) What exactly constitutes grave matter? &#x200B; 5) Why are all (or basically) all sins against the 6th commandment mortal? &#x200B; 6) I kind of thought this through and it came to my mind that if we're serious about being Catholic there's an argument to be made for all of us being vegan. Basically the Church didn't very strongly condemn a lot of things through history although she did condemn them in some shape or form (think slavery). Since the Cathecism says that causing unnecessary pain to animals or killing them without a just reason is contrary to human dignity (or something like that) shouldn't all modern humans in the developed world be vegan since currently the killing is not necessary and most of the diary industry is cruel?

Why Saint Peter as first Pope and not Saint John?,Catholicism,"I have been thinking about this question all day. Why did Jesus choose Saint Peter and not Saint John as the first Pope? It is clear that John is the most loved apostle, the most pure, perhaps the holiest. Saint John was even deemed worthy to receive the Virgin Mary into his care. Contrasted to Peter, a man who failed over and over again. A man who was rough and somewhat uncultured. A man we can all relate to. I feel like there has to be a deeper meaning here.

Non-Catholic marriage seminar issues,Catholicism,"This is a throwaway but I am a regular-ish contributor. My husband and I have had a somewhat rocky marriage. His main gripe with me being me not initiating intercourse enough and being indifferent about sex in general. We have sex at least three times a week which is more than enough for me but not enough for him. He tries to pressure me into things I'm not willing to do e.g. anal sex. We are young but we have three children. My gripes are that he is a video game addict, watches a lot of pornography (both of which he says is my fault although those issues predate our relationship by over ten years), does not do anything at home other than computer/TV and takes little interest in his children. He pretty much completely lost interest in our religion as soon as we married (so as far as I can tell it was mostly a pretense. He seems to only care about the faith when he can point to it to justify the man being the head of the house, me being obliged to serve him etc.) Sorry for all the TMI. ANYWAY. A few months ago he watched this marriage seminar online  he thought it was great and had me watch it too. It's extremely long, I'm not expecting anyone to watch it all. The man is some kind of pastor but I'm not sure what denomination. &#x200B; I think there's a few useful things and funny observations and the guy seems nice and all but ultimately I didn't really like the message and so much of it just rubs me up the wrong way, like the voice he puts on when he imitates women. I know it's meant to be light hearted but ugh. I think it might demonstrate what he really thinks about women and it's not good. I think it's just giving men an excuse for bad behavior (which is why my husband liked it - their brains are just SO different, they cant be expected to ever think of others or do anything without explicit instructions and a ton of praise, they \*need\* hours and hours of alone time etc.) and telling women they need to adapt to suit men more than the other way around. The main thing (that has been causing arguments in our home) is the part where he says that wives should offer husbands sex in exchange for specific things they want their husband to do because sex is the main (or even only) motivator in men's lives. I accept that sex is a transactional thing in a broad sense but I don't think it's healthy or godly for it to be explicitly a matter of 'I do this chore and you do this sexual favour tonight'. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to do sometimes (negotiate with sex), like a cute flirty thing you do occasionally but don't think it should be the primary approach. But that is what my husband wants and keeps referring back to this video as some kind of unquestionable evidence that I have to 'reward' him for some minor chore that I do 99% of the time myself without any fanfare. Like I have to follow this random, not even Catholic dude's instructions or my husband will just go back to treating me and the children like garbage most of the time. &#x200B; So things blew up a little today. We were coming back from eating out with all the children, he's been relatively nice and patient with them lately. I had mentioned him dropping me at the grocery store so I could pop in to get something for our kindergartner's packed lunch tomorrow. He missed the turn so he just said 'f\*\*\* it' and kept on towards home. I wasn't happy about that because I'm still going to have to go back out and get what we need, all he had to do was do a u-turn for goodness sake but it wasn't a huge deal to me. I'd just go back out after the kids' bedtime. To be fair when he saw my mood had changed he asked what was up and I did tell him that it's a bit annoying to be almost at the place I need to go and then not get to go because of his small mistake. So he was like 'Ok you really want to go to the store?' and he turned back around. I held his hand and said thanks. Then he asked 'will this make you happy?' in a baby voice and I nodded but internally I'm rolling my eyes because it's not like I just looove to go shopping for babybels and crackers but he's acting like he's doing me a huge favour. But as I say, I just nodded and smiled. Not three seconds later he says 'Soooo am I gonna get a BJ later?' I groan and he's like 'what??' and I just went quiet. Then he tells me 'I think we need to watch that marriage video again'. I roll my eyes for real this time and then he demands to know what my issue is. I was quiet for a while because I didn't want to get into it but eventually I told him I thought the video wasn't that great and I don't like sex being a transactional thing in that way. He tells me I'm wrong and I'm a jerk etc. and 'I've been so nice to you lately because of that lecture. Do you want to go back to having a shitty marriage again?' He has been doing more helpful things lately and we have been having slightly more sex but I really am not liking this 'what am I going to get for this?' any time he does anything for us. I find it quite demeaning to be honest and really disliking this pastor (Mark Gungor) for giving my husband justification for treating me like this. Can I just get some objective input here?

We had a lesson over prayer, and there was nothing there about the types of prayer, how to pray or even intercessory prayer, which, coming from a Protestant background, is a huuuuge departure from the (my?) norm.

As the title suggests, she received Baptism and Confirmation in the Church, but shortly after Confirmation she defected into some vague brand of Protestantism (likely because she was not being spiritually fed by our parish and Catholic high school), and she is now engaged to a very kind gentleman who, as far as I can tell, is a baptized Protestant. She booked a wedding venue in some barn somewhere and has no plans of getting a dispensation from the bishop, neither will she seek to raise any of her kids Catholic.

They were saying that they don’t want me going to that church anymore. It’s nothing against my friend, they know her and like her. They said that I’m going against the Catholic church and throwing away all the sacraments I have received. Am I really doing that? Am I truly committing a sin?

The lord of snows upreared his head; His mantle long and pale Upon the bitter blast was spread And hung o’er hill and dale. The world was blind, the boughs were bent, All ways and paths were wild: Then the veil of cloud apart was rent, And here was born a Child. The ancient dome of heaven sheer Was pricked with distant light; A star came shining white and clear Alone above the night. In the dale of dark in that hour of birth One voice on a sudden sang: Then all the bells in Heaven and Earth Together at midnight rang. Mary sang in this world below: They heard her song arise O’er mist and over mountain snow To the walls of Paradise, And the tongue of many bells was stirred in Heaven’s towers to ring When the voice of mortal maid was heard, That was mother of Heaven’s King.

I feel like a horrible person because I'm not looking forward to crowds of strangers on Christmas,Catholicism,"Yes, I know it's a wonderful thing that they're there at Mass. We need more Catholics going to Mass! I really, truly hope some of them are so touched by the Mass that they start coming more regularly or are inspired to take their faith seriously again. I'll be praying for them in the coming days and my intention for Christmas Mass will be for all the visitors there-- that they might return to practicing. That said, I'm an introvert and I like my routine. I'm not looking forward to probably having to sit in a strange pew next to strangers or possibly not getting to greet Father after Mass and wish him a Merry Christmas because too many people will want to talk to him. I'm not looking forward to probably not being able to see because there will be too many people. I'm going to *try* to go to the Midnight Mass (I'm usually falling asleep by 9:30), but our 4:30 Mass will have an overflow Mass in the school gym.

I hate that I have these uncharitable, selfish feelings. It's especially bothering me as a Franciscan. A Franciscan should *volunteer* to go to the gym so the guests can experience the beautiful church. A Franciscan should be overjoyed by being pushed out of their normal spot and having their view blocked by strangers who spend half the Mass on their phone. I'm a terrible Franciscan. Sorry for the rant, it's just bothering me a lot. Edit--- I'll add I just got back from confession and I brought this up to Father. He told me it was entirely normal to feel uncomfortable with unfamiliar people in 'our' space and that it's only once or twice a year and I should try to pray for them. He also told me I have a good reputation in the parish and I need to be an example to the people coming in for the holiday. Then he slipped me a present (an Our Lady of Guadalupe pin) through the grate. He's adorable.",a8nbic,self.Catholicism,,True

Some questions about hell/heaven,Catholicism,"Recently I saw some information relating to the 'fewness of the saved' and its given me some troubling questions/thoughts. From my admittedly limited understanding, if you die in a state of mortal sin you will not be saved. Doesn't this mean that the vast majority of people are going to hell? To me this seems unbelievable for a few reasons. People are highly influenced by their surroundings. Take for example this experiment:  Most people will conform to the group on basic parts of society like fashion, music, sports etc. All things that we can actually see and know exist. How do you expect people to rationally diverge from the majority group opinion on something as complex and unknowable as religion? People are naturally inclined to act with the group and follow majority opinion, especially of experts. This is undeniably a part of human nature. If our very nature, the way we were created, makes it nearly impossible for your average person to act in accordance with the conditions necessary for salvation, how is this a just system? It seems to me that instilling a fear of standing out, an innate desire to follow the group and a dislike for those deviating from the group, but then necessitating deviation from the group to not be eternally tortured is only something that could be done with malicious intent. Someone simply being placed in the 'wrong' society could lead to them being eternally damned, how is this fair? It does nothing to measure whether they were kind, compassionate or caring for their fellow man, just their propensity to deviate from social norms. Judging people by a rigorous set of rules whilst creating them with innate desires that go against those rules doesn't seem to me like the work of a loving father. It seems like its purposefully set up to cause people to fail. If I lived the entirety of my life as a devout Catholic but mortally sinned in the last day of my life without confessing I would be eternally damned according to church teaching right? Again, this doesn't seem like the actions of someone who loves me. I would really appreciate some help on this issue because its really damaging my faith. Its understandable to me that the thought of everyone I love and know to be a good person being eternally tortured because they didn't follow the rules passed down in a thousand year old book would be concerning. Just to be clear, I am not trying to be rude or anti-catholic in any way, I am simply trying to find answers to questions which are harming my faith. I want to believe and follow God.

A few days ago I got the sudden and completely random urge to learn to pray the Rosary. Now something weird is happening...,Catholicism,"As per my title, a few days ago completely out of the blue I got it into my head that I 'must' learn to pray a Rosary. Bear in mind, none of my immediate family are Catholics and if anything religion is just one of those subjects that isn't really a thing for us. I myself consider myself a pagan, which makes this whole thing even weirder. But the strangest thing is that I'm now at a point where I've now said a rosary each day (following a recording) and have in about 2 days memorised most of the prayers needed (still working on the Salve Regina) as well as the mysteries for each day. It's got to a point now where now I think each day that I *need* to pray a rosary, and get quite excited about doing it. Actually saying the prayers is even better. I've also noticed an effect when I read the Bible. It used to be the case even when I was a strong Baptist that reading Scripture was hard for me. When I left Baptist Christianity, I ended up getting rid of my Bible and vowed I'd likely never read it again. But on another whim I bought a Catholic Bible and even with the few times I've read it, it's a totally different experience- I now actively enjoy reading it, and I also discovered happily that my Ecclesiastical Latin isn't dead yet either. I really don't even know what to make of any of this... ",a4k8b3,self.Catholicism,,True

Seriously pained by the fact that so many people have 'lost their way' when it comes to God and Catholicism. I've lost my peace. What should I do?,Catholicism,"I know so many Catholics who know so little about the faith. I know so many Catholics who do not practice the faith. I see know so many Catholics who live worldly lives (sex and drugs). I know a lot of Catholics who disagree with many teachings of the Church (on sex, drugs and homosexuality). I know a number of people who have fallen for atheism and skepticism. Seeing all this, I just feel the need to do something. In fact, I want to write a book for the youth in my country and help them see God, but it is not easy work. In the meantime, my heart seriously throbs with pain and frustration because so many people are lost, and because so many people continue to offend God who loves us so much and even gave up his life for us. How is that fair? Right now, I have lost my peace. I am so eager to write a book that takes time. My mind is always thinking about writing it, what I can add and the great effort it will take to complete the work. I just want so badly to make a difference but of course, my capacity is so limited. I love God so much, it pains me that his Church and his children (including my Dad, as well as many of my cousins and friends who I care about deeply) are in bad shape. I really do not want anyone to go to hell but it seems like so many people are headed in that direction. I am also frustrated by the fact that popular culture (the media and Hollywood) are so against Christ and his Church. How can we expect people to find God in such an environment? How can we also expect people to come to Christ when the appeal of sex is so strong and powerful? Is there even hope for society at large to return to Christ at this point? Anyway this eagerness and frustration that I feel, I, at least today and yesterday, has caused me my peace. My mind throbs due to eagerness, frustration and thinking about all this. I have lost many hours of sleep. It is quite funny but awhile ago, this pain and frustration bothered me so much that I had to take heavy breaths for about 2-3 hours. Does anybody here experience similar struggles? How do you deal with it? To those who cannot really relate with my experience, how do you think I should deal with this?

The Bible Seems to Dispute Perpetual Virginity,Catholicism,"Mark 6:3 >Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?' And they took offense at him. Hey, guys. I’ve been a staunch Catholic for a few years now, but I’m shaken up on arguments against the doctrine of Mary’s perpetual virginity. Everything in the Bible seems to point out that Mary had children after Jesus was born. From the many verses that list their names, to the one in Matthew were it says Joseph did not consummate the marriage *until* after Jesus was born. I just can’t find anything that supports Catholic claims. I know we like to say that they were Joseph’s children from a previous marriage, but that seems like grasping at straws. Really. That or we fall back on “It’s Tradition,” which I respect, but that is a pretty weak argument on its own. Also it wasn’t until the 4th century that even some portions of Christians started believing in perpetual virginity, as noted by St. Jerome. Doesn’t that sound like it could’ve been a pious belief that developed among an eager lay populace over the course of 300 years? I’d love to hear anything you guys have for me. And if you try and bring up apocryphal sources, that’s fine, but why wouldn’t God’s Word include just a little bit of clarity here? It even uses words like “Joseph knew her not until after she gave birth to Jesus” which sound suggestive of intercourse occurring at some point later. ",a8e5f2,self.Catholicism,,True

It's my understanding that you all believe that the Orthodox Church has 'valid sacraments.'

If this is the case, then why would I, as an Orthodox Christian, ever consider entering the Roman communion?

Do you do things during Mass that might upset hyper holier-than-thou Catholic Christians?,Catholicism,"A recent discussion about the article *Things You Should Not Do At Mass (But You Might Be Doing Anyhow)* made me reflect on the things I do during Mass that might upset some hyper holier-than-thou Catholics. The list is longer than I imagined: * **I pray Morning Prayer before Mass with the aid of a small tablet.** I also use the tablet for the readings. * **I listen to Catholic music up until Mass begins and immediately after it ends via ear buds.** This totally blocks out the horrendous din that's common in my parish, before and after Mass. The music has been a Godsend. * **I discreetly listen to Catholic music via ear buds if either of my parish's two deacons preach.** I've had my fill listening to heretical and nonsensical homilies written by their wives. If my pastor doesn't have enough respect for those in the pews to censor the deacons, I have my personal solution. I don't know how many times peoples have angrily asked me about the contents of one of their questionable homilies after Mass and all I could do is shrug my shoulders. * **I always hold a small handcross during Mass.** I have long held a small handcross given to me by my former Eastern Catholic pastor during both Mass and the Divine Liturgy. * **I often wear nice Bermuda shorts to Mass.** Thomas Aquinas himself said we must be as comfortable as possible when we pray. * **I keep my eyes closed through Mass -- except when reading of course.** This began back in the days of massive liturgical abuses. I simply didn't want to watch all the crap going on. Now that things have changed years later, I find it difficult to keep my eyes open. * **I discreetly chew gum and drink water during Mass.** Both greatly help me to sing better. * **I cross the Gospel reading in my missalette with my thumb before I cross my forehead, lips and heart.** * **I keep my hands in the 'Albrecht Dürer Praying Hands' posture during the praying of the Lord's Prayer.** * **I kneel following the** ***Agnus Dei,*** **along with a tiny minority before rising to take communion.** * **I fail to make the Roman/Hitler posture.** I don't extend my arm when 'praying over' the EMsHC to the home bound after Mass.

I recently graduated university in the spring, and now student loans are due . . . roughly $1,000 per month for 10 years with about 100,000k due total. Technically about 70k of that is money my parents took out, but they expect me to pay it all back myself. My parents will let me stay with them to save rent, but not much else. My degree is a liberal art degree so I'm competitive for at most a 40k-45k salary right now. &#x200B; Now I know what you're probably thinking: this kid is dumb, like really dumb. I was really hesitant to take out so much dept, but my family is terrible at financial planning. My mother suffers from extreme anxiety regarding money, so I could never talk to her about paying for college without her freaking out and saying she's broke (we are not broke btw, upper middle class). My stepfather on the other hand just didn't care about it. Needless to say, this made it really easy to avoid financial planning and just throw out loans at 7% interest. &#x200B; Here's the thing, I went to university full well knowing that I would have to go back to school to increase my earnings. I was planning for med school and then go through the military to pay for it. Unfortunately I would now need to reapply next summer because my MCAT scores last summer just couldn't cut it. This means that I would not get into med school until Fall 2020. Even worse, the payments won't stop for the 70k when I reenter school because it's technically MY PARENTS debt. So I would have to go to school AND pay $800/month just in loans! &#x200B; So right now I am looking at staying with my parents for the next two years, which is . . . not great. I love my parents, but there is some serious cramping issues that sometimes makes our relationship difficult. I would love to make it on my own as a man, but I can't with cost of living being so high and $1,000 leaving my wallet every month. I can't afford going to normal grad school without taking more loans (which I refuse to do) or joining the military which is also a huge commitment. God forbid I even consider starting a family with this much debt right now, meanwhile most of my friends are currently getting married. They and the rest of my family except for my parents are 3,000 miles back east, so no support there. &#x200B; I don't regret going to university. It was completely my choice and I am better off for it as a person. The knowledge, wisdom, and relationships I gained are invaluable. If the price-tag for that comes out to 100k then so be it; I wish I just knew what to do. I have been working with my friend who is a financial adviser, but his advice has been limited. My parents are completely flippant about the whole thing because THEY'RE not paying for it. Meanwhile I am very scared about my financial future. I'm only 22 but I don't feel like I can even start my life. My faith is the only thing keeping me at peace in this whole situation. &#x200B; Again I hope this isn't inappropriate for this sub, I just don't know what to do.",a7qred,self.Catholicism,,True

How can anyone believe that they belong to the ' (I understand that so much of religion in general is about having faith and believing without seeing) What causes any Catholic, Jew, Muslim or anyone at all to believe that their religion is the correct one; to be followed by all people on earth? Why does anyone individual believe it is their responsibility (or the responsibility of all the church) to convert others to their views? Should they not focus more on encouraging others to live moral lives to the best of that individual's judgment and not to their own being that no one person's interpretation of what is just can be correct for only God knows the truth? It seems that attempting to convert instead of encouraging to merely live righteously is an entirely wasted effort for nothing is accomplished unless that person converts, whereas just urging others to live morally will likely have a greater impact. &#x200B; In the case of Muslims, Christians of all denominations, and Jews, they all believe in the same god, just different ways of reaching that god. Why is a Catholic's interpretation of how to reach God and the afterlife more correct than any other religion? &#x200B; There are plenty of atheists who live moral lives while also believing it has no barring on what happens to them after they die.

If I miss Mass for a bad reason, the punitive church uses it's authority to condemn that person to hell. Abusive child molesters go to heaven if the go to confession. I believe that God is a merciful God, and that rules like this are a power play on the part of the church, to scare the flock into conforming. With that said, I'm sure that abusive behavior has been going on since Augustine saw a cross in the sky before a battle and proclaimed Christianity to become the official religion of the Roman Empire. It was accepted back then that older men often took young men as lovers. I, unfortunately, was almost molested by a priest. Some of my first communion friends were. I found this out a few years ago.

Question from a potential convert (Protestant),Catholicism,"Long post. Sorry for the ramble. So my friends on this Sub. I have been reading and learning about the Catholic faith for about a year on this sub. My background is Anglican then a non Denominational Protestant church. A couple of years ago I kind of lost my faith in the church I was attending. Too many holes in theology and not enough valid answers. Long story short, I started looking for a new church - and while Protestantism is where I’m from, the 30,000 flavours, and the fact a new church pops up as soon as there’s a disagreement made it hard for me to really feel settled. I did what I think a lot of people have done, and went back to read the early history of the Church and the Church Elders - and realized that maybe Orthodox/Catholic churches might be on to something. (Understatement, I know). I ruled out Orthodoxy for a couple of reasons, the biggest one being the split along ethnic lines, but also because of a couple other things i wasn’t comfortable with. I’ve turned my full attention to Catholicism - reading as many books as I can, listening to podcasts, watching lectures, all in an effort to know more. I have this burning desire to digg deeper, and it’s unlike anything I have experienced before. I can’t get enough. I’ve been to Mass, (Novus Ordo) and found it beautiful and simple. But I have a few concerns. And while I’m not expecting anyone to provide me a perfect answer, I would love to learn more about things. First Question. As a learn more about Catholicism, I’m starting to see that there are some fractures within the church. Traditional vs Modern, certain factions following different cardinals, Sedevacantists, People who would prefer the church stay locked into the past, etc. It would seem that under the umbrella of Catholicism, your church is experiencing the same challenges that Protestant church’s face. Mainly, disagreement causing sects. If Catholicism is truly the universal church, how do you explain all of the infighting? And the lack of support from some sectors for the Pope? Is he not Peters successor? What grounds, or logic is at play here? Is seems a bit heretical to an outsider. If you truly believe in The Pope, then by rights, why are people not more supportive of him? Second Question - Mary and the Saints - I’m sure this is the most common question us Protestants have, but I’m struggling here. Help me understand how this isn’t crossing the line into idolatry. Any resources, reading material, etc would be greatly appreciated. I’m trying to understand and come to grips with it. But it’s not going so well. Thanks in advance for your help.

Thought experiment:,Catholicism,"Please read each step by itself without skipping ahead: 1. Imagine a polka-dotted elephant in your mind. 2. The moment it comes, 'pops' into your mind, notice what it's doing. Where is it's trunk? What direction is it looking? Is it big or small? What colors are it's polka-dots? 3. Once you you mentally noticed all that data, think of something else. Anything. Maybe do a math problem. 4. Where was the elephant before he 'popped' into your mind? Where was he when you saw him? Where did he go when he 'popped' out? The elephant might have come from and went to the same 'place' of 'non-existence' but while he was in your mind, he was not, at least, in the exact 'same kind' of 'non-existence.' 5. Now, explore within yourself, how would you like to describe the differences of when the elephant was in your mind and when he wasn't? They were qualitatively different, right? Very much so, right? When you weren't thinking of anything visual and suddenly BAM visual, than it left. Birth, Life, and Death. 6. Sit with that for a bit. 7.

Sure, you might've gone those from some arbitrary memory....but you never saw a polka-dotted elephant (or I'd be really surprised!) ....where did you get the colors for the dots? You didn't consciously choose those colors before hand...so where did they come from? READ FROM THE TOP ONLY DOWNWARD. When you imagine the elephant...only you can see it. If I tried to see it, I would only see neurons firing in your brain, right? I would not see the elephant, only chemicals or electrons. But you see the elephant. Only you.

Struggling with porn and it’s affecting girlfriend,Catholicism,"Hi everyone. I’ve struggled with porn for a few years, it’s gotten a lot better recently but I confided in my girlfriend that I relapsed the other day. She doesn’t want to break up with me, she’s a fellow Christian (I’m not fully catholic) but it’s affecting her self worth. Any tips on dealing with this? I’ve told her that it’s not about her and she’s one reason I’m able to quit and get better. But she can’t control how she feels and she says she hates that she doesn’t look like the girls in porn.

Has anyone here ever had a priest bless their home or car? Was it helpful?,Catholicism,"I'm a little embarrassed to ask and seem superstitious but I would like to have our apt Blessed. I'm not sure how to go about doing that. My mom did it for her new car, but she's very involved with the church and I wouldn't want a priest I didn't know to well to feel like he's going out of his way. I love my apt, it's large, in a great location and affordable, but a few things have happened there that make me want to be safe and just spiritually cleanse and bless it. 1) We had a huge infestation of mold, that has since been remediated in the bedroom, it occurred from the basement level through the floorboards in the master bedroom and our child's room and spread to all the bedroom furniture. We had to evacuate for a month while it was being fixed. This happened within 1 year of moving in. 2) My husband tends to get inexplicable aches. He's had a terrible backache that required that he get X-rays for, it resolved on its own but was never explained. He recently got inexplicable vertigo that resulted in a hospital visit. 3) In my bedroom I get frequent bad dreams. About once a week. I also get the occasional terrifying sleep paralysis. I once had a sleep paralysis where I woke up unable to move and felt a presence in the other side of the room, I heard something speaking incoherently over our fan, almost hissing. I was finally able to move and woke my husband up telling him 'There's something in the room with us.' He just brushed it off because he doesn't like to think about these kinds of things.

The way we talk about sin.,Catholicism,"There have been a lot of posts lately asking for advice and prayers to avoid a particular sin. I think these are great and represent one of the best things about this community. &#x200B; I also think we need to be careful in how we discuss our sin with others. We often use terms like 'fell into' or 'it happened'. My concern is that by saying 'I fell into >sin>' we are diverting the fault and treating it as if it were something that just happened to us rather than something we actively chose. I think this puts us in a less powerful position to combat the sin and make ourselves better. I think this is especially true when we discuss vices and recurrent sin. We don't fall into drunkenness, we make an active choice to drink. We don't fall into pornography. We make an active choice to seek it out. &#x200B;",a89vc0,self.Catholicism,,True

Debunking Centuries of Anti-Catholic History,Catholicism,I am reading a book right now called 'bearing false witness: debunking centuries of anti-catholic history' by Rodney Stark Anyways I am reading this book it's pretty good. He is a protestant...and a historian and his claim is he is trying to correct history in the sense that he takes anti catholic rumors or stories that have been shared in history researches them and tells the true history of it. Anyways my question that I have. While reading this he was talking about the vatican library. Which made me think of a rumor that I was told when I wasn't Catholic. I was told that the vatican has a vault that is miles long of historical documents that only certain people are allowed in. Rumor I was told: ' the Catholics have the gospel of Peter in the vatican vault and wont let anyone read it because it proves that the catholic church is the church of lies or church of the devil and is deceiving millions of people. Which fulfills the prophesy in Matthew 24 about how even the elite will be deceived.' I personally dont really believe that there is a book or document that proves the catholic church wrong and no one is allowed to read it. I feel that is just conspiracy. But I am curious on more information about the vault or vatican library...I have seen the davinci code with Tom Hanks I'm wondering what the true story of the library is and who is actually allowed in there.

What is your theodicy?,Catholicism,"How do you make sense of the existence of natural evil when God has omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence? I've already been convinced by a combination of the Irenæan theodicy and the free-will hypothesis, so basically to me the only two problems of evil I still wrestle with are 1. animals experiencing suffering and death due to natural means and 2. human infants experiencing suffering and death due to natural means. Like a newborn human baby getting cancer. Or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Or spontaneous abortion/stillbirth/lithopedionism. Or all birth defects. These things are not caused by free-will-agents, and they are not happening to creatures that can benefit from suffering (C.S. Lewis said that animals cannot be improved by suffering, therefore Irenæus' theodicy cannot extend to animals and human infants), so it seems strange that God allows them.",a8330c,self.Catholicism,,True
Drugs?,Catholicism,"For the record, I've never done any sort of recreational drugs (including alcohol and tobacco). I'm 16 years old and some of the kids I know have at some point used cannabis (mostly in the form of edibles at parties). My questions have less to do with peer pressure then you probably think right now. Currently, it is permissible under the CCC to drink and smoke in moderation (even though smoking is incredibly harmful). It is not permissible to do consume any sort of illegal drugs because breaking just laws is bad. Cannabis is not legal on a federal level in the U.S., but is in Canada. There are strains of cannabis with varying levels of potency. The CCC says that consuming stupefying drugs is a sin. Thus, it is sinful to get drunk even though drinking alcohol in moderation isn't. Why should taking one puff of a low potence strain of marijuana cigarette (once in while) be sinful? One could argue that it's easier to moderate alcohol, but I believe that the responsibility lies on the individual to dose correctly. Of course, I'm assuming that all this is in a place where marijuana is legal. Heroin, cocaine, and meth are obviously bad so I'm not going to talk about them. On to LSD and 'shrooms. Obviously, taking a full dose leads to loss of control and reason, which is a sin (I'm mildly salty about this one because I've always wanted to experience a psychedelic high once in my life, just for the fun of it). But what about microdosing? One can't actually trip from a microdose, and if one does it once in a while there shouldn't be any ill effects. Is it really that different from relaxing with a couple of beers? Of course, LSD is illegal the U.S and Canada, but for argument's sake let's pretend it isn't. I think there would be a lot of objections from a social pov (just as people would be objecting if alcohol was legalized in a country where it was previously illegal) but not as many from a theological one.

The Liturgy of the Hours is such a stumbling block to me,Catholicism,"I like how it's easy to pray and friendly to laity and busy parish priests, and I don't necessarily mind a 30-day Psalter even if it's not ideal. But this whole thing where three whole Psalms were excised and dozens of verses removed because of 'psychological difficulties' (in other words, muh feelings) bothers me so much. I wouldn't mind it otherwise but this butchery is inexcusable. The Church used to pray the entire Psalter every week, and even if doing it once a month may not be the idea it should at least be the entire Psalter and not a censored version of it. And it gives me an aversion to the idea of pursuing a religious vocation in a mainstream order because it pricks my conscience so hard knowing I'd be praying an incomplete Psalter. I know there are priests and religious who agree with me about this, and not even necessarily ideological traditionalists.

VERY CONTROVERSIAL: God's omnipotence,Catholicism,"This post is an attempt to answer the problem of evil. Is God's omnipotence infallible doctrine? Because this the way I see it: God is obviously very powerful. And I *need* to believe He is omniscient and omnibenevolent. An all-knowing and all-loving being is absolutely central to Christianity, and Christianity (specifically Catholicism, obviously) is as good as proved true in my opinion. But it is my belief that He is not omnipotent. A truly and fully omnipotent being would be able to break the laws of logic and create creatures with free will, but simultaneously cause them to choose to do good. An omnipotent being would be able to break the laws of logic and cause a creature to become perfect, without the creature needing to suffer one iota. An omnipotent being would be able to break the laws of logic and make a world with free natural processes that somehow has no natural disasters, animal attacks, or disease. And a truly and fully omnipotent being would not need to die on the cross for our sins. He could just snap His fingers and say 'It is finished.' Actually, He wouldn't even need to snap His fingers, He could just think it and have it be done. Actually He wouldn't even need to do that... Therefore, I believe that God is capable of doing anything. However, He is not capable of doing anything by just any means. He has processes He has to work with, and methods He needs to use. He made the world and life using the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and evolution. It didn't just happen. He can wipe out every living thing, using water. It didn't just happen. He can make a virgin conceive by editing the physically existing chromosomes (and things I do not understand). It didn't just happen. He can become incarnate by being born of a woman, it didn't just happen. He can forgive our sins by dying for us, it didn't just happen. He reveals His nature and plans to people such as Moses by revelation. They didn't just know. In the same way, He gave us the Bible by having human scribes write it down, it didn't just come into existence. He can make us perfect by process of Purgatory, it doesn't just happen. You get baked bread by baking it. It doesn't just happen. Therefore (provided that Adam and Eve did sin), there was absolutely no ~~other~~ better way for our salvation to take place other than the exact way it did, on the timeline it did. God *can* do anything but not by just any means or by no means at all. He must work within certain boundaries, and use certain methods. He uses His omniscience to know what those means are. So this is the second-best possible world. I would love to be wrong about this, and to find that there was something I was overlooking, and that there is an obvious explanation for how the traditional trio of attributes are logically compatible with the existence of natural evil. Tear apart my arguments, put forth your own, tear apart one another's arguments. Give varying answers to the problem of evil, check for heresy, etc. etc. Whatever you like.

Marian feast day, what could go wrong? After all, the TLM community has taken quite the toll on me and my depression lately, and it would be nice to get to know Catholics who actually lived here. All nice and well, right? Well, among the people flocking to the church was someone carrying a guitar. Ok, that was to be expected. No biggie. Hand-copied song book with cheerful childrens songs. Ok. Mass starts with the usual colloquial sentences that sort of contain the liturgical key words woven in. The songs start getting more shout-y with tambourine claps. It turned out that the man in the golden robe who had talked most of the time wasn't the actual priest - who only spoke the gospel and the transsubstantiation. However, golden-robe-man goes on to deliver the homily about immaculate conception - what obviously means the 'flawless concept' God has of *EVERYONE* and how we all consist of a flawless image, only that sin sometimes gives us the impression that we aren't perfect, but always remember that God sees us as perfect and wholesome, guys! And now let's pray for more women standing up and changing things in the community like Mary. For Men and Women to finally achieve equality in the Church. That Men discover their feminine qualities of receptiveness in order to accept Gods message of everyone being perfect. Cue increasingly more exciting tambourine clapping in the songs. The sign of peace, thought it was all nice and done after briefly greeting the lady before and behind me, only to find out that golden-robe.man, after everyone was done, meandered through the church to greet everyone *personally* (the 2yo was very excited about this).

I was just silently signing him *no* when suddenly the bunch of people who had moved out the pews in order to get in line TURNED AROUND, because the communion distributors decided to position themselves directly next to the exit. 'Are we going home?', the son asked with increased confusion, quickly turning into '... I want to go home.' I might mention that it was supposed to be a children's mass, and besides of mine there was a grand total of two children there.

If mom is going to mass and the children are receiving sacraments, and dad is attending mass too but also not shying away from sharing his non belief and will not force a child to go to mass? Thank you. I know I have an moral obligation to raise children in the church and trying to figure out if this is at all doable before getting the marriage convalidated.",a2omxw,self.Catholicism,,True

Discussion on why many Protestants don’t think we’re Christian.,Catholicism,"Hey everyone, I came back to the Church about a year ago, after about 2 years of being non-denominational Protestant. Now that I’m back to the Catholic Church im quite honestly shunned by all those old friends. My beliefs haven’t changed. I still believe and Love in the Lord. Yet to these people I’m un-Christian. For example: I was just commenting on facebook with people, and they were claiming the Apostles Creed wasn’t legit becuase it’s “not in the bible” I laid out what I’d say is a pretty concise answer, and their rebuttal is “well aren’t you Catholic now” etc etc. That’s how it always goes. I get on reddit that doesn’t seem to be the case with our Protestant brothers and sisters. But reddit leans extremely liberal. In the real world where most Christians are extremely right leaning, we’re literally the devil to them. It’s frightening to me. What if I am wrong and not properly believing in Jesus? I know the apologetics. But I have anxiety so these things can freak me out. There had to be a reason so many Christians broke away from the Church in the reformation, no? Do you think there’s any hope for Christian Unity in our lifetimes? ",a3s2cj,self.Catholicism,,True
A Baptist from the American South wandered up to the Tiber one day....,Catholicism,"TL;DR out the gate (No worries, I have a touch of adhd as well): 40 year old history buff who was a life-long Baptist is standing on the banks of the Tiber and wondering if he should cross. Information on the possible destination needed. Longer version for those of us who have taken their meds: As stated, I have been in Baptist churches for as long as I can remember. Never has a single toe of mine been laid in a Catholic church. To frame this a bit better, I live in the American South. I have learned probably every argument one can think of against the Church. Even early on, some of the arguments were hard to buy ( why wouldn’t I call Mary the Mother of God? She did give birth to Jesus who is God). Others, I swallowed whole hog…until recently when I started to get a better understanding of the faults in those anti-Catholic (and anti-Orthodox) arguments while studying Orthodoxy recently. So, here I am, having wandered far from the trail I was on with the Baptist church, buying into Transubstantiation, accepting that Tradition is needed, and having a better understanding of prayers to saints (still not 100% sure how that one works). I have recently subscribed to the Coming Home newsletter, browse through Stitcher for podcasts, and Audible for audiobooks. Does anyone out there have any recommendations for the aforementioned resources, preferably something with a bit of an apologetics/ Theology 101 slant? I am not quite ready to rev up the 69 Dodge Charger and jump the Tiber, but I cannot help but feel that I need to learn more about the Holy Roman Church as my current situation with the standard Baptist church is leaving me rather empty. *Edit* Wow.

[Free Friday] Lament for the decline of Atheism,Catholicism,"Much ink has been spilled in the modern era over the decline of religion, citing any number of statistics or anecdotes. But, I would argue, not enough has been said about the decline of atheism. Once, the atheist was a force to be contended with. Minds such as Hume, Leibniz, Diderot, and Nietzsche sought to undermine belief in God through philosophic reasoning attacking the ontology of God, arguing that miracles could not be reasonably believed in or that the divine could be shown not to exist through syllogism. While they all had their flaws they were opponents worthy of the name. New atheism though has been reduced to chanting the same tired lines accusing God of being mean and pointing out that Christians sin. While some interesting interlocutors remain far too many have fallen into the cult of Dawkins. Truly a sad fate Edit: I said Leibniz, I meant Spinoza ",a8f104,self.Catholicism,,True
Why should I come back?,Catholicism,"Hello, I'm a lapsed Catholic in my twenties. I stopped going to Mass regularly when I was about 11 and stopped believing entirely when I was about 15. These days I consider myself an agnostic with deist leanings. I don't need to be convinced of the existence of God, I can accept the idea of 'the God of the philosophers', I just need to figure out whether or not Christianity and Catholicism in particular are true. I've been feeling an incredibly strong pull back to the Church over the past year or so, but I'm not willing to discount psychological reasons for it, like nostalgia for my upbringing, my respect for most of the Church's social teachings/views, wanting to 'belong' to something since I'm pretty socially isolated, etc. etc. The main problem is that I find it nearly impossible to have 'faith', which is obviously a key aspect of any religious belief. I really want to know, with 100% certainty or as close as one can get to that, that reverting to Catholicism is the right thing to do. I have been trying to pray and have been feeling many of the things that people describe when they talk about praying- a presence, a peaceful feeling, like someone is actually listening- but again, there is no way for me to know for sure that it isn't entirely psychological. I really want God to just show himself to me, directly, in some way. I'm already familiar with the 'that would violate your free will' argument, I get it, but to be honest, praying and getting no direct response, or at least one that can't be explained away by psychological or other factors, is immensely frustrating, and it stresses me out. I feel left behind, and that a fear of hell would be the only thing that could push me over the edge into belief- Pascal's Wager, basically- but then I feel resentment that such a threat is being held over my head, and I begin to question other people's faith (i.e. whether or not their strong belief would be the same without a fear of hell), and then I question it all, and I'm back to square one. Basically, what are the best reasons for me to come back? How can I be as certain as possible that Catholicism is true, relying on as little faith as possible? I get the idea of the 'leap of faith', and I'm willing to take one, but not to the extent that I would have to totally shut off the rational part of my brain. I'd particularly like to hear from any reverts here who could share their experiences or advice, but any advice at all is of course welcome. Thanks.",a4vt5l,self.Catholicism,,True

I suppose they go there because it 'feels' more sacred than the church they wreckovated in the 70's. The Buddhist monks demanded silence and respect of their sanctuary and taught them traditional meditation techniques, the very qualities they would reject in their own parish as rigid. This is, at least one reason, we are losing. The people in charge are straight up driving teens, literally and figuratively, away from the faith. With the pastors apparent approval.

Starting to lose my faith...,Catholicism,"...in Evolution. Idk, Fam. I'm a trained biologist. This theory has informed my worldview since the first life sciences textbook I picked up in public elementary school. Most of our current models only make sense in an evolutionary context. But the more I think about how ridiculous it would be that Adam and Eve would have to be conceived by essentially sub-rational humans, only to have rational souls infused in them, and then somehow they're torn from their tribe(s) and plopped in a garden separate from all these very-intelligent-and-basically-modern-humans-but-without-an-immortal-soul-and-reason...? Aren't we kind of stretching the bounds of allegory here? And then there's the whole issue that Tradition teaches us that death entered the world with the Fall, yet evolution requires death as a mechanism? Look the evidence is there, I get it. All fossil records point to many epochs before man entered the world. But it's just getting kind of silly to keep turning my mind into a pretzel over shoehorning doctrine into this theory. It seems much more sensible to set the natural science data points on one side, Genesis on the other, acknowledge they don't jive, shrug, and continue following the Faith. Maybe in time we'll come to understand that there's really no dissonance here, but until then, it doesn't make a ton of sense to hold to an evolutionary perspective from a metaphysical standpoint. We can use it as a useful heuristic for scientic research with the understanding that we don't really understand how it all fits together without trying to force Church doctrine to fit the mold.

My thoughts on the aging Catholic community.,Catholicism,"I'm a devout young adult (21) Catholic. I have certainly noticed that while attending mass there is almost no people who are near my age (18-25 is what I would consider close) which is a huge disappointment for me and I hope that this will change soon. This is largely disappointing considering that its very hard to meet people my age that are devout Catholics (especially for dating purposes), it is also to difficult to relate to other people within my age group due to our religious differences. Despite all this, this is because the Catholic community is largely dominated by seniors in most American parishes I have entered (even within my own Universities Newman hall parish). Even though I haven't really talked to the senior community within the Church I can't help but admire them. Sure it is very hard to relate to seniors or even engage in a conversation with them, but what they represent to me is that they have been faithful their whole life (presumably) and it just makes me so happy. Despite seeing the drastic changes that Vatican II has caused or going through the unfortunate church scandals, or even see some of their own children lose interest within the faith they decided to stay faithful to Christ. So while it may be difficult for me to talk to any seniors I encounter in Church I just wanted to let them know that I admire your dedication, it truly is an inspiration. I hope to be just as faithful when I reach the very same age. God Bless you all, you truly are a beacon of light within the Church :) ",a5ellc,self.Catholicism,,True

Pros/cons of “consent”,Catholicism,"Through another thread, “consent” and it’s rise in culture came up. I am torn about it’s benefit and usefulness. As a way of making it easier to educate and make people aware of power dynamics in relationships, I can see the benefit. Yet I think it compromises too much. It seems to assume a culture of promiscuity and objectification is the norm to be safeguarded against by means of ubermensch mentality: I must be the captain of my fate in all things - otherwise I am weak. This only puts more pressure on the woman, and the man is left to decide whether consent has been given or not. Ironic. The emphasis on autonomy and “freedom” seems problematic and divorces sex from it’s very purpose. So rather than focus on teaching men the importance of responsibility and commitment to relationship - that sex ought to include marriage - consent could limit the responsibility to one moment. It more or less applies social contract theory in one of the most intimate places of life. This is a is a system essentially based on distrust. Thoughts? Edit: This thread has been incredibly insightful and I probably don’t express it well enough but I’m glad people responded. I do wonder what I’m missing here - is the topic of sexual abuse just too raw and fresh to address “consent” clearly? Does critique of “consent” sound like advocating against moral transformation of our culture? There just seems to be an unease or defense, or aggression against questioning “consent” and I’m wondering why and where it comes from. Peace",aaabrf,self.Catholicism,,True

Feeling like a fraud under the veil,Catholicism,"Throwaway account here. I felt a strong call to veil two years ago and while it felt amazing and humbling at the beginning, for some reason, more and more, I'm feeling like I don't deserve to do it or maybe like I'm doing it for the wrong reasons. I've been thinking a lot about major past sins and while I have already confessed them, I feel marked by them, like I am damaged goods and will always be soiled. Also, I am going through a huge upheaval in my family and carry a lot of anger which sometimes leaks out in the form of raising my voice to my kids, something I feel awful for doing afterwards (has become a staple during confession). Because of all of this, I am starting to feel like every time I put the veil on during Mass, it's like I'm covering a pile of garbage with something lovely. I used to feel lighter, maybe even holier when the veil went on, but now I just feel like who am I kidding? Has anyone gone through this? Should I stick with the practice? Thank you for taking the time to read this. And please pray for me and my family! &#x200B; Edit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to answer my question. I will continue veiling and try to find a good spiritual director and therapist to help with the journey. God bless you guys!",a8d76g,self.Catholicism,,True
So I wanted to see what Protestant apologists had to say about the Eucharist in the Early Church,Catholicism," quotes a later passage from St Ignatius' Letter to the Smyrnaeans: 'Yea, far be it from me to make any mention of them, until they repent and return to a true belief in Christ's passion, which is our resurrection.' It then adds, *'Are we to conclude that Ignatius believed that Jesus' passion (or faith in His passion) is transubstantiated into our resurrection under the appearance of remaining Jesus' passion (or faith in His passion)? Ignatius often wrote in a manner similar to what we see in the two passages* \[the other being the one on the Eucharist\] *quoted above. That should be a signal to the careful interpreter to proceed with caution.'* So is St Ignatius speaking figuratively, or does he actually say that the Eucharist really is Christ's flesh and blood, but he's wrong because he's influenced by the Platonists? Is *this* the best that Protestant apologists have to offer on the Early Church?",a5d9lu,self.Catholicism,,True

As far as I know, Catholics are supposed to follow the sex rules as well as the doctrine that a husband and wife's bodies belong to one another. Well, what happens if one person wants to have sex and other doesn't? What happens if the husband wants to engage in sex in a way that the wife is not comfortable with? Is she supposed to 'submit'? I'm sure it's more complicated than that, but the submissive aspect is uncomfortable. Maybe I misunderstand it. Thank you in advance. ",a7qssk,self.Catholicism,,True

I was willing to give Cardinal Cupich some benefit of the doubt for not being the *cause* of the 500 sexual predator priests who might be outed in Illinois. But now I read that as Spokane bishop he let Jesuit predators live at Gonzaga University under his watch.,Catholicism," The worst of it isn't just that accused priests got to retire for three straight decades at a nice university, living among college students and ministering to them. The worst is that these guys were the worst of the worst: probably the most notorious priest among them was James Poole, who headed Native American communities in Alaska, raping at least twenty children down to age 6, including one 16 year old girl he impregnated and then **blamed her father, sending him to prison**. He and other Jesuits are part of the ring(s) which targeted Native American communities, molesting the children (who were less likely to go to authorities) and being moved from community to community before retiring in comfort at Gonzaga. \---- Current Spokane bishop Thomas Daly issued a statement distancing himself from the predators, hinting that Cupich had apparently been told but he was only informed recently: >“The Diocese of Spokane shares the concern of those who are angry and saddened to learn that the Oregon Province of Jesuits—now part of the Jesuits West Province—placed Jesuits credibly accused of sexual abuse at the Cardinal Bea House on Gonzaga University’s campus without informing the Gonzaga community...**the Jesuit Provincial, Father Patrick Lee, informed then-Bishop Blase Cupich that seven priests with safety plans in place were living at Bea House**...Bishop Thomas Daly—who was installed in 2015—was not informed by the Jesuits or Gonzaga University that these men were living at Cardinal Bea House.” &#x200B; The claims against the seven priests were credible enough that that Jesuit order had 'safety plans' requiring them to have supervision and not be alone with students. However, predictably, McCarrick-style, that doesn't seem to have mattered: >at least some credibly accused priests had regular unsupervised access to the university campus and unsupervised visits with students, and were permitted to lead prayer services in other settings, including Native American reservations. There's this great quote from one of the molesters: >“We love being right in the middle of campus,” Obersinner told the school’s student newspaper. “It’s a blessing to see the active energy and happiness of youth every day.” *Lord have mercy on us. Christ graciously hear us.*",a84uwa,self.Catholicism,,True
"TIL about the Truce of God, a Catholic practice that tied warfare to the liturgical calendar and made it almost impossible to wage war in Europe. In large part thanks to the Truce, human and industrial capital in Europe flourished for the three centuries of the 'High Middle Ages'.",Catholicism,"After the collapse of the Carolingian Empire in France during the 900s, constant warfare between French nobles led a group of French bishops at the Council of Charroux in 989 to declare a 'Peace of God' and excommunicate anyone in Western France who attacked women, children, farmers, merchants, clergy, and churches, as well as anyone who participated in offensive warfare from sundown on Saturday (or a vigil of a major feast day) until sunrise on Monday (or the day after the feast). The idea of temporary ends to hostility to allow the celebration of holy days of obligation ('Truces of God') spread throughout France, Italy, and Germany and additional Truces were established in other regional councils of the 1000s, adding more and more times when warfare could not be waged. By the time of the Third Lateran Council in 1179, all Christendom was bound under pain of excommunication not to participate in offensive warfare: * From sundown Wednesday to sunrise Monday (in honor of the Lord's Ascension on Thursday, Passion on Friday and Saturday, and Resurrection on Sunday), * From the First Sunday of Advent to the end of the Octave of Epiphany (January 13), and * From the Septuagesima (9 weeks before Easter) to the end of the Octave of Easter. At a maximum, only 2.5 days were available a week, and only 35 weeks a year for warfare, even before taking into account particular feast days in Ordinary Time that might fall on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. This was also only the minimal rule for the entire Church; many of the Western bishops had added another three weeks to cover the period of Rogation, the Ascension, and the Octave of Pentecost. As a result, only about 80 days a year were available--in small chunks and with no rain check if the weather was unsuitable--for battle. All men of military age were required to swear an oath every three years to respect the Truce, and violations were swiftly and consistently handled by the bishops, who had a policy of enforcing one another's excommunications even if a noble who violated the Truce moved to a new territory. Because of the Truce, warfare and siege became completely economically infeasible, as one would have to pay and feed an army full time that would fight less than 25% of the time. At least one historian has claimed we owe everything that was good about the High Middle Ages--the cathedrals, scholasticism, advances in farming, the establishment of infrastructure--to the sheer complexity of the liturgical calendar and the Church's insistence that honoring God must come before any earthly pursuit of power or revenge. Until monarchs consolidated power and began to directly challenge the Popes in the 1300s and wage wars like the Hundred Years' War, Europe had an astonishing period of peace and growth due to the lack of senseless loss of human life on the battlefield or of diverting resources to rebuilding areas destroyed by warfare.",a30zqp,self.Catholicism,,True

"Went to Mass at a different parish today, left feeling like I'd attended a different religion's service.",Catholicism,"My wife and I are both recent converts (Tiber Swim Teams 2017/18), and so far we've been blessed with a parish which celebrates a nice, reverent N.O. Mass. Our parish building itself is also quite old (built in the 1800's), so we have nice, traditional architecture. Tabernacle front and center, and beautiful stain glass windows depicting the mysteries of the rosary. It's not necessarily ideal (I'd prefer ad orientem), but overall I can't complain - and it's far from any of the 'spirit of VII' nightmares I've read about on here. Even when we've gone to Mass while on vacation, it's always been as good as, if not better than, at our home parish. Today was different. Due to work being crazy and other unfortunate schedule conflicts, my wife and I had to go to a new parish today so we could fulfill our Sunday obligation. It was the first time I've really gotten a taste of the 'spirit of VII' liturgies I've heard about here. There was constant chattering before Mass, no Tabernacle in sight, and the only windows I saw were just mosaics of random geometric shapes; but, there were tambourines, and clapping - as well as at least a dozen EMHCs, and almost exclusively female altar servers. Rather than the choir loft we're used to, the choir was situated right up front and sang in a sort of 'try hard' way (if that makes sense) which appeared to be geared more towards entertainment than worship. You get the picture. It was rather upsetting for me, and when we left my wife commented that she felt like we hadn't even gone to Mass. I'm sorry, but I just needed to vent. Maybe I'm just turning into a stick in the mud, but honestly I am pretty shaken. The thing is that it's not even like we're your stereotypical radtrads - I have nothing against the TLM, but I've only ever been to one, and my wife never has. We don't hate the New Mass, we just want reverently celebrated Liturgy. Ultimately, I was struck by a young man about my age in the pew in front of us confiding in the person next to him, saying that he almost never goes to Mass. Halfway through, I realized that I couldn't blame him. I barely wanted to be there myself, and I am a practicing Catholic.

PSA: You can use NFP and still go against Church teaching,Catholicism,"My wife and I taught marriage prep, couples enrichment, and NFP for years for the diocese. One of the things I would get into discussion with the couples we taught, especially the young, was that NFP can still go against Church teaching. In its simplest form, NFP is nothing more than using the body's natural mechanism to prevent pregnancy, and while it does keep a slight possibility of procreation open, the desire and intent of the participants plays a huge role in whether or not it violates the natural order of sex. So, if one is using NFP as a form of natural contraception with the intent to prevent pregnancy without grave cause, it's morally no different than using artificial contraception. Discuss.

Because I’m not worthy to enter the sanctuary. So I stood in the vestibule. But that was basically like not participating because the priest’s microphone was turned off, so I couldn’t hear his homily. All I could seem to notice were all the handsome men who are my age (and probably all straight), while my ugly ass ogled at them. Because when I was in Church, all I could do was stare, be superficial, and be distracted. I don’t feel welcome in Church. I can’t do this anymore. I’m a bad man, let alone a Catholic.

Is it somehow against the Catholic notion of marriage for an engaged couple to request no children at a wedding?,Catholicism,"This is based on a viral post on another sub where a bride posted about wanting an adult-only wedding.

However, I have seen a few post like this one arguing that it is against the Catholic idea of marriage for kids to be excluded from the wedding.  While excluding children from the ceremony itself might be poor form (and I don't think even possible), I always thought that it was a good idea to have receptions be adult only. In fact, most receptions I've been to have been for only adults. Receptions tend to go way past bedtimes and can get loud. Young children tend to get bored and cranky at them. However, do you disagree on this one? Is an adult only wedding reception against the Catholic notion of marriage and family or 'modernist' as the Tweet I posted above mentions?

The Illinois news today, like every one of these, just infuriates me. It makes no sense. I was never abused myself and know of nothing like that ever happening in what was once my own church. Why, in your opinion, does the church as a body still shield so many of these criminals instead of cutting them loose?

The Church, at the Papal level and lower, basically throwing themselves on the mercy of all of us and saying, 'Yes, we REALLY screwed up, and severely, and children were hurt. Effective now it's highest church law that anyone who did this or worked to cover it up is out. No retirement, no job, no career, defrocked, thrown out, banned from the grounds. OUT.' 2. Anyone convicted or credibly accused or who had a settlement is cut loose per above. Go get a job and start a new life as a non-priest. You're out forever; your relationship with the Church is now only between you and God. 3. Turn over EVERYTHING, to date, to law enforcement. 4. Anyone found to have covered up or moved known abusers around is similarly out. Zero tolerance, and law going forward. 5. Permanent global zero tolerance/mandatory reporting. 6.

Little SSA Victory,Catholicism,"Hello Everyone, long time lurker here. I started my official journey to convert this year. It's been 4 months since I acted on my SSA attraction. This weekend was particularly difficult. I had the house to myself, the weather was cold and lonely, I had made all the plans to entertain someone after a long back and forth thought battle with myself. Every thing was arranged, and I was fully aware of the sin. There were still few hours left so I started to work out. As I am sweating it out and more 'awake' something just changed. I felt loved and complete. I closed my eyes and focused on Jesus, mary, holy spirit and father's love in my life. Well after my workout I cancelled the plans. There was a sense of relief. Throughout today I kept myself busy and now the weekend it over and I am packing my lunch for tomorrow. Had I not taken the step to start my conversion journey, It would have been same old cycle.

Why doesn't God reveal himself empirically? Why doesn't God reveal himself directly to everyone on the planet? Wouldn't a God who truly wanted everyone to be saved to everything in his power to try and convince everyone?,Catholicism,"Just what the title says! I've been listening to some Catholic Answers recently, and whenever an atheist caller calls in and says that they don't believe in God because of the lack of empirical evidence, the apologists at Catholic Answers always explain that because God is not a physical, material being, there would be no empirical revelation of his existence. This doesn't make any sense to me however, because according to the Bible, God/Jesus interacted physically with the earth many times, from causing the sun to stop in the sky, to turning rivers to blood, to parting the red sea, to multiplying loaves and fishes, to walking on water, etc. We know that God is apparently capably of interacting with the natural world in ways that demonstrate his supernatural powers, so why doesn't he do this? Is God incapable of providing empirical evidence, or does he just not want to? On that matter, why doesn't Jesus just appear to everyone around the world and preach the gospel to them, tell them how much he loves them and ask them to repent and follow him? He could even appear physically, as an actual physical form that we could touch and see, just like Thomas did. Why doesn't God do this? It's true that if he appeared to everyone all over the world, people would come up with alternate explanations to try and deny his existence, but I think that myself and the vast majority of humanity would simply accept what they witnessed and touched and submit to God's will. It's certainly a better strategy then what God is doing right now, where only about 1/7 of the world is even Catholic. Why does God hide his existence from everyone? It seems like by not giving people full knowledge of his existence he is allowing them to be easily mislead by other religions or those who preach no religion at all. ",a5ydyn,self.Catholicism,,True
My priest strongly dislikes me and my family of 4 and it's making me dread going to Mass.,Catholicism,"Obligatory 'I'm on mobile' disclaimer. :) I need advice. We moved to a mission diocese in rural MO a couple years ago and started attending a small parish. Our priest was never all that friendly to start with, but as time has gone on I can tell he has taken an active dislike to me and my family. I started volunteering to cantor since there weren't enough singers to cover both masses. I had to sing a Capella and whenever I made a mistake he would shake his head and comment into his mic things like, 'no no no' or 'she's off key.' Though this really hurt me, I only stopped cantoring when my 2nd child was born after participating for a year. Recently my 2 toddlers have been rowdy at mass and I have actually caught my priest giving us dirty looks from the altar. Last Sunday he raised his voice to my 3 year old and made her cry. The same day he cancelled a project my artist husband was going to donate to the church. I have asked around and tried to observe how he treats other families and have concluded it's just us. We are traditional and try to be faithful Catholics but I hate hate hate going to Mass these days and never go to confession with this priest. Any advice? Prayers are of course welcome. I'm hoping to fix this. In every other parish we have cherished and loved our priests. I really want that back. Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your comments and advice.

I think I will leave the Church,Catholicism,"I have been Catholic all my life, and have been reading this sub for several years. It has been much torment and sacrifice trying to live a Catholic life. I have never been able to fully believe in my heart, and I have never felt or experienced the presence of God in anyway. I have read much on the faith and theology - they share the fact that they serve to confirm belief for someone who already believes. This religion has been the biggest disappointment of my life. Any Catholic I've met in life believes out of habit, and no one has ever truly been able to respond to any of my doubts. These are some of them: * There is no experience of God or the divine. The sacraments don’t do anything. Why make the Eucharist’s divinity undetectable in any way? There are no credible miracles, with most relying on hearsay or simply being medieval legends. No amount of praying for any amount of time has any discernable effect. Similar results can be seen when praying to any other deity of any other religion, or a toaster. * If God exists, why doesn’t he reveal himself? The thought that doing so violates will is preposterous – in that case the disciples had no free will in following Jesus, and neither is there free will in heaven given the Beatific vision. The history of Christianity’s dispersal, extra ecclesiam nulla sallus, and God’s apparent will for our salvation do not work well together. * Free will and omniscience. Either God is outside time or in each moment of time and experiencing it as we do the present – pick one. Scripture places God as acting within time frequently. I don’t see how this solves the issue of free will anyway. Regardless of God’s perception, a necessary future already exists and cannot be changed. Mary is held to have freely chosen to accept the bearing of Christ – this free will depends on Christ’s sacrifice acting retroactively. This make’s Mary’s choice necessary, and she could not freely choose. Could Judas have chosen differently? Could Peter? No. * Why does original sin have to inflict concupiscence on all of humanity when dogmatically it was the choice of two initial people? This is a huge threat to salvation. Given an omnipotent God, there is no reason it had to be the case. The catechism cops out and calls it a mystery, when apparently Catholicism is the whole and universal Truth™ * Why do the means justify the ends for God and not for us? If morality is objective and stemming from an unchanging God that is goodness itself, why is genocide permissible in the old testament and not later? You cannot call genocide, capital punishment for trivial things ceremonial law. You cannot make morality ‘dependent’ on context without accepting relativism. Saying the law was ‘fulfilled’ rather than ‘changed’ is semantics. * The Church approved of slavery. * Scholastic arguments can prove an uncaused cause at best, but nothing close to the Catholic God. I don’t believe substance, essence, or universals exist beyond language. Much of Catholic doctrine has no basis without the assumption that Scholastic metaphysics are correct. * If you had foreknowledge that your actions would result in the proliferation of vast evil and suffering, would you hold some responsibility in that evil? God is in part responsible for all evil. * Why let Satan run free seeking the ruin of souls you apparently wish to be saved? * Why couldn’t we all be immaculately conceived? Despite baptism and Christ’s sacrifice, humans are just as inclined to sin as before, and concupiscence still exists. Nothing changed in humans to make them closer to their pre-Fall state. I am not looking for an escape from the Church so I may sin. I am not 'hardening my heart' when I pray daily out of desperation. I have a crisis daily trying to reconcile my Catholic life with my actual beliefs. ",aai10n,self.Catholicism,,True
"Had my first ever bad confession experience, what now?",Catholicism,"Throwaway for confessionary reasons, duh. So my parish had it's Advent penance service last night, multiple priest, group examination of conscience, typical drill. I end up third in line to the confessional with a priest I don't know. First two were ladies in their 50s or 60s, and they are out of there in a matter of minutes. The lady behind me asks if I'm going to be quick. I was told her absolutely, this wasn't a therapy session, sins and number only. Now, I've been confessing for thirty years a couple times a year. If I have scruples, it's exceptionally low grade. I've had confessions where I feel great, like I'm born again. I've had confessions where it felt like I put down a burden. This was nothing like that. I enter the booth in silence, and once I realize he isn't going to say anything I begin bless me father...it's been 8mo since my last confession. From there I'm going through my list, nothing too unusual, props to Fr. for a good examination of conscience. What got a reaction was when I mentioned how I've played video games on my phone during mass. Apparently I hit a nerve, because I immediately asked how old I was in one of those way to angry for the situation tones. I told him my age (40s) and he told me, 'You're pathetic!' Loud enough for me to look behind me when I realized the door was shut. I got to thinking, 'well I suppose from 10,000ft *all* sin is pathetic...' At that point he asked in one of those tones if I knew what happens at the mass. 'Absolutely.' I said, leaving unspoken that if I didn't I wouldn't be confessing a couple hands of cards while Father is asking the young children what they discussed during the liturgy of the word. He then asked in a tone I read as sarcasm if I had *anything else* to confess. I did. Got my penance. I'm absolved so life is good. No real harm or foul, I suppose. Now I've been called *a lot* of things in my life but never pathetic. Here it is a day later and I'm still bothered by it. I'm not angry anymore, but more confused and hurt. Normally I'd be in here trying to come up for excuses for him, but he couldn't have been that tired, he hadn't been hearing confessions ten minutes, and I wasn't rattling off bad thoughts or other people's sins. I was pointedly not going into great detail to minimize my culpability. I don't know if this priest has no filter or if I hit a nerve because I've never been to his mass,. I'm not sure what I did to deserve that. I'm actively trying to do right. I come to you guys. Your advice in the aggregate is solid and Orthodox. I'm still bothered by this, what ought I take from this situation. P.S. don't say lay off the phone, I know that, that's why I confessed. ;-)",a7g8tk,self.Catholicism,,True

CMV: Forced celibacy is harmful to clergy,Catholicism,"I could be wrong on a lot of this, i'm still quite new to Catholicism. I very much like the Orthodox version of how they do things. Priests can get married but cant be promoted higher and it seems they have a much lower rate of abuse. Additionally it could make the priesthood a lot more attractive to young men. Celibacy for clergy was not always a requirement in Catholicism (i think?) so why keep it? To me it seems that denying one of lifes most basic urges has to have had very bad repercussions on many men who have gone on to abuse others due to a life of repression. Anglican priests (that are married) that convert to become Catholic priests are allowed to keep their spouse, so it seems to me the issue is a political one rather than theological.

Taylor Marshall’s disingenuousness regarding Communion in the Hand,Catholicism,"I’m under no illusions that this post will be well-received, but I feel an obligation to address the falsehoods propagated in  immediately before the parts which refute him: >And at Alexandria and in Egypt, each one of the laity, for the most part, keeps the communion, at his own house, and participates in it when he likes...And even in the church, when the priest gives the portion, the recipient takes it with complete power over it, and so lifts it to his lips with his own hand. Basil not only witnesses to the practice in church, but also encourages his reader to take Communion home with him for daily reception, and multiple early witnesses exist to this practice, particularly Tertullian. The distinction Basil draws isn’t between receiving in the hand (which is what he says happens in his own diocese) and receiving on the tongue, but rather receiving multiple portions from the priest for daily communion (which is encouraged) vs. taking from another’s or a common stock (which is permissible depending on circumstance.) **St. Cyril** Dr. Marshall: *”We currently have 18 undoubted lectures from Saint Cyril given to his catechumens in preparation for Holy Baptism at Easter. Now then, there are an additional five mystagogical lectures allegedly given by Cyril...Now the five follow-up lectures are highly debated and may not be authentic.\** Marshall is overstating the academic debate. There are three commonly accepted possibilities for these lectures: Either they were written by Cyril around 350 with the others, by Cyril between 370-380, or by his successor John II ca. 400. In any case, no one doubts that they reflect a common tradition and the practice of the Church of Jerusalem at that time. Marshall: *”Even if this passage is authentic (and I don’t think that it is), then Communion in the Hand should also include touching both the Holy Body and the Holy Blood to our eyes. Yet who wants to argue for this custom?! I think that every Catholic would find this abhorrent. It is an aberration from holy tradition.”* This is silly. The Patristic record *is* the tradition, not what modern Catholics would subjectively classify as abhorrent. Secondly, no one is arguing that the Church should base its practice on Cyril’s lecture, but rather refuting the claim that the Church’s consistent, historic, unbroken practice was to commune on the tongue. &#x200B; Edit: Formatting.

Girlfriend and I went to confession on Christmas Eve and copped an absolute roasting,Catholicism,"I'd love your thoughts on this. We go to Mass about once a month and confession maybe once a year. We have lived together for about 7 months. We both wanted to end the year well and go to confession and Midnight Mass, and the parish that had both was very conservative e.g. they have a statue of Josemaría Escrivá in the foyer and lots of women in the church wear mantles. Totally different from our usual liberal parish. Confession continued to run through Mass right up until the eucharistic prayer and we were both pretty late in the queue. We had basically given up and promised to go next week but the priest gave a homily saying how utterly vital confession was and to take communion in a state of mortal sin was as bad as taking the host and crushing it underfoot, as well as doing serious damage to your soul. Whelp okay, I took the chance to confess and my gf followed me afterwards. Inside the priest gave me a caring and respectful but extremely stern dressing down on living my life in sin and playing Russian Roulette with my soul. My girlfriend got even more of a serve than me: 'gahhh you can't do that!' was the response through the curtain when she told him we were living together. Suddenly we both have had a serious jolt to how we are living our lives. Spoke to Mum about it at Christmas and she was extremely surprised - her parish, the one I attended as a child, is very liberal, no emphasis on confession, not much talk of sin, and she summarised the Christmas homily as all about welcoming the stranger, loving others, caring for the marginalised etc. Social justice stuff really. So I've just had my first real, tangible confrontation with the vast differences in the church - the liberal side I grew up with and the conservative side that bludgeoned me on Christmas Eve. It has thrown a massive wrench into our relationship. We are supposed to be in a state of grace but we spent most of Christmas arguing and agonising over what the hell we are to do now and it has caused such bitterness and confusion that we're barely talking today. I think we're both drawn to making the leap to '100% Catholic' for 2019 (gf has basically decided on it) but I was quite happy with my liberal Catholicism and now I don't know who I am. My girlfriend openly fears this could be the wedge that drives us apart, and is questioning the whole relationship. &#x200B; EDIT: Thanks so much for all your responses.

Is your parish plagued with the scourge of 'church ladies'?,Catholicism,"**NB**: In today's social justice warrior world it can be difficult to ask a serious but difficult question in some settings without immediately being branded a (choose one or more depending on the question/setting): bigot, hater, homophobe, incel, misogynist, Nazi, racist, sexist, etc. Please don't let this thread degenerate into something distasteful. I have serious questions about something that has taken a real toll on my parish over the years and I seek to better understand it. Thanks. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ For the last 50 or so years my parish has been plagued by the scourge of 'church ladies.' More specifically women who have staked claims to small pieces of turf (typically something to do with the liturgy or catechetics) as 'coordinators.' **Highly territorial**, they *savagely* protect their turf with everything they have -- typically doing a poor job while being rude to others in the process. *To be fair there are male versions of 'church ladies', but they are exceedingly rare in my experience. There are also plenty of women deeply involved in their parishes (the music director at my parish is a good example) who are not 'church ladies.' I chose this label because one of the worst of the worst 'church ladies' in my parish actually has* ' ) During that three year period, a lot of garbage was pumped into the sisters' brains which they handed down to their students. In some cases here locally, the former sisters who had left their order remained as teachers, allowing them additional time to pollute their student's brains and the brains of many others in the parish before the local HS closed in 1970. This was also a period of the “turn on, tune in, drop out' generation. There was a great change in our pastor (long after he retired he told me he loved to 'buck the system' by assigning altar girls,long before they were allowed by the Church.) A number of the parochial vicars that cycled through my parish at that time were also highly problematic and clearly products of their septic generation. It was then that 'church ladies' began to gain their foothold. Initially they replaced the sisters as catechists and sacristans -- they were huge drivers of 'out with the Baltimore Catechism and in with the making of felt banners.' One actually still tries to place felt banners in the church! Then a number of positions were created for them -- from 'liturgy coordinators' to 'environment coordinator' to the coordinator in charge of altar servers, EMsHC, readers, etc. The 'priest shortage' was often used as an excuse to justify their existence. Without a doubt they initially made the priests' jobs easier, even thought they themselves didn't do good jobs. After awhile the bloated and warring tribal bureaucracy they created took a greater toll on clergy than if the priests simply did the work themselves. Pastors came and went, but the 'church ladies' survived, solidifying their positions. Their arrogance, incompetence, penis envy and just plain meanness flourished. Some of them earned 'certificates' from an on-line diploma mills which made them all the more difficult and unfortunately no more competent. They facilitated the downward turn of the liturgy, the loss of fellowship opportunities, and anything else they couldn't control. Their existence has taken a horrid toll on our parish. **Now my questions**. What drives these 'church ladies' and why are they allowed to continue? One erudite priestly friend suggested that many pastors felt a responsibility to promote women for such positions because they were not eligible for ordination (he did not share this opinion), and that the positions attracted some truly rotten apples. Other people I have talked to suggested the 'church ladies' simply had time on their hands and they were in desperate search of a setting where they could practice some semblance of power and control. Is there more to it? Is there something specifically ingrained in women -- biological or psychological, that make some of them act as 'church ladies' do? While the aforementioned behavior is not wholly unique to 'church ladies' (or even females in general), I have never experienced this level anywhere else. As to why they are allowed to continue, I think I have a better handle on that. They are so entrenched at my parish (some are married to deacons for instance) that it would really take some courage and a lot of hard work for a pastor to truly reform my parish. I suspect this is true elsewhere. I also think in some cases that pastors know what's going on and they actually like what the 'church ladies' do. In other words, they're lazy. Others have suggested their existence is more demonic in nature? I really don't know, but I wouldn't discount this -- particularly after the 'church ladies' decorated our parish conference room with a poster of the goddess Sophia a number of years ago when we were between pastors. **I really wonder how many souls have been driven away from the Church by the existence of 'church ladies', and how many have never actually entered the Church because of same?** Any insights would be appreciated.

"I'm a faithful Catholic with same sex attraction who was considering the priesthood. Given the Pope's recent words, should I reconsider this path?",Catholicism,"Ok throwaway account here because this is personal. I am a faithful Catholic and have been my whole life. I'm 20 now and have very strong same sex attraction. Because of that, marriage is not an option for me (it would be unfair to any woman I would marry). That got me starting discerning if priesthood is God's path for me. I've been seeking God and praying about this calling and talking to the priests at my Catholic university since I came to college. Although I haven't made my decision official, for about a year and a half I have indeed felt a strong calling towards the priesthood. However, given the recent scandals again and Pope Francis' words saying that people like me shouldn't be priests. I want to be obedient to the Holy Father and so it seems like the priesthood is actually off-limits to me. &#x200B; I'm very lost now.",a2jf4x,self.Catholicism,,True
I feel so embarrassed that I couldn't defend my faith.,Catholicism,"This morning I was getting a ride to work from my friend, who happens to be staunchly atheist. On the way, we passed 3 Catholic churches, and I made the sign of the cross as we passed each one. My friend asked, 'Why do you keep doing that?' and I replied, 'None of your business. You're just gonna tell me it's stupid, so why do you care?' He said, 'I'm genuinely trying to understand.' So I explained that it's just something that we do as a sign of respect. He inquired, 'A sign of respect for what, exactly?' So I explained how we, as Catholics, show respect for the Eucharist when it is present in a church as we pass by making the sign of the cross because we believe that Christ is truly present. His response? 'But why would you show respect to something that doesn't respect you?' When I asked him to elaborate, he said that God couldn't possibly have respect for me because if he did, 'then why do [I] have anxiety and depression? Wouldn't God save [me] from that kind of suffering?' I had no answer other than, 'God gives us free will and my own actions have caused me to suffer.' After a bit of back and forth, we changed the subject. I felt embarrassed and ashamed that I couldn't defend myself or our faith any better. I need to do some more reading, it seems. While I'm not upset with my friend, the interaction has left me feeling very hurt and disappointed in myself. Please pray for me. **Update: I want to thank you all for your insight, your constructive criticism, and your humor-- it made me feel much better about the situation. I went to Mass tonight and found myself in tears during the Homily and after having received the Holy Eucharist. I decided to offer up the emotional hurt I was feeling to Our Lord and to our Blessed Mother. I also decided that I would be careful about engaging in conversation with people who are dedicated to misunderstanding us and the way we think about our faith. May God bless you all :)**",a3caxp,self.Catholicism,,True

My partner broke up with me because of my faith,Catholicism,"Title sums it up, pretty much. He's raised Catholic but fell away from the church as a teenager. When we started dating, he started attending church with me, and came back to his faith. I'm in RCIA and joining the church at Easter. We'd been together a while so it was getting serious, and we were planning a trip to Paris, where he knows I've always wanted to get engaged. So this has come massively out of the blue. This morning he said he needed to think on his own; he was meant to be travelling hours to see me at my family's house tomorrow and spend New Years together. This pretty much escalated into 'fundamental irreconcilable differences' and that he's leaving me because I'm more pious than him. Aside from being absolutely stunned, I really don't know how to feel. I found myself telling him it'd be fine, that I'd compromise (which I shouldn't), and saying that the no sex being marriage thing will be fine too, which isn't fair to me or to my relationship with God. I'm basically just here to ask for advice. I'm sure some of you will have experienced this before. I know I'd be happiest with another Catholic, and that I want my future family to be Catholic, but I found myself suddenly throwing it out of the window to stay with him. Aside from any comforting advice (Exodus 14:14 is in my head), what do I do? How can my faith, which is so beautiful and important to me, be the reason someone breaks my heart? (I know there are worse fates, i.e. martyrdom, but it's hard to stay positive). How can I have been too Catholic when I'm not even a full member of the Church yet?!",aacieg,self.Catholicism,,True

The horror of purgatory and what awaits so many unsuspecting souls,Catholicism,"This winter I picked up the worse dose of flu in 41 years of my life, it is a strain of swine flu that is particularly nasty. I always assumed I have had the flu previous years and it’s bounced off me, oh no, no matter what I had previous years it is incomparable to the real thing, whatever hit me this year I stayed hit. This thing ruined me, for the past 7 days I have been bedridden and utterly wiped out unable to do just about anything except produce record levels of mucus and cough in a wretched way, my sides like daggers because of the heaving, nose streaming and sore, no sleep, backache, headache, eyes sore, throat sore it has just been a bloody mess, literally as capillaries burst inside my sinuses. So naturally as a Catholic I thought, ‘Great! I can offer this up for the Holy Souls!’ which is exactly what I did the first few days feeling it was at least doing some good, which I’m sure it was. Now around day 3 I started to joke with the wife about how often people died from the flu as I was getting pretty bad, my temperature was soaring. I started to reflect on suffering. The thing is when I started to seriously reflect on my own suffering, to quantify what was a horrible experience it struck me how very little pain was involved. It was a culmination of a hundred little annoyances and irritations that combined to give a dreadful feeling of being run-down and exhausted. When I tried to focus on pain levels I realised for the most there was no actual pain except when I was heaving trying to cough and wretch or when my headache was full on, or swallowing after waking up. It was all small doses of pain that contributed to give a general impression of it as a whole. Purgatory is separated into many levels of suffering, from the almost exact same torturous pain as hell at the bottom to relatively mild near Heaven at the top. I realised that whatever this dreadful experience I was going through it was very likely to be if not right at the top of purgatory then very close to it. I wasn’t really suffering anything other than mild discomfort everywhere at any one time. Now compare this to real pain like fire. Could I hold my hand over a candle and which would seem worse, the flu or fire? Obviously fire but here is the thing, would I be willing to suffer the fire for a very short period in exchange for a week of misery of the flu? How about 5 seconds? Could I hold my hand in the hottest part of a candle flame for 5 seconds and be completely cured would it be worth it? I realised that despite the benefits of being able to return to work and earn money, to function quite normally albeit with a small burn on me, actually I don’t think I could do it. Now we are talking about a tiny localised flame burning a chosen body part for a fraction of time, a time so short you spend more time yawning. I looked up online about temperature of candles and was surprised they do burn hot for their size, between 800-1400 degrees Celsius. This reminded me of something I heard a demon testify to during an exorcism I was reading about a while ago. The priest had commanded the demon to speak on something concerning the environment he existed in below, it was relating to a burns victim on earth and what the demon said really unnerved me in the manner it was given up. It was questioned on suffering on earth and how it compared to hell, it replied, ‘*There is no comparison, down here your fire on earth is cold compared to our fire*’. Your fire is cold, now that tells me something about the horror of eternal fire and how it affects the soul in the afterlife. We are veiled this life from feeling the effects of our sin, the pain they cause God but we have been assured when we die we will witness the pain of our sins. This reminded me of a scene from a really interesting film called, ‘Sunshine’, the scene I had in mind was  of street urchins in New York circa 1890. What I need is not another picture of a forest or sunset, I need this image hanging on my wall to reflect on each day I wake up because these children are still out there. They are out there tonight somewhere right now, different bodies but what they represent. If they get the flu it's hard to compare how their little bodies will cope with just the rags on their backs.

"Premarital sex is wrong, but we shouldn’t make an idol out of virginity",Catholicism,"I just have some thoughts I wanted to share on this. Got into a debate with someone determined to marry a virgin and it made me think. Sex outside of marriage is wrong, but we are all sinners, and the reason I find an extreme focus on virginity so disturbing is that it is dangerous to make people feel like “damaged goods”. That is not true, nobody is beyond redemption: there is no special word for someone who has never stole or lied, so why should there be a special word for someone who has never had sex? Or at least why should that word carry so much weight?At it’s most extreme, this is the type of attitude that can cause vulnerable women and young girls to get abortions because they can’t bear for anyone to know they have had sex, even if they were pressured into it or raped. The evil of abortion is worse than the sin of premarital sex, but placing such a high value on virginity can cause people to feel they have to hide all evidence of this one sin, and can come at a great cost. I have read testimonies from women who deeply regret their abortions, but felt pressured by this kind of purity culture into covering all trace of their sins. And if they were raped but made to feel “unpure” it is even more tragic as it is not their sin at all! Tl:dr: Making too much of an idol of “virginity” could result in grave consequences. We should focus on living chastely in the present, and recognise that we are all sinners, and sexual sin should be forgotten once confessed, if God has given someone a “clean slate” then so should we. Edit: I seem to have upset a lot of people here, I’m sorry. I was brought up Catholic, but sexuality was never discussed much. The past few months I’ve been growing a lot stronger in my faith and I’ve been trying to understand things for myself, but I’m still learning a lot and have a few misunderstandings. I didn’t mean to undermine the value of virginity, I congratulate everyone waiting for marriage - I am also waiting for marriage, but I don’t believe that makes me any better than my friends who have made mistakes in the past and repented, I think many of them are holier than me. I made this post because a guy on the Catholic Dating subreddit had made a rather misogynistic post about how he wants to marry a virgin. He sounded very entitled and his tone was offensive, comparing non-virgins to used cars. It upset me so I made this in response. Sorry if I have upset anyone, I was only trying to promote non-judgemental attitudes. God bless you all. Also, if you are interested, this is an interesting read: ",aaz8ll,self.Catholicism,,True
