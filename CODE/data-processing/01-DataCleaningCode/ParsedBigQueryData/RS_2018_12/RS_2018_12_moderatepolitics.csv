/r/ModeratePolitics Rule Change,moderatepolitics,"We are removing the rule that all submissions must have a starter comment. This was instituted as a result of spam in the subreddit. It worked surprisingly well considering there was an easy way to skirt it by simply posting a quote of the article. It also, surprisingly, started decent discussion most of the time. However, since we currently do not have a “spam” problem, and we mods have been horribly remiss about enforcing it lately, we will be removing the rule. With that said, we will reinstitute it if we think it will solve future spam problems or quality problems. Edit: As a side note, the rule concerning “The Associative Law of Civil Discussion” was also removed as promised, shortly after the election. This rule stated that any attack on a group of people which one of our subscribers identified with was also an attack on that subscriber. I.e. “Republicans are idiots”. It helped us to maintain a more civil subreddit, but there was some subjectivity to the rule. Therefore we limited the time of its implementation to the election and shortly after. That has passed and so has the rule. Though as above, we may reinstitute it as necessary. Please feel free to leave your thoughts below concerning this or any other facet of the subreddit.

Recent televised Trump-Schumer-Pelosi negotiation thoughts. Progressives who are for strict border enforcement?,moderatepolitics,"I fall left, or Progressive, on most issues except on border enforcement and right to bear arms. I see border enforcement as an issue of overpopulation/congestion, dangerous trekking and environmental degradation rather than an issue of culture or race. I think it also makes the social programs, I'm in favor of, harder to implement because of the increased tax burden and government spending if we have unregulated excessive migration. Watching the recent caravan coverage and the televised negotiation between Trump, Schumer and Pelosi I have to agree on the border enforcement issue and it seemed like Schumer was willing to compromise for it before it got derailed towards the end. I disagree with the current president and the right on almost everything else and I see him as a narcissist, damaging to our country and damaging to multiculturalism. In the negotiation, Trump let his ego get in the way and shot himself in the foot towards the end when he started to berate Schumer on the government shutdown. When we look back in a couple decades we will probably agree the current president was on the right side of the migration debate but his delivery, non-compassion and narcissism hurt his own campaign promise. I am progressive on most other things: medicare-for-all, raising the minimum wage, raising taxes back to pre-Trump levels on the wealthy and a green new deal. Eliminate illegal migration, enforce legal migration and focus on who is already here. Essentially, I feel the solution is not to go all far-left or all far-right on the issues, instead a mixmatch of right and left. Is there a name for this political ideology and what incumbent and future candidates run this way on the issues? If there aren't any, why is this a rare point of view? As far as the negotiation, do you think it was wise of Trump to televise it? Or was it a power play that backfired? He mentioned showing 'transparency', I think it was revealing of our political process in a way most haven't seen before, even if it was partly for show. I think they could've cut it short and it got a little more heated but the first half showed how politicians can work to make bi-partisan solutions.",a5fk9k,self.moderatepolitics,,True

A no-nonsense judge looks at the Flynn prosecution,moderatepolitics,"I have been watching the Flynn episode for awhile now because it is the greatest example of abuses of power, railroading, and corruption and it has not one thing to do with Flynn. It has everything to do with the Obama Administration, the FBI and the DOJ working together to destroy a person. If you think Flynn admitting to anything is proof, then you know nothing of this saga. He was legally being drained financially, and could have kept fighting but risked losing everything just to clear his name. He had already sold his house to pay his legal fees. Now as information has trickled out, the more we see the more it looks like Mueller has committed prosecution misconduct and risks feeling the wrath of the Federal Judge in this case overseeing the Fynn verdict. Not to mention the lies from disgraced agent Srtrozk, McCabe and Comey to railroad him. Flynn would have won if he had his day in court but Mueller had no intention of getting him into court, they don't even have a transcript of the interview to submit as evidence. The goal was to bankrupt him into submission. When Clinton was interviewed she had a team if 9 lawyers, when Flynn was interviewed they told him he didn't need legal representation. So pay attention to what Judge Emmitt Sullivan rules, he could very well throw out the guilty plea of Flynn and blast Mueller.",a6vvoc,self.moderatepolitics,,True

When someone tries to create a new platform to complete, it's nigh impossible to compete with some of these juggernauts. Case in point, look at what happens with Comcast when someone tries to move into their area. The fight with Comcast and Chattanooga's municipal fiber is a prime example at how companies will fight tooth and nail to keep companies out. &#x200B; Now I realize that YT, Patreon etc aren't a massive national ISP like Comcast and might not have as much lobbying power, but when there are only a handful of services out there, how do you go about starting your own service to compete against the larger ones? Is that still feasible or should we regulate these like how civil rights are regulated (ie you can't refuse service to black people etc.) How do you think these issues should be dealt with, if at all or should the course just be stayed to see how this all plays out?",a78fij,self.moderatepolitics,,True
