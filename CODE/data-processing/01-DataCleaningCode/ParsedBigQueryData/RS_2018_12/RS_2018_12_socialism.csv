Lenin on revolutionary situations,socialism,"'To the Marxist it is indisputable that a revolution is impossible without a revolutionary situation; furthermore, it is not every revolutionary situation that leads to revolution. What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: (1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the “upper classes”, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for “the lower classes not to want” to live in the old way; it is also necessary that “the upper classes should be unable” to live in the old way; (2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; (3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in “peace time”, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the “upper classes” themselves into independent historical action. Without these objective changes, which are independent of the will, not only of individual groups and parties but even of individual classes, a revolution, as a general rule, is impossible. The totality of all these objective changes is called a revolutionary situation. Such a situation existed in 1905 in Russia, and in all revolutionary periods in the West; it also existed in Germany in the sixties of the last century, and in Russia in 1859-61 and 1879-80, although no revolution occurred in these instances. Why was that? It was because it is not every revolutionary situation that gives rise to a revolution; revolution arises only out of a situation in which the above-mentioned objective changes are accompanied by a subjective change, namely, the ability of the revolutionary class to take revolutionary mass action strong enough to break (or dislocate) the old government, which never, not even in a period of crisis, “falls”, if it is not toppled over.'

Foot's writing is really engaging, exciting, and you can feel his passion and anger at the state of the time in which he's writing (the book was published in 1980), and at the way that the aristocracy -- who shunned Percy Shelley for his radical writings and agitations, atheism, support of workers movements around England, vicious exposition of the emerging bourgeois class, agitation for women's rights and against the subjugation of marriage -- successfully smothered all of that radicalism in favour of presenting him as a socially-acceptable 'ineffectual angel' who wrote a few pretty lyrics. Typing out this book has been nearly a two month long labour of love, but I feel so strongly about it, and it was difficult enough to find physically, and impossible digitally. It's still startling how relevant Shelley's time and struggle is to the period book was written 40 years ago, and still to ours today. So much of what is spoken about is still at the vanguard of leftist conversation and I think that if any of you are lit minded, the book is a passionate entreaty to these ideas through the historical and poetical context of Shelley's life and writing, and I hope it ends up meaning as much to someone else as it does me. ... I *did* type it out and although I've done a proofreading once-over, I'm sure I've missed typos, so I'd be super grateful if you do read it to please let me know if you see any so I can update the file! Also any suggestions for cross-posting are very, very welcome!",a96ip9,self.socialism,,True

Born in Jaro district in what is now Iloilo city, he traveled to Spain in 1879, where he met Marcelo H. del Pilar and Joze Rizal, and with them became a leader of what is called the propaganda or reform movement in the Philippines. The three of them began a newspaper caled La Solidaridad in 1888 with other Philippine socialists who had been exiled previously in 1872. It ran for seven years, but due to the vagaries of Imperialism shut down in 1895 with seven volumes and 160 issues printed. Its farewell editorial written by del Pilar, he said it better than I ever could.

"Changing the World: How Everyday People Fought the Energy Industry, Big Business, Politicians, City Establishment and Shut Down A Nuclear Power Plant Ushered in an Era of Progressive Power in Sacramento",socialism," In 1979, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant (TMI) had a major disaster, a fuck-up that scared the shit out of people around the world. Anyone who lived in the area of a nuclear power plant, especially one designed built by the people who brought us TMI were understandably frightened. Some of those concerned citizens lived in Sacramento, California, home of Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, which, you guessed it, was made by the people who gave us TMI. Led by a poet grandmother, a physic professor, and others, a group of everyday people started a campaign to shut down Rancho Seco. It was a ten year process that involved knocking on doors, petition drives, protests, mobbing public meetings, benefit concerts, marches, a few elections, and more. There were a lot of hard times and defeats, but these folks succeeded in closing down Rancho Seco through a public vote. The nuke plant's closure also meant electing a progressive majority to SMUD, the public utility that owned Rancho Seco. This prog majority went on to enact policies that helped poor people and the environment. SMUD became a pioneer in energy efficiency and green energy. This was the Green New Deal in action decades ago. And, despite the initial objections by conservatives, all of this strengthened SMUD and Sacramento's economy, and resulted in some of the lowest electricity rates in California, not just then but today. This is a long read but it is worth your time, especially now that every day under Trump seems like chaos and that little is changing. This history shows what people can do if they keep organizing through hard times and against the odds, refusing to be told No or to give up. This is a great story of what everyday people like you can do.  ",a8pu2z,self.socialism,,True

People’s control and Direct Democracy,socialism,"To decide means to decide for oneself. To decide who is to decide is already not quite deciding for oneself. The only total form of democracy is therefore direct democracy. Real domination must not be confused with voting. A vote, even a 'free' vote, may only be – and often only is – a parody of democracy. Real democracy is not the right to vote on secondary issues. It is not the right to appoint rulers who will then decide, without control from below, on all the essential questions. Nor does democracy consist in calling upon people electorally to comment upon incomprehensible questions or upon questions which have no meaning for them. Real domination consists in being able to decide for oneself, on all essential questions, in full knowledge of the relevant facts. In these few words 'in full knowledge of the relevant facts' lies the whole problem of democracy.[5] There is little point in asking people to pronounce themselves if they are not aware of the relevant facts. This has long been stressed by the reactionary or fascist critics of bourgeois 'democracy', and even by the more cynical Stalinists[6] or Fabians.[9*] It is obvious that bourgeois 'democracy' is a farce, if only because literally nobody in contemporary society can express an opinion in full knowledge of the relevant facts, least of all the mass of the people from whom political and economic realities and the real meaning of the questions asked are systematically hidden. But the answer is not to vest power in the hands of an incompetent and uncontrollable bureaucracy. The answer is so to transform social reality that essential data and fundamental problems are understood by all, enabling all to express opinions 'in full knowledge of the relevant facts'.

Introduction to the concept of the Dao.,socialism,"The Dao is a concept that few outside of specialized computer science circles know of. However, it is at its core a way to enforce rights, not laws. The DAO is an acronym for a decentralized autonomous organization. For example, let's say a computer program arranged you to meet a customer, that customer spaid the computer in advance, and the computer paid you after it had verified using gps that you arrived at the location, and dropped the customer off at another location. The computer took zero fees, it gave all the profits of labor back to the worker, and it just broke the uber revenue model. The concept of DAOs cannot exist without a trustworthy computer capable of performing the DAO computations free from the hand of any central authority who may seek to corrupt the free labor model of the DAO for profit, and extract value from the DAO business model. As such, DAO's can only be run on decentralized networks with full consensus. Now that you know about DAOs, lets talk about real world applications of DAO technology. Remember last year when Ethereum went from about $2 to over $1400? The reason it went on such a speculative boom is because the ethereum model allows distributed trusted computation that can be publicly audited and is not able to be corrupted if it is held to account by the people. In other words, there is unparalleled amounts of clarity into the inner financial workings of any computation model hosted on the ethereum network. Of course, we live in a capitalist society, and the DAO model was quickly corrupted into a venture funding and angel investor funding model and it turned into an ICO craze. That wasn't wise. But the core heart of the foundation for a DAO remains. Now, let's expand the concept of a DAO to replace ALL corporations and governments. Once this happens, there are no more elite. There is no more extraction of value. So, let me tell you about the next project to ignite the concept of DAOs. One that is immune to the ICO gambling madness that stole the ethereum dream. The IOTA platform is creating a project called qubic. It allows a group of computers to be **randomly** selected, and to vote on the truth of an outcome of a certain amount of computation. What is great about this model is that unlike the Ethereum model, you cannot use this model to create new tokens which is what was used to speculate and destroy the advent of the DAO in the past. The Iota qubic project is nearing completion, and once it finishes, the first DAOs will be launched to service smart contracts between companies. However, the platform will also allow smart contracts to be serviced amongst customers. You should know this because of two things. First, when the DAOs launch, there will be new companies launching. You will not be able to apply for a job with them. You will simply download an app, and be able to be paid a fair market wage for your labour, with no profits going to management or shareholders. You will not be paid in dollars. You will not spend dollars. You will be able to spend the new currency of the people for services and goods. You will not have bank accounts. You will not have to trust or rely on the systems of power and control that have repressed you in the past. Instead of investing in stocks, you will invest in people. Instead of working for a subsistence wage, you will work for a bountiful life, with support for all you need to thrive and grow. But, to embrace this future means that you will abandon the dollar. You will have to renounce the shackles of false corporate money. You will have to renounce the concept of dollar debt. You will have to choose to be free, and choosing to be free will take incredible willpower. It will take understanding the lies and the hallucinations of wealth, money, and the corporatocracy that you have been indoctrinated with since you were a child. However, if you can understand it, when the DAOs come, you will be able to be free.",a5br3k,self.socialism,,True

The Truth About Capitalism,socialism,"Hello, I am a student in a Peace Psychology course and I hope it is ok that I share this project here. I also did a 1 page write-up with it, I guess I'll paste that here: &#x200B; I believe that capitalism (competition) is the most dangerous and harmful structural violence schema that we have ever known. The ephemera I created has two key focal points: 1) A passage from a letter to Coretta Scott, written by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 2) A hand squeezing money from Earth. I included King’s very personal words (to his girlfriend at the time) because of his awareness and contemplation of a healthy economy. He took into consideration the usefulness of capitalism especially after witnessing the cruel and destructive power of it. I think that the socialist preferences, shared by Karl Marx and King, were largely detested merely because of these mens favor for them; It is a truly sad and ridiculous thing to think that people did not reason for themselves simply because they are so hateful to others. King further developed his stance to challenge “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism,” all of which are forms of competition. I drew the hand large to portray control and the vice-like grip of capitalism. I really just want people to wake up so I think I’m making things pretty clear here. There’s a question I started using to challenge critical thought, it goes something like this, “If you were to go back in time to a slave plantation and looked around to see each captive is depressed, do you give them Prozac or freedom?” I believe that we’re still getting Prozac. Cooperation is the key to a healthy future. All of my being tells me that knowledge is power, and so this post will be shared on reddit.com to empower the world. &#x200B; Thank you!

It's very interesting to read, especially as I like History, and Engels makes a materialist analysis of history (for example he claims that the invention of fire allowed humans to cook fish, which allowed them to settle and explore new areas by following rivers and coastlines) but his book was written in 1884 using sources of his time... is it still considered true?

Building dual power.,socialism,"Comrades, I believe that in order to build a socialist society, one of the things that is paramount is to build a socialist culture and socialist institutions. To accomplish this, it would seem that we would need to begin by building a Socialist State in minature. By this, I don't mean like a commune or an intentional community. I mean building dual power. Creating organizations and institutions that take part in mutual aid, organization, education, and democratic decision making.

Then theres the possibilty of working within the existing unions like IWW and having a united front of many parties which I see as preferable. Even if we only use it for some reforms, entryism would boom with a big socialist party. Personally not a fan of democratic centralism and the tendency of inner party members to devolve into beaucracy. But anything is preferable to the current disorganized state of the left.

Brazil situation and Free Lula International Commitee,socialism,"So, I guess some of you already know, but some may not, many things happened in Brazil in the last two years that culminated with Bolsonaro's election last october, our legitimate president Dilma Rousseff was victim of a coup, promoted by the parliament, in order to place Michel Temer, her vice-president and a neoliberal scumbag in her place. Since 2017 ex-president Lula has been victim of lawfare and in April 4th, 2018 he was arrested, even so, PT (Worker's Party) decided to insist in his presidential campaign as the polls showed that he would win in all scenarios with a MASSIVE disparity against his biggest opponent and now elected president Jair Bolsonaro, in the end he wasn't allowed to run for the presidency in a fierce decision by the Supreme Court. His vice-president Fernando Haddad was chosen to run in his place, and even though he was unknown to most people he achieved a second round against Bolsonaro, in which he lost after being victim of the most outrageous allegations (such as owning a Ferrari, throwing a Bible in the trash can, raping a girl and many more, which I will be dealing with in another post) After all that my point is: Lula's prison is also a prison to all Brazilian left, Lula symbolizes EVERYTHING that the right-wing does not want. Lula was an iliterate factory worker, as president he rose Brazil into 6th biggest economy in the world (in 2012) surpassing the United Kingdom, he erradicated hunger and reduced poverty in Brazil by 50,6%, also rose Petrobras (Brazil state oil company) in the end of his office in 2010 as the 4th biggest oil company in the world. &#x200B;  All those advances were considered a threat, and that's a particularity about Lula, while being the most profitable president in Brazil's history, ALL STATE REVENUE was destined to social equality programs such as Bolsa Familia, SUS (Unified Health System, inspired by the United Kingdom's National Health Service) and many more. In the end I ask to all socialist comrades, that are worried about this reactionary plague that has been ravaging all over the world, beware of what has been happening here in Brazil, we will not surrender and Lula will be freed but take notice that this may be just the first of many cases. We are also leading a campaign for his nomination to Nobel Peace Prize, which already has more than 430.000 signatures, to more information and how to sign go to  &#x200B;  &#x200B;",ab1k9o,self.socialism,,True

We are worried about the end of the month.” >The climate movement, because of its roots in environmentalism, with its skepticism about “growthmania,” has had a hard time consistently embracing and implementing climate solutions as steps towards equity and prosperity.

You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.' James 5:1-6 This is a firm condemnation of exploitation by the ruling class, and a message of hope to the poor and oppressed. Worry not because judgement is coming. Our goal as Communists/Socialists/Anarchists is to end that exploitation. I personally find as I become more radical in my communism my religious faith is also strengthened. Why else would we be communists if G-d didn't wish us to end exploitation? Why would They send many servants among us to say as much, if not so that we might heed them and create revolution?

Luke is a kid that goes through most of the monomyth journey of new hope...till he realizes that the people behind the rebellion are the elder houses(in canon the former nobility of the galaxy before the Bourgeois revolution replaced them with a oligarchal old republic that frankly isn't much better, they are using anti-fascist sentiment to set up a roman empire style federation that supports the reestablishment of galactic monarchy with a ceremonial galactic senate but with the local monarchs carrying all the real power like the emperor of the Republic keeping the Senate around). As a result he joins his father, who is basically a radical socialist whose childhood slavery and current medical problems(charred lungs) made him sympathetic to the plight of the working class whom the capitalist Palpatine exploits. Leia is trained as a jedi(a counter-revolutionary conservative aristocrat who joins a religion that is largely passive and conservative who is in love with capitalist Han solo) and Luke is trained as a sith(sith are more emotional and progressive and flexible than the jedi and were formed to be the active progressive side to the jedi's conservative passive side, the force is split between tranquility represented by the light and active energy and emotion and desires represented by the dark...no more dualism between good or evil, just 2 sets of universal principles that are interchangeable in morality). Palpatine is killed by Vader with the help of Luke in a means similar to snoke and Vader becomes emperor, but the empire is split in 2 because of Vader taxing the capitalists and strengthening the unions and giving Droids civil rights, now they are throwing their full weight behind leia's counter revolutionary forces in exchange for lower taxes and weaker unions and a return to the natural subservient status of Droids. Return of the jedi will be a far different film...one with messy family drama and a politically complicated war that stars a Darth Vader who must be forced to restore the Senate by Luke(Luke is a democratic socialist who believes in free elections while Vader views himself as a philosopher king who knows best) a Leia who must learn to think for herself, a complex Web of 2 competing classes fighting for supremacy(bourgeoisie and the elder houses) and c3po and R2 watching the carnage in the background.",a9n2ui,self.socialism,,True

Was Anarres really anarchist?,socialism,"A book I hold very dear to my heart, and radicalised me towards Anarchism/Libertarian Socialism is Ursula K Le Guin's The Dispossessed. The society on Anarres fascinated me greatly and led me to read her other works based in the Hainish/Ekumen universe, with other great works such as The Left Hand of Darkness and The Word for World is Forest - which I highly recommend. One thing I've always been confused about though is how Anarres is meant to be anarchist, since: 1) the society is closed off, has it's own planet and strict borders. Nobody is allowed to leave or enter except mineral exporters that transport minerals off-world to Ideas in exchange for other goods. 2) hasn't completely gotten rid of hierarchy since it has some sort of central committee which acts like quasi-judicial panel. 3) Is incredibly suspicious of different opinions and dissent to the point it ostracizes those who are different. 4) still has some form of prison system. They don't overtly call it that in the book, but it's pretty obvious one of the characters is sent to one for 'psychological evaluation'. 5) Anarres survives by the grace of Urras, which can invade at any time and therefore can you say that the Anarresi are truly free? I also don't understand how the society is seen as an example of Anarcho-Syndicalism, since there are no trade unions. It strikes me more that they practice a form of communism. Obviously, no society can be truly perfect or free, and I understand Le Guin's message was to show that revolution is a constant battle. What are your opinions?",a9oy5o,self.socialism,,True

"Against Conventional Wisdom: On Violence, Leadership, Protest, and the Gilets Jaunes",socialism," Americans have been taught that for protest to be effective it has to always be nonviolent and must always have strong leadership. We treat violence against property and violence done in self-defense as the same as violence against people. We condemn the protester who throws a tear gas canister back at the police who shot it at the protesters head, never commenting on the initial act of violence. Even those who dissent worry about 'violent' protesters, while ignoring brutal cops. And, if the protesters don't have formal leadership! Oh my, do we freak out! This mind frames makes it difficult to comprehend what is happening in the Paris protests. Those who read the English-language press accounts of the Gilets Jaunes get doubly confused when confronted with the fact that the Gilets have wrung major concessions out of Macron because they refuse to back down (which means engaging in violence against property and in self defense) and because they have no formal leaders to sell them out.

Socialism to aim higher in its demands: Hope!,socialism,"In these days the material problem has been solved: to provide a sustainable means of feeding all, and to build homes for each without overcrowding. The distribution problem remains, and is more callous than it has been before. But it is nobody's fault, it is the reflection of inevitably: Nobody has set out any bounds for those who are ascribed most funds, nor could anyone have set out such bounds. It was the factory which caused so much of our growth, and yes, so much of that growth went directly to those who owned the factories. And this a vile period in many ways, beautiful in too many others to count or observe... and the course of the factory was set by plain Darwinist effect so independently from the hands of anyone's control. Had ever a capitalist not been ruthless, their factory would bust, their tenants left then unemployed, and any other with capital, more happy to extract at human cost... these would have surely filled that spot left by the sub-optimal, yet compassionate capitalist. These are not those times. The capitalist scarcely exists as the one who joins forces and divides tasks, but something scarier and, actually way easier to navigate: The politicians are not in charge of their companies, the CEOs are not in charge of their countries, the shareholders are irrelevant anonymous, and yet these three groups are bolstered. &#x200B; I will continue at another time, socialism has grown as it has become more compassionate. There is no class, there is no class war, the 'Bourgeois' if they own less than a house they are not bourgoise, and even those on £100k a year have very often to work a year of 4800 hours and at the end not have gained anything from their encounter, after 4800 hours of deference. There is no wealth or resource created by money but only poverty, as well we know. Whilst most have less than £100,000 it is easy to see that as a lot, but I say fair begins at 200,000pa. Then you can live in a house, have recreation, \*and\* have something to put forward for your efforts. £1m a year is not a lot in these days, it's just few have access to it... a problem not solved by governments or the rich but the person who lays the plans and advocated it well-enough. &#x200B; Our world moves about £1m per person per day, in not tight circles but none-the-less exclusive circles. It is missing from the effective economy, and it is nothing but a distribution problem. Anyone who could work a year and not find themselves substantially and securely in a better situation than that where they began, they are serfs and \*must\* be freed in our agenda. Anyone who ever has reasonable fear of hunger, homelessness, or poverty in their lifetime whilst they too work 40 hours a week, then their position is considerably worse than a grecian slave's, or a feudal serf's, outside of dramatic and rare instances of unbridled animosity between landowner and tenant... &#x200B; And so a majority effort of future socialism is that our goal is to raise literacy. And a grand part of it is to empathise with the situation of the haplessly over-rich. And a task for ourselves is to hope so much higher. £100,000 is pittance today,(not that many of us here have that). Everyone should have at least that.ORR we separate financialism from food and housing completely, I find both feasible and the latter to achieve regardless.Requiring money to eat is worse than requiring a once-off license. The winds of change do blow. Salutations, companions. Salaam, &#x200B; Ah, and, it is plain falsity to spend effort on what one cannot oneself effect.

Why is the Federal Reserve overlooked by so many on the left?,socialism,"It seems as though the issue of the Federal Reserve, and for that matter, monetary policy in general isn't discussed by any of the popular left-wing commentators. For those who aren't aware of what the Fed is, it's a private corporation created by Congress in 1913 to control interest rates and the money supply. Since the creation of the Fed, the dollar can only purchase $0.03 of what it could in 1913. The Federal Reserve steals the purchasing power of the worker by printing money (inflation), creating asset bubbles (or at very least greatly contributing to them) like the dot-com crash and 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the Fed fattens the paycheques of the bankers, while simultaneously stripping the worker of his/her purchasing power over time. Not to mention all of the debt, quantitative easing and money printing that has been happening in ALL of the worlds central banks. To me, this seems like the greatest scam in history and the fact that no popular people on the left cover this or even acknowledge the Fed much at all is shocking. To me, this is the most important issue of our time and we should all take a deeper look to understand it the best we can.

Expressing Myself,socialism,"I know Im blunt with the title, I have come to express myself about some things. I want to give some context first. First, I was born in the United Kingdom and my ethnicity is Indian. My Grandparents came here because my Grandfather had served the British Army during WW2 as a Office clerk. Also, I can assume they left because the mess the new Indian Republic was in. Partition and having to sort out the problems left by British Imperialism would be a reasonable motive to leave. Common rhetoric from the Right-Wing find it horrible that the 1945 Labour Government allowed Immigrants, from Most Commonwealth Nations, to come here to rebuild Britain. That makes my ears bleed. Socialism rebuilt Britain after the War. Many Young British males had died during the war. Thus, there was not enough manpower to rebuild the country. Believe me guys, Socialism is the reason why Britain was rebuilt and thrived. Most of you should know that the 1945 Labour government had Nationalised Industry and the Health Service (The NHS). Among all the Government had Nationalised, I find these 2 to be the most important. Though respecting my Grandfather for his service to the UK, I can never forgive him for his abusive, neglectful treatment of my own father who came to the UK in 1968, age 7. However, my Grandparents were traditional, the good part of that was their outstanding work ethic. For example, my Grandfather worked a Job from 6 in the morning to 6 in the Evening. One of the things I can admire about my Grandfather was his willingness to get a job and be a provider to his family, that I can be very thankful for. Now onto my Dad and this is where I realised, in my edgy, capitalist phase, how socialism really helped my family. During the 70's, under Harold Wilson's government, there was still the nationalised Industry. Because of which, my dad got his first job immediately is a separate debate. But, back then Immigrant like my Grandfather/Father were necessary to rebuild the country. All that labour and they got hate/Racism from the then-conservative, capitalist establishment? Fuck them. Now onto my Dad and this is where I realised, in my edgy, capitalist phase, how socialism really helped my family. During the 70's, under Harold Wilson's government, there was still the nationalised Industry. Because of which, my dad got his first job immediately in a steel factory. He was 16 and had left school. Soon, he was working and he was a really, really good worker. Not in terms of wanting just pay, put the very act of working my dad loved. He's always said to me that He just loved to work, to work with people and so on. So good was he, that one time the people from the factory literally drove to his house, knocked on the door and specially requested him to come because he was that good of a worker. You see, Socialism does that special thing to people. It gives them jobs and gives them a sense of working towards the common good. Unlike Capitalism, fucking Exploiting the worker for his Labour-power and making the Worker feel depressed, Alienated. How dare they do that. Seeing my dad as a good worker makes me proud of who I am. Damn, I wish sometimes I had the work-ethic my Dad had. &#x200B; Now, the problems of the shitty system. &#x200B; Thanks to fucking Thatcher, Privatisation took place and My Dad was unemployed for most of the 80's and the early 90's. Wow, the champion of Private Capital took away what meant most to my father. Ill never forget what Thatcherism did to the UK in those days, even if I did not live thorough them. &#x200B; Soon, it's thanks to the State that my Dad got another job as a Receptionist in the City Council. He worked there for 22 years, still the great worker I looked up to. Even as a small boy, I remember a drawing of me and my mom outside of our house, with a stick-figure of my dad, in a tie, going to work. Man, I feel sad. Those were good days. I thank Socialism again. &#x200B; How about these times now? The Uk is messed up. For my Dad, he lost his job in 2013 and ever since then he has been unemployed. He's suffered stokes, moderately depressed, suicidal at times and has got into arguments with my Mom. Who, is working as carer for the elderly on a zero-hour contract. Thank fuck she does get a lot of hours. Man, it's just sad. I feel like the conditions in the Uk, and the whole of Europe, should set the conditions for Socialist Revolutions, not the Conservative/Right-wing populism we see today, that makes it worse. &#x200B; It's even hypocritical for the Conservatives/Right-wing, they say they are against the establishment but the Establishment is inherently favouring the Capitalist Mode of Production. How are they Anti-Establishment? thinking bringing back the old social order will help. Oh fuck no!!! &#x200B; The workers struggle is a universal Struggle. No matter what race, sex, religion you are (I am against Ideas such as Identity Politics, White privilege as I feel like they divide the left, all the demands from the these ideologies are guaranteed in Socialism). &#x200B; Again, thank you Labour, thank you Socialism for all the things you had done for my country. One day, socialism will come back to the UK. That day is more nearer now as it seems. &#x200B; Thank you for reading. &#x200B; Have a nice day. ",a8yfzy,self.socialism,,True

Looking for books/articles on socialism in practice on the societal level,socialism,"Most books on socialism/communism written in the last 20 years seem to be primarily about criticizing capitalism or analyzing the theoretical underpinnings of some version of socialism. I haven't found many that comprehensively put forth ideas for how to structure society in a socialist way, from bottom to top. At least not in the past 20 years, as I said. There are some books here and there where the last couple of chapters are about what could be possible after capitalism (Richard D. Wolff's *Democracy at Work*, for example), but not too many that really explore all the options and their pros and cons. Marx said that communism isn't a rigidly defined way of running society, but the tangible process of workers deciding for themselves how it should be run, so I get that there may not be much use in dwelling on some utopian vision when we should be organizing. But as a way of providing hypothetical support for a future society in discussions and debates, it'd be useful to have a resource for the kinds of life that have been envisioned by socialists in the contemporary age of information technology.

I plan to keep reading it, but I worry that not enough time will be dedicated to the left in their criticisms of basic income; already, he has lambasted the notion that there is any reason to oppose it solely on the grounds that rich capitalists like Elon Musk apparently support it. While I hesitantly agree this may not be a *sufficient* reason to abandon it, this comment tells me the author might not appreciate class as a genuine factor in the discussion. If possible, I'd like to know if anybody on the left has written a book arguing AGAINST basic income, because it seems like there is no comprehensive resource available for criticisms on those grounds--all the critiques are of the boring 'but nobody will work if they aren't afraid of starvation' variety.

The near-future is right wing..,socialism,"Firstly, sorry for the bait-ish title. Secondly, this is just a rant, I'm not sure I really have a cohesive point to make. So I only discovered today that the Azov Regiment in Ukraine (the Neo-Nazi one that is training child soldiers to be hate-filled and murderous towards whatever enemy is decided for them) isn't just a football hooligan faction that took up arms during a civil war, but they are now a legitimate branch of the Ukrainian army. I also found out that the US has only just this year stopped supporting them based on their White Supremacist agenda, but they had been supporting them since 2014 despite people in the US Congress repeatedly voting not to, just because they're an enemy of America's enemy despite it always being obvious they're a Neo-Nazi faction. At the same time though, far-left groups get denounced instantaneously as being communists in an age where it no longer exists to be smeared and discredited without ever even seeing Washington's check book. If one was to get involved in the Ukrainian Civil War to fight against a fascist faction taking hold in Europe, what would be the point? The opposition to them is only going to be right wing as well anyway, as there are no nations left who would support a left-wing faction because clearly the heroic and free west would rather fund Neo-Nazi's in their international cock-fights, while crushing anyone who threatens their power at home. With this in mind, I feel the future is just going to be a fight between the right-wing and alt-right about where the line is supposed to be drawn with a modern interpretation of fascism.",a42bbf,self.socialism,,True

I feel like the french gouvernement is acting in a illogical way,socialism,"What they are doing now is trying to calm the protesters by reforms and money of the people (taxes and fees) and not with the wealthy. Want examples? Earlier this year, they took away 5€ the APL (a financiary help for renting an apartment). I looked, and for some people 5€ represented 2,08% of their help. Now apply a 2,08 % tax on ministers. A minister's salary is 10000€ / months, so it makes a tax of 208€. 208€ × 12 months × 22 ministers = almost 55 000€. Easily. But undone because it is funnier taxing the poors right? Another example : the 'fiscal evasion' (not sure if it is that in english), the fact that big companies have bank accounts away to never pay taxes : 80 millon € / year. Just make the big companies respect the laws and 80M € easily ! They're leaving? No problem, let's promote our own companies; the state is promoting QWant over Google, do it totally! Another example? The deleting of the tax on wealth. Just why? People and state needs money. Wealthy people have money. So let's stop taking away money from the wealthy people!

The Nepal Communist Party and People's Multiparty Democracy.,socialism,"So I already somewhat mentioned this in another thread, but I wanted to expand the discussion a bit more on this topic. So, for those who are not aware, Nepal is currently governed by the Nepal Communist Party, which is an amalgam of other Communist Parties (many ML and Maoist based). They currently govern a multi-party democracy and believe this to be a natural development of Marxism-Leninism in Nepal. However, some other ML parties around the world believe that the Nepal Communist Party are revisionists due to their approach to multiparty democracy and mainstream politics. The worst criticisms paint them as a SocDem party with a Hammer n' Sickle logo. The reason this fascinates me is because it goes against the grain of pretty much every other ML state in history. The Nepal Communist Party is the ruling party, but it is not constitutionally bound as the ruling party. It allows for open elections and yet has still managed to remain in the majority. It admits issues with the current system but believe it to be the best method forward when compared to the alternatives. Comrades (including MLs), I'd like to know your thoughts on this.",ab29rg,self.socialism,,True

Resources on Socialist Economics,socialism,"Hello, I've begun studying economics (not at a university, just on my own) and am using a decidedly non-socialist text to begin (Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell) mainly for the reason that he is a clear writer and it is an easy introduction to economic ideas, and also that I have no problem engaging with ideas that I may disagree with. I'm not a socialist, and find many of his arguments about, for example, price controls, fairly convincing. Since I am just beginning my study of the topic, I'm interested in understanding common ways that socialist economics is approached, what the options are, and how they are argued and supported. So, I'm asking for sources that can give insight into that. I'm sure there are many 'types' of socialist economics; I'm just looking for something serious and deep but introductory. I'm well versed enough in mathematics and game theory to be able to understand texts with technical content so long as it isn't overwhelming. For what it's worth, I have a lot of sympathy for socialist ideas, but am curious about their proper implementation and how they can work properly given what I believe about how humans function. I'm unaffiliated with any political party or ideology for the most part, and have benefited greatly from a variety of common-ownership entities, like monasteries and the kibbutzim my parents grew up on. Anyways, whatever you got is appreciated! EDIT: I'm specifically looking for stuff on centrally-planned economies, but other non-centrally planned socialist economic ideas, like how market activity can interact with subsidization in various sectors is also a big interest.

A couple questions regarding Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.,socialism,"Hello, I just finished Socialism: Utopian and Scientific and I had a couple questions: 1. Engels mentions that before a Proletarian revolution, the means of production will be first acquired by the State, showing the superfluous nature of the bourgeoisie. After that, the revolution will occur when the proletariat takes the state and dissolves it. This last step has no semblance of happening. In fact, neoliberalism keeps trying to privatize public industry. How would this expropriation of the public sector into state capitalism work? Is there any chance something like that will happen in the post-neoliberal world? 2. Engels mentions that one of the contradictions in capitalism is the socialized organization in a factory mixed with social anarchy in production as a whole. Can someone please clarify what this contradiction means? Thank you in advance.",aapwx0,self.socialism,,True

I'm also curious about the pervasiveness of committed leftists, both towards the statist and towards the anarchist tendancies, vs the general population numbers. On top of that, I'm aware there are some far removed guy elements pushing to capitalise on this too. What efforts are being made from within the protests to tackle them?

Normalizing a revolution,socialism,"Personally, I can't speak for everyone, but as most people who live in United States, I use to believe that concepts like, socialism, and communism were unthinkable.

Now by definition I would consider myself a left libertarian. What prompted my change from liberal to socialist was oddly enough another liberal, Bernie Sanders, and his idea of social democracies influenced largely by the Scandinavian nations. Even though he isn't a real socialist, and really only seeks to amend capitalism, he liberated that word from its' negative connotation, for me, and probably other countless Americans. &#x200B; The Revolution, and/or reform will never come under the current circumstances of the Overton window.

Surprisingly the customer turns out to be the notorious gang MS-13. When asked about the possible issues involved with supplying weapons to such a group the president replied, “I know some people have called them ‘Bad Hombres’ said they were rapist and murderers but I’ve always said that some of them are probably good people. They denied murdering anyone. Are they lying? Who Knows, we’ll probably never know but Germany and Gina would love to get that money and I’m not going to just leave it on the table. I’m all about America First.” He also announced the opening of a large new pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. “By reducing regulations that have discouraged investment we have brought manufacturing jobs back to the United States. This new plant will be manufacturing Fentanyl to supply an exploding market for it in India and Asia” Once again he was asked about the wisdom of this in light of the opioid epidemic and he replied, “Their production is for export only; none of it will be sold here at home.” Finally he announced that his economic development team is looking into easing regulations that have all but destroyed a group of businesses in the film industry. “These film makers have been essentially put out of business and locked out of a market worth billions of dollars a year just because they cater to a niche genre. The Philippines is killing us and now leading the world in kiddie porn films. That’s millions of dollars and thousands of jobs that Americans are losing out on.” One reporter asked if he had considered the possibility that in exporting so much misery some of it might find its way back into the U.S. He said, “That’s why we need to get the wall built.

(Kind-of) Theory Question: Confused about the boss/worker dichotomy,socialism,"One thing I often see around is basic socialist definitions of working-class/Proletarian and Bourgeoise which AFAIK posits the Bourgeoise, 'the bosses', as a group who take a cut of their worker's wealth while undergoing less labour and commanding authority of those workers. A lot of the time in socialist circles you hear 'workers' and 'bosses' being discussed as totally separate entities, and that bosses are completely irredeemable for having exploited the labour of workers. However as I go into the workplace, I'm finding this doesn't line up with what I'm seeing. For one thing, there seems to layers of bosses, bosses have their own bosses and seem to have their labour exploited as well, and even face abuse. There is clear overlap between the sphere of bosses and workers that contradicts the common idea online that it would all be fine if we just guillotined all the bosses. Also does that mean that if I were promoted to say, a sub-manager, that I would immediately become part of the bourgeois class?

"I know religion and socialism are not exactly the best of buddies, but it is in socialists best interest for more religious holidays at companies like Amazon.",socialism,"Captialism fundamentally works on forcing people to a timetable, through punishing people for deviating from that timetable. The complete ascent of Capitalism in the modern era saw a decline in religious holidays. In the Renaissance and Early Modern era, religious holidays were plentiful. With industrialisation these were curbed and every micro minute of workers lives slowly became managed. With more free time, it forces Capitalists onto the backfoot. If the likes of Bezo's give some religious free holidays but not others, they open themselves up to lawsuits. By pushing for more religious holidays and such, it is the first step in getting workers into more of a negotiating pattern. Rationalism is good but it can unfortunately also lend itself to reduced workers rights through 'efficiency' (which always comes at the bottom end and never the top end).",a6uj7v,self.socialism,,True

How metaphysically should the labor theory of value be considered in Marx?,socialism," So I'm 400 pages into Capital, and I thought I mostly understood it. However this question has been bothering me. Is the 'value' of a commodity put into it by labor it's price on the market as determined by use-value + surplus value absorbed by the capitalist, or is the amount of labor put into an object it's 'value,' and how much does that have to do with the price of the commodity on the market? I was under the impression that the value of an object given to it by labor was metaphysical, held higher than the social system itself. The reason Marx phrases it like this is to make it clear how exploitative the Capitalists are being. I would also imagine it has to do with Hegel's idea of how the oppressed seek recognition through work after being unable to find it in the master class, although I'm not smart enough for this shit.

Question about why labor union officers will screw over their membership,socialism,"For those of you who are in the US, you're probably familiar with the wave of teacher strikes that went down about half a year ago. They're pretty much over now, with most of the teachers not happy about what contract their union settled for. It's been a common occurrence to see the officers of labor unions either not consulting the membership on contracts, or only partly consulting them, or partly informing them. We've seen this happen more recently with the autoworker disillusionment with their unions like the United Auto Workers(UAW). And again, most of the union members feel that the union officers have settled it in with corporate management, rather than defending their rights. So my question is, what's there for a typical union president/officer to gain? I doubt the corporations directly donate to their paychecks, because if dirt like that was uncovered, there would be a huge scandal. If it isn't that, then what could they possibly gain? &#x200B; Any thoughts? I need help comrades. &#x200B;  ",a4gu4f,self.socialism,,True

People that think Trotsky was considerably better than Stalin fail to read a lot of his work,socialism,"‘We still retain, and for a long time will retain, the system of wages. The further we go, the more will its importance become simply to guarantee to all members of society all the necessaries of life; and thereby it will cease to be a system of wages. But at present we are not sufficiently rich for this. Our main problem is to raise the quantity of products turned out, and to this problem all the remainder must be subordinated. In the present difficult period the system of wages is for us, first and foremost, not a method for guaranteeing the personal existence of any separate worker, but a method of estimating what that individual worker brings by his labor to the Labor Republic.’ ‘Consequently, comrades, militarization of labor, in the root sense indicated by me, is not the invention of individual politicians or an invention of our War Department, but represents the inevitable method of organization and disciplining of labor-power during the period of transition from capitalism to Socialism. And if the compulsory distribution of labor-power, its brief or prolonged retention at particular industries and factories, its regulation within the framework of the general State economic plan – if these forms of compulsion lead always and everywhere, as the Menshevik resolution states, to the lowering of productivity, then you can erect a monument over the grave of Socialism. For we cannot build Socialism on decreased production. Every social organization is in its foundation an organization of labor, and if our new organization of labor leads to a lowering of its productivity, it thereby most fatally leads to the destruction of the Socialist society we are building, whichever way we twist and turn, whatever measures of salvation we invent.’ ‘Naturally, it is quite clear that the State must, by means of the bonus system, give the better workers better conditions of existence. But this not only does not exclude, but on the contrary pre-supposes, that the State and the trade unions without which the Soviet State will not build up industry acquire new rights of some kind over the worker. The worker does not merely bargain with the Soviet State: no, he is subordinated to the Soviet State, under its orders in every direction – for it is his State.’  ",a5xao2,self.socialism,,True

"IWW statement of solidarity with workers in Sweden, where social democrats are working to introduce laws amounting to a ban on strikes for independent unions",socialism," The IWW expresses its solidarity with SAC – Syndikalisterna, other grassroots unions, and Swedish workers. We note that the Swedish government, in collaboration with big business and mainstream trade unions are proposing legislation that would severely restrict the right of workers to take industrial action in defence of their interests. We consider this attack on Swedish workers as a form of class war more to be expected from authoritarian regimes than from a social democratic government and union bureaucracies who are in clear collaboration with the capitalist class. In particular it will be illegal for Swedish unions to engage in strikes or other forms of action, including handing out leaflets outside a workplace for any other purpose than not having a collective bargaining agreement with an employer. The only recourse for discrimination or illegal sackings will now be a flawed labour court system. It will be illegal to engage in a strike to get a collective bargaining agreement if a union is “known to not usually sign or hold” such an agreement. It will also be illegal to strike to get a collective bargaining agreement if there is already a collective bargaining agreement with another union – even if they have no members in the workplace or sector. These proposals will severely reduce the potential for independent solidarity unions to take industrial action of any kind. They also enable employers to create their own yellow unions or to incite unions organising the same workplaces into competition that suits the employer rather than the workers. These proposals contravene ILO conventions ratified by Sweden in the 1940s as well as European Convention articles on the right to free association and the right to union organisation. The IWW extends solidarity and applauds Swedish unions and workers who have taken to the streets in recent months in an effort to resist these reactionary proposals becoming law. Representatives from Danish and Norwegian unions have also campaigned at home as well as attending protests in Stockholm. In recent decades the struggle against the restriction of union rights has become central to the global class war and it must therefore always be waged internationally.

We must make liberalism as unacceptable as conservatism to defeat fascism in America.,socialism,"The democratic party is quite arguably the greatest danger for fascist uprising other than fascism itself. the Neo-liberal democratic establishment appropriates progressive, leftist movements of varying degrees, waters them down, and kills them. Be it Unions, Occupy, Fighting for wages, Black Lives Matter, the list goes on. In the last two years we've seen from the rise of Trump not only a terrible presidency, but in fact a growing alt right, proto fascist movement bigger than Trump himself and that will exist past his relevancy. We have seen the Democratic party become the pro war party, the party of Cold War McCarthyism, of embracing and romanticizing war criminals like George W Bush, we've seen neo-liberalism destroy leftist movements. Even the libertarians, the crowd of socially sane conservatives that we could at least find common ground with against foreign wars and establishment politics has been corrupted by the alt right, and this illusion of Trump being 'anti-globalist', and of 'cultural marxism' or 'PC Culture' taking over. We must make it as disgusting, as unnaceptable, as evil to the young people of America to support the Democratic Party as it is the Republican Party. We must open their eyes to that radical socialism, radical anti-fascism, and radical anti-establishment. We must make it blatantly clear that the Democratic party exploiting the plights and sympathies of the marginalized and oppressed is destructive to those groups, that we should not be embracing democrats taking on issues of people of color, women, people of the LGBTQ, refugees, as they are speaking broken promises. No, they should fear embracement from the Democratic party, it should be seen as Trojan Horse. We must kill Neo-liberalism, or we will not have a movement to fight fascism. The democratic establishment is sly, methodical, and souless, but it underestimates the power of hatred, the power of crypo-fascistic ideologues that have arisen in this country. They are not taking the threat seriously. &#x200B; My question is you, how can we destroy neo-liberalism?

I left after the first year and it's still thriving now. &#x200B; Fast forward to today: I want to do the minimum possible thing that allows bringing on colleague-practitioners (fellow programmers or other artisans/craftspeople) over time. It has to be 'for profit' (according to the US State Dept who issues the visa) which is not the spirit I'm going for. Basically I want to simulate a co-op/commune within the standard corporate legal structure. Will maybe pay myself and whoever joins with 100% commission or salary or dividends indexed to direct revenue generated (like a producer co-op), pay the taxes, government pension fund, (un)employment insurance, healthcare etc. Even though co-ops can be 'for profit', they require at least 3 people to incorporate, and I would prefer to let that happen naturally rather than go find people just so I can continue working normally. Each time somebody joins in, we can re-dilute to equal ~~member~~ownership (with a rule for tie-break votes if ~~member~~ownership is an even number). And somehow the policies for pay equity, democratic decision making, employee/owner governance, living wages, anti-harassment etc. are all so strongly encoded that random rent seeking douches/bootlickers, if they ever weasel their way into the mix somehow, could never engineer repeals of the worker 'rights'. &#x200B; How to exist as a craftsperson in league with fellow workers but still maintain the capability to exchange the produce for money within the current system? How to be an actually socialist company without using alternative legal structures, is that a contradiction? If not, how can it be protected from hostile takeover by capitalists, prevent future managers from being or acting like imperialists, racists, misogynists etc.? Something special in the articles/bylaws? Third-party certifications like b-corp (which I don't personally trust to not just be co-opting ethics for marketing purposes)? Is 'fair trade' actually a thing? Anything interesting about different classes of shares (voting, non-voting, something special)? Are there federations of other similar companies? Is parliamentary procedure (like Robert's Rules) a useful tool? What kind of governance makes sense? How to control/limit corruption and campaigning once ~~member~~ownership gets big enough to generate politicians? &#x200B; edit 1: formatting",a3j6ak,self.socialism,,True

Americans really are just a whisker away from death and poverty,socialism,"This is more of a venting post than anything, but what I need to vent about wouldn’t even happen if there were a semi-decent social safety net in the US. So I take care of adults with disabilities for a living. It’s criminally underpaid, thankless work. I stick around for the people. The benefits aren’t really that great. I’ve got a couple coworkers. One is a single mother(call her D), the other is a woman in her early 20s(B). B had cancer a few years ago, it’s been in remission but doctors refused to perform the hysterectomy needed to fully remove the cancer because they wanted her to keep the option of having kids. She has absolutely zero interest in this and really just wanted the cancer gone. Fast forward to now, she’s been having the same symptomology she had when the cancer first started. She went through chemo and swears up and down she’s never doing it again. For the life of me, I cannot even begin to comprehend what the doctors thought process was. I’m no doctor, but it seems totally idiotic and patriarchal to say “keep your uterus because you may want kids, even though you say otherwise and it almost killed you” D is a single mom with a grade school aged son. Her ex boyfriend is abusive and her mother is in no place to help her out. She recently started having some strange symptoms and went to the doctor. Turns out she has lupus and was ordered to stay home from work for a few weeks. This isn’t really an option for her from a financial perspective. Disability insurance only pays 2/3 wages, and takes some time to kick in. I have no idea what’s going to happen with her living situation, and she doesn’t either. She’s been coming in to work anyway and doing what she can. These stories are pretty common. It’s an absolute travesty that things like this are even allowed to occur. The blatant greed from the ownership class tells us fixing these things would cost too much, while at the same time turning around an lobbying to lower their tax bill. The people that are most impacted are kept poor sick and scared. Why revolt if you would lose what little you already have? If you’re an illness away from death or poverty, why would you rock the boat and risk it all? Especially when the individualist attitude tells us that we’re on our own and pits us against each other.

What happens if the partial shutdown never ends?,socialism,"Not that it matters to me, since I am an anti-statist, but based on the Trump’s pattern of behavior in several previous engagements, (including NATO, COP24, ending TPP, imposing steel and aluminum tarrifs, ending NAFTA, withdrawing from Syria over his advisors protests, and imposing tariffs on China, etc.), I think folks may be underestimating how this border wall skirmish with Pelosi unfolds. Trump acts so outside the normal parameters of the Washington consensus, people tend not to take him seriously until it is too late. I think this is what the democrats are doing in the partial shutdown. We might be looking at a 60 to 90 day partial shutdown in Washington before Pelosi realize Trump is serious and capitulates, perhaps longer. Of course, I could be wrong. But months with a partial government shutdown is becoming less rare in the advanced countries. Northern Ireland, for instance, at one point went 14 months without a government; while Belgium went 541 days deadlocked.

Clearing up Trotsky’s “Permanent Revolution” theory. It ain’t just for Trots.,socialism,"Trotsky’s Theory of Permanent Revolution (TPR) may be his most misunderstood theory. Oftentimes it is conflated with his criticism of Stalin’s Socialism in One Country strategy for building the Soviet Union from feudal agricultural backwater to industrial superpower. The point of this post isn’t to talk about the Soviet Union however, as TPR doesn’t have much to do with the USSR at all! Actually that isn’t necessarily true but I’ll get to that at the end of the post. All the TPR means is that in countries that experience combined and uneven development (basically developing countries that have large segments of pre-capitalist production with pockets of advanced capitalist production), the bourgeoisie is gonna be too comfy in the hybrid system to have their own revolution to go full capitalism. The example of combined and uneven development in Russia that Trotsky was working with was the fact that most of the country was peasant based agriculture, but at the same time the largest factories in the entire world were steel works in Petrograd. Because of this, the Russian bourgeoisie was doing mighty fine under feudalism, so while they had some complaints about their political rights they had no material incentive to support a revolution to fully establish capitalism. So the proletariat and the peasantry will instead be the revolutionary group that take a revolution straight to socialism, skipping the capitalist stage altogether. The “Permanent” part of PR comes from the proletariat and peasantry taking the initial revolution that overthrew feudalism in Russia and established the bourgeois Provisional Government, and pushing through to socialism. The success of that revolution is then dependent on other countries that have more widespread advanced capitalist production having their own revolutions to sustain socialism. So the internationalism Trotsky uses to later criticize the USSR does ties into the theory, but the main point is how to base your strategy as a revolutionary socialist organization in a largely pre-capitalist society. How TPR ties into how to organize in a pre-capitalist society can be summed up by saying that socialist orgs don’t limit themselves. A rigid interpretation of the Marxist analysis of history is that feudalism/pre-capitalist societies must transition to socialism through a period of capitalism building up the Means of Production. Don’t get me or Trotsky wrong, that rigid process was necessary for the first capitalist countries such as England, France, and Germany. But TPR means that we can skip that capitalist mode of production in other countries as long as the socialist revolution spreads. So if you are a comrade in a non-imperial country, push for full socialism! Don’t artificially limit yourselves to supporting capitalism because y’all don’t have fully sufficient Means of Production. Doing so can make the working class lose faith in your politics and throw water on a potential ignition of revolutionary activity. The TPR is compatible with most of Marxist and Leninist theory, but some socialist just see Trotsky’s name and make certain assumptions about both its significance and meaning. Trotsky criticized the USSR for not spreading the revolution. The revolution failed in Germany, forcing the USSR to bureaucratize. Blaming Stalin for this is great man theory and not Marxist. The bureaucratization is something everyone acknowledges. It was a survival mechanism for a society that was nominally socialist but didn’t have the industry. Stalin was forced to forcefully industrialize instead of relying on the MoP from more advanced countries, and that had a toll. How much blame for that toll you put on Stalin is not relevant for a non-tendency sub like this. ",a9iryy,self.socialism,,True

cultivated identity and the left,socialism,"I worry there is a cultivated identity formed around the popular figures of BreadTube- specificially with Contrapoints, Folding ideas, and Lindsay Ellis. What we see in the modern online left can sometimes be indistinguishable from a fandom. I see this to be an important problem, because the most popular content in the community is vague in its stance, (the only stance that is certain is that it is social progressive) thus allowing for complacency. People may feel that their 'politics quota' may be filled up by participating in a cultivated identity in the left, tweeting about m o u t h f e e l, for example, and they may not actually advocate for a new social system, or even have a new social system to advocate. Do not get me wrong, not all content has to have a specific ideology, but when the most popular lefty content is extremely vague, and there is a cultivated identity attached to it, it can divert us from making real change. I first got very worried about this when I saw a post on r/contrapoints that had pictures of the major lefty youtubers and some liberal politicians, and said 'who would rather be stuck on a desert island with?' This is completely identical to a fanbase post, and exibits people who like the non ideological side of left tube not being exposed to actual frameworks for social change and forming parasocial relationships with not only leftubers, but liberal politicians. Through the combination of cultivated identity and leftube on a large part neglecting to talk about any struggle besides social ones (im not a brocialist, i just care about class and state opression as well as other identity opressions), these people resort to thinking these liberal figureheads are the answer, and LIBERAL FIGUREHEADS ARE NOT THE ANSWER. We just need to be wary of this moving forward, gain more awareness about class and state opression, and not let our movement become recuperated into controlled opposition.",aahsdl,self.socialism,,True
A proposal to provide free healthcare and education to all without taxation. What do you think?,socialism,"Hi r/socialism , how are you doing? I have an idea i've been working on for over two years and am looking for feedback/people who want to press on and carry it forward. You can even steal these ideas if you want. All I ask is that you link back to the original paper. Here's the link:  We all have different economic views, but one thing we hold in common is our desire to make the world a better place. Most of us can see that there’s something seriously wrong with the way things are today- whether that’s rising unemployment, poverty or the looming pension crisis. Nominalism was created to be a solution to these, and many other problems. I know it’s a long read, but please- give these ideas a chance. I think you’ll be surprised. In short, Nominalism refers to an economic system centered around a new currency that works differently than the one we use today. Once implemented, Nominalism has the power to end poverty, unemployment and malnourishment worldwide without raising taxes on anyone- even the rich. We can easily afford to provide everyone with free healthcare and education while eliminating taxation and inflation. Sound too good to be true? I’m sure it does- but if you think so, please read the paper. The solution is simple and easy to understand. Once you’ve read it, please feel free to stop back and ask any questions or offer constructive criticism. Thank you for your time- The Nominalist",aaqh9a,self.socialism,,True

I’m struggling with capitalism and life,socialism,"I am just writing this off the top of my head but I’m really struggling with capitalism and my plot in life. I did everything correctly and my life continues to get worse professionally, with no real motive why. I have an undergraduate and graduate degree.

When I asked my boss why he said it was because he wanted to hire someone new, I was making too much money and he didn’t want to pay such high commissions to me at the end of the year. Now I’m making less than 35k a year (this change was recent) and I just got a job stocking shelves at night so I can make ends meet when the change kicks over on my day job on 1/1. I’m really down trodden about all of this, I feel depressed and personally insulted/degraded by what had happened and I don’t know what to do other then vent. I did my job.

How to socialize a military?,socialism,"I was thinking this over recently, and one of the biggest issues with militaries (not just the American military, but most, if not all, modern militaries) is that they fall into the same capitalist/proletariat relationship that many jobs do: the means of production (service) are owned by an elite few and the structure of the military is (at least to my knowledge) anti-democratic. I'm not saying a socialized military would fix all of the issues inherent to a military, but I was curious to see what R Socialism thought of how one could socialize a military and make it's membership more democratic: military referendums on wars/campaigns? giving the MOP (weapons, uniforms, rations etc...) to soldiers?

Over the last year or so, however, it has gone from postings about daily life for foreigners and benign news headlines to explicit political propaganda outright at war with the Communist Party and trying to foment anti-government anger and hysteria. For those not in the loop, the US and the West have pushed their anti-China propaganda into maximum overdrive because China is currently displacing the US as a sole power dictating global economic development. This is why you've been hearing so much fake news, from concentration camps to supposed crackdowns on Marxist students, all of which are designed to create anti-China sentiment on the international stage. I don't participate much in the comments, but when I do, anything remotely positive about the government or CPC is immediately downvoted. It's obvious most people who participate in the sub do not live in China and most have views that in China would be consider very fringe and extremist, including outright calling for the overthrow of the state and the dissolution of the government as a unitary entity, views which at this point are the status quo on /r/China. I'm posting this on mobile so I can't really link to case studies of specific incidents, but if you go to /r/China yourself (please no brigading) you can see immediately what I'm talking about. Any success for China is treated as an inconvenience to the prevailing narrative, any negative is upvoted to the top and discussed as another sign of immanent downfall of the CPC. Rants with profanity attacking the CPC are commonplace and always upvoted, while you will never EVER see anyone giving even the slightest praise to the CPC. If you want to see the front lines of a 21st century international propaganda war, go to /r/China. A completely astroturfed subreddit committed to defaming and discrediting an entire country. Also, this isn't to say that China is a perfect country deserving blanket praise for all things going on there, but it is an antagonistic force against the forces of US and Western imperialism and thus we should look at anti-China sentiments in capitalist media outlets with heavy scrutiny and objective Marxist analysis.",aab9j2,self.socialism,,True

I work in IT and I'm tired of being mistreated by small business owners...,socialism,"So earlier around Christmas I got the flu and missed a day of work.

Feeling a little guilty I tell him that between the reduced holiday hours and me being sick I couldn't get back to him that day and I apologize. Then he tells me to buy him the new printer (with my own money) and he'll pay me back 'after the new year'. I politely decline and begins to berate me about how bad I am at my job. I suggest a different type of printer that we have in stock and we talk for a little while about some things he'll need for his second small business. Then I ask him some questions about his specific deployment needs. He flips out and says 'how should I know?! I'm on vacation in Florida! Call my secretary at my office!' So I ask what his office number is and he interrupts me with: 'fucking google me!' At this point I'm getting upset and I tell him that I'll look it up myself and then I proceed to read back his order of products we had discussed (just to confirm) but he interrupted me again with: 'oh so now I have to repeat myself?! You have trouble remembering?' ffs --- At my current job in computer support, dealing with these types of customers is the norm. Hell, I've dealt with entitled small business owners like this my entire working life. But this particular customer really upsets me because up until now, I thought he was a really nice guy. As much as we hate corporations and the wide range of damage they cause, it's small business owners that have personally mistreated me the most. They're the most entitled, smug, elitist type of people I've ever met and I don't understand it. So can we start bashing small business owners more?

A handful of greedy bastards holds almost the entirety of the world's wealth while countless people starve, die of preventable diseases, and are killed in imperialist wars driven by profit every year. Socialist states or movements that get off the ground are immediately surrounded and suffocated by reactionaries and demonized by capitalist owned media while the atrocities of capitalism remain ignored. Add to that the left is so divided between different factions that its power to effect change is next to nothing, and compromise between anyone against the common enemy seems fucking impossible.

Below is my translation of the section I received, which is taken from the successes of  this year: - Mobilisations around the world convinced the Argentinian Football team to cancel their match against Israel in June. - 18 artists and bands, including Lana Del Rey, decided to cancel their show at the Meteor Festival in Israel. Shakira and Lorde also had their own concerts planned, which they cancelled as well.^1 - In September, more than a hundred international workers published a call to boycott the Eurovision contest 2019 that will take place in Tel Aviv. - November 19th, AirBnB decided to remove listings from Israelite colonies in the West Bank, in part thanks to the global campaign trending under #StolenHomes - In November, the Chilean government massively voted in favour of stopping the import of products from Israelite colonies. In Ireland, another initiative is in the process of being accepted. - Amnesty International firmly supported a call to embargo the shipping of weapons to Israel and condemned the USA and the EU for their agreements with said country, calling them responsible for 'supporting massive violations against Palestinians' - The Canadian Student Federation, which represents more than half a million students, voted in favour of a BDS movement in its yearly assembly this December. - 40 international Jewish organisations recognized that the BDS movement for Palestinians' rights proved its engagement towards 'fighting against anti-Semitism and all forms of racism and intolerance'. They condemned all attempts to shut down criticisms towards Israel's politics. The Eurovision show is certainly going to be boycotted even more by the time it happens. More than 130 national artists here have signed a petition stating they will not participate. Solidarity with my Palestinian comrades!

Not thirty minutes passes before I become engrossed in thought about the world and the future. I have a near-constant feeling of anxiety and depression.

Seemingly decent people get surprisingly hateful when I argue for the mildest of left wing change,socialism,"So as an American socialist living in a conservative area, I usually keep my views to myself. However sometimes I try to convince family members or people whom I consider decent to be open to things like universal healthcare + education, worker ownership of the MOP, union solidarity, market planning, antiwar, etc. but I never explicitly go into labels or socialist theory as I'd most likely be shouted down. I try to stick to basic, almost social Democrat sounding policies to open the door to more advanced socialist beliefs, but even in this I'm having little success. Even when trying to make the case for more worker solidarity, recognition of trans rights, and collaboration over competition, people who I assumed were calm and reasonable, get unusually angry, defensive, and insulting. I don't really try to change anyone's minds anymore now as I'm tired of being ridiculed and honestly I'm exhausted. I hear the worst, most disgusting, racist, and sexist talk at places like my job and it upsets me but they think today's society is 'too sensitive' if I try to defend anyone.

On Removing Posts And Comments,socialism,"Comrades, Mods strive to make r/socialism a safe space for socialists of all types and identities around the world. This goes for Marxist, MLs, MLMs, anarchists, libertarian socialists, and democratic socialists. We strive to make this an umbrella subreddit that welcomes all leftists. However, there are issues among the left that leaves this subreddit susceptible to disunity, fragmentation, and disruption. There are some legitimate disagreements that libertarian socialists, MLs, democratic socialists, etc. have that should be discussed among us. However, some comments/posts open the floodgates for liberals, reactionaries, and trolls. Although mods remove as many liberal/reactionary comments/posts as possible, those well-meaning leftists who provide solid counterpoints get drowned out by downvotes and PMs from unsavory users. For instance, a libertarian socialist stating: 'Stalin killed millions' turns into , which then turns into a large debate about basic historical events that socialists have already established as falsehoods. Again, discussions on how to interpret Stalin/Mao are fine, but reddit's forum structure opens the floodgates to mass infiltration to an audience that is hostile to socialism, which leads to mass vulnerabilities on our platforms. Despite anarchists/libertarians distrust in the state, but commitment to leftist philosophies, they get usurped by popular algorithms on reddit that allow liberals/reactionaries to downvote well-intentioned leftists that participate in the sub, that disagree with their takes on Stalin, Mao, USSR, etc. This may mean mods being more heavy handed in more popular threads (that make r/all for instance). Now are we saying all leftist must LOVE Stalin/Mao? Absolutely not. We understand those viewpoints that are absolutely disgusted with them, and still consider themselves leftists. But in order to properly provide a safe space for all socialists on this sub, we have to decipher which comments are helpful in having such discussions, and which aggravate the other side and attract mass infiltrations of liberal/reactionaries to comment/downvote well intentioned leftists in this sub. We ask all leftist on the subs who want to have legitimate discussions on this sub to carefully consider all of this. There are ways to express these disagreements without risking our safe space. For example: **INCORRECT** (Democratic Socialists): Antifa is a bunch of chaotic anarchists that does more harm than good for socialism. **CORRECT** (Democratic Socialists): Antifa may not have the organizational structures to promote lasting socialistic effects. Each statement expresses sentiment about another leftist philosophy, but under the incorrect statement, leaves the floodgates open to liberals/reactionaries to derail the conversations to attack basic tenants of socialism. Calls of 'purity tests', 'tankies', and other attempted insults have been flung against our comrades. We will no longer tolerate any users that attempt to demonize comrades for their stances. Although this is obvious, 'free speech', 'open discussion of contrary ideas besides socialism', and other variations of these arguments are not excuses to debate, or challenge basic tenants of socialism. Also, social democrats are not socialists (capitalism with a bunch of welfare programs/ 'reformed capitalism' continues to place the rich agenda over the masses). Again, this is a safe space for socialists. Please visit r/socialism_101, r/asksocialists, r/debatecommunism, or r/communism_101.

Marxism recognizes the authentic engine of History in the economic material necessities of the classes, in the context of a given production process and their social struggle. >It’s these circumstances which require the arrival and success of certain individuals.

Critique of the People's Republic of China.,socialism,"There are some issues that I think the Left needs to come to terms with, and it has to do with discussion on the nature of the People's Republic of China. Obviously, not everything that is said about the PRC is true. One should always make an effort to check the sources of any story about the PRC that comes out, and whether or not it is trustworthy. Bourgeois propaganda and bourgeois sources are especially insidious, because while they can and have lied in the past, they will also at times tell the truth (and muddy things even further). At the same time, if a source comes directly from the PRC's media itself, it also comes with its own inherent bias that needs to be interpreted. But I believe that if we are to have an honest discussion about the PRC, we need to come to terms with some simple issues. For one, I do not believe that it is productive or appropriate to automatically label any criticisms of the People's Republic of China as 'orientalist', as this automatically assumes racism on the part of the criticizer. China does have its own material conditions to consider, but the Chinese are human just like the rest of us. Any talk of 'Chinese values' is reactionary mysticism and should be ruthlessly criticized (as Mao Tse-Tung himself did during his lifetime). Second of all, we need to acknowledge that socialism is not built in a day, and that it is somewhat understandable that the PRC would introduce some degree of a market economy in order to upgrade the productive forces of their country. At the same time, as the NEP in the USSR demonstrated, this can and will inevitably give cause to corruption, even if the measure if temporarily deemed necessary. It is quite appropriate to critique the PRC for this corruption and seeming hypocrisy on the part of the corrupt actors. There are indeed other issues, such as their censorship policies and their foreign policy, but these can be discussed somewhere else. So can other issues. But we need to begin discussing them in a mature and honest manner. As the PRC's stature increases on the world stage, we owe them and the rest of the Left that much. Any thoughts would be appreciated.",ab49zr,self.socialism,,True

I am a Muslim and a Marxist - AMA,socialism,"I always scoffed at people doing AMAs without anyone asking them to, but I see a lot of push back on this subreddit when anyone mentions their religion and such, so I thought maybe talking about it and possibly answering some questions may be helpful. Obviously Karl Marx stated religion to be an opium of the masses and incompatible with scientific socialism as well as dialectical materialism, and so the majority of Marxists hold that belief. I'm not trying to debate or attempt to prove anyone wrong, I just thought it might be nice for some of you to see the views many of us Muslims (and even Christians and Jews) have. If you're curious about my background, I am 23M, Bosniak/Arab Mix, originally raised as a Roman Catholic, I live in the US. Socialism first appealed to me at a very young age due to my Catholic upbringing and stories told by my family of relatives fighting along side Tito's Partisans. My upbringing was a little strange. My normal at home life was pretty volatile due to an emotionally unstable and sometimes violent mother coupled with a very bad marriage, I spent most of my younger years living with grandma who was very poor, whereas my parents lived a usual lower-middle class lifestyle. I remember when I was about 5 and I learned about homeless people on the walk home from a NFL game, and crying because I thought they were all surely dying (turns out that is more true than not). Ultimately, I think it was those three points that turned me to Marxism. I don't claim to be the most knowledgable communist, and some may point that as to why I still call myself a Muslim - that's fine. But I will do my best to answer. Feel free to ask me whatever in regards to views, my religion, or just about anything else. Don't worry about offending me. ",a50fbm,self.socialism,,True

Withdrawal of troops from Syria: I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY IN WHICH I SIDED WITH FOX NEWS OVER THE REST OF THE CORPORATE MEDIA,socialism,"Fox is supporting Trump’s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. Actually, it shouldn’t be that surprising as it’s a reflection of the profundity of the fissures within the U.S. ruling class. I certainly do not agree with the way Fox frames the issue. But it is clearly evident that the anti-war movement and the left in general needs to take advantage of this moment to raise the key issues with regard to U.S. interventionism and to promote anti-war mobilizations. An opportunity like this for the anti-war movement has not presented itself in many years. We need to seize the moment. ",aaxpgu,self.socialism,,True

We want YOU to be a new mod for /r/socialism!,socialism,"That's right, comrades. It's that time of year again, where the growth of the sub and mod retirement requires bringing in a fresh crop of young, bright-eyed posters who want to see Socialism In One Subreddit. Interested? Read on to find out more: **What do we want in a mod?** - Socialists - Diversity of: Nationality, race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity. Like most of reddit, the sub trends towards white American dudes. A mod team that brings in other perspectives can help change that. Mods from colonized countries in particular are wanted. - All tendencies welcome! Our mod team currently consists of MLs, orthodox Marxists, anarchists, left coms, and more. We want all radical leftists to be represented here. Are you a liberal? Not interested! - History of participation on this or other leftist subreddits: You can't just come out of nowhere **How does the selection process work?** Post in this thread a brief description of your political views, examples of real life organizing (nothing personally revealing, just like 'I started a union' or 'I provide aid to refugees'), your time zone, and as much personal identity information (gender, race, nationality, religion, ethnicity, etc) *as you feel comfortable sharing*. We understand if you don't want to share this information for privacy or security reasons, of course. Users will vote up and down the best applications accordingly. After a few days to a week (depending on the rate and quality of applications) the mods will select from the list, factoring all of the above and user preference. These are not elections: reddit has no system for protecting a democracy from bad faith voters, and the subreddit is too large for us to manually verify votes through a poll or other posts. **What do mods do?** Mostly, wield your power to silence personal rivals and accrue wealth. Alternatively, you keep the subreddit focused on its purpose: being a community for socialists. Remove troll posts and comments, ban reactionaries, and encourage user engagement. It's pretty straightforward. Ok, that's all! Please comment your applications below :)",a2dpna,self.socialism,,True
"I am part of the Yellow Vests movement, AMA",socialism,"Hi everyone, I'm from France, and have been observing, as well as taken parts in the Yellow Vests protests of these past month. I was in Paris last week and assisted to the riots of December 8th, and was in the protests in Nice on November 17th, 24th, December 1st, and yesterday. I dont consider myself to be the most involved, some people have been spending most of their times camping outside for the last month, I've just demonstrated every Saturday. I've also been following the movements via the press and social media, since I think it is a historic turning point. First off, a few observations : • It's not about fuel prices. This is what started it, but the sentiment of injustice in the population is much deeper than just the price of gas. • Police repression is extremely violent. An old lady was killed by the police in Marseille, at least tow protestors lost their hand, and a few dozen an eye to the brutality of repression. • 'Violence' (as in property destruction) is getting more and more accepted as a legitimate political action, and the destruction I could saw in the Paris riots last week was politically motivated, targeted to symbolic targets, and encouraged by the crowd. • Institutions (Unions, political parties, local governments) are widely rejected by the Yellow vests, as they are considered to be a part of the problem via their inaction, and high perceived levels of corruption. • The yellow vests have so far strongly resisted injonction to provide representatives for negotiation. This has gone as far as self-proclaimed représentatives getting death threats. • The movement is politically diverse and confused. Right now, the more consensual demands are that of more money for the poorer, and more democracy via the instauration of a referendum regime, but is still very unfocused at the moment. These are a few of my observations about the movement so far. I'll be happy to answer any question you may have. As a bonus, and to give you an idea of how it is on the ground, here are some of the songs I heard the most played during the protests in Nice.  &#x200B; And finally, I was asked to provide my political alignement. I consider myself a libertarian anarchist, but the most important thing to my eyes is fighting capital, fascism and surviving the end of the world. Edit : gold!? Yooooyahh!
