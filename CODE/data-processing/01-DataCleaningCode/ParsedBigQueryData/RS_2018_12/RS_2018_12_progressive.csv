The similarities between this man and Trump are unbelievable,progressive,"I'm binge watching Leah Remini's show on Scientology. Earlier on, one guest described L. Ron Hubbard as a 'malignant narcissist,' something Trump has been called many times. More and more, I'm seeing similarities between LRH and Trump. Now I'm on the episode where they are talking about LRH himself, and this is what strikes me. * Constant, pathological lies about things that can be easily proven false * Authoritarian - considered himself a 'total dictator' * Cruelty towards others, especially children. * Told everyone he was the only one who had the knowledge to save them * Displayed no sense of empathy or sympathy. Taught that everything that happens to you is your own fault. * Mistreated his wives. Abandoned his first wife and two kids for his second wife, who he married without divorcing his first wife. He later completely denounced his second wife and their child, saying he never had a second wife. She divorced him on physical, mental and emotional cruelty. He abused his third wife and his 4 children were raised in the Scientology organization by other SeaOrg members, assigned to hard labor, and never went to school. * His oldest daughter with his third wife was his favorite, and she was doted on and went everywhere with her father. * He was a homophobe and bigot. Believed homosexuals should be taken away from society and institutionalized forever. I won't go on, but you get the point. He was a horrible person, who people still worship. I'll bet you that the MAGAs could be indoctrinated into Scientology very easily.",a6tv0e,self.progressive,,True

new rule: penalty for government shutdown,progressive,"**New rule: for every day that the federal government is shut down due to political dysfunction, every member of the Congress will be penalized 1% of the average of their previous three years of income while in federal government service, based on their IRS tax filings.** Note this means the penalty will be calculated using any *non-government salary* income as well, which includes proceeds from side businesses, family businesses or farms, stock sale proceeds, etc. It could add up to a lot of money, at 1% per day. No matter how wealthy they are, they all feel the bite equally badly. The wealthier they are, the more they pay. That's only fair. (If a member has not served in federal government at least three years, the penalty is based on the years they have served, or at a minimum based on their current federal government salary). So for a brand new member of Congress without other income, this would be a penalty of at least **$1,740 per day** that the government is shut down. This would create a strong incentive for our 'leaders' to avoid a government shutdown, because the pain would hit them very personally. They're our representatives: they need to be held accountable. What leverage to we have over them? Virtually none. So, pass a law that punishes them severely when, because they fail in their duties to our nation and its people, and throw the lives of literally hundreds of thousands of federal employees into chaos, they allow the government to shut down. If the government stays closed 100 or more days, their annual salary will be entirely eaten up by penalties.",a5ym7k,self.progressive,,True
