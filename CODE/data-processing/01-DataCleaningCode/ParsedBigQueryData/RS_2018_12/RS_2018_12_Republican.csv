"Called out PolitiFacts with primary sources, was dismissed and ignored",Republican,"I should preface by saying I'm posting this here because I don't know what other subreddit people wouldn't just downvote to oblivion. I'm pro-American, and as such, support Trump. I'm an SF resident and read the PolitiFacts article last night regarding a meme floating around showing a mansion, being used to critique Pelosi's anti-wall stance. Essentially saying 'Why do you live in a walled community if walls are immoral?'. Everyone here knows Pelosi lived in the only walled community in SF for many years. Its in their marketing, its in her books, and its part of SF lore for most. The place was even originally built for whites to keep minorities out. So I decided to comment that they were correct the specific SF mansion shown was not hers, but she did in fact live in a walled community right down the street and it was a bit extreme to label the meme with their most falsifying qualifier. I saw the article using semantics to narrate their claims unjustly, and gave them the benefit of the doubt at first. That was until I was dismissed. Would I choose arguing about Pelosi once living in a walled community as my hill to die on? Hell no. Its stupid and Americans should live where they choose, walls or not. I only share this so you guys can see as I did, there was ZERO research in this article, and the content of which becomes more and more based on nothing or hearsay, maybe because their sources were a facebook post and fly-by-night news website. This is supposed to be a bipartisan fact-checking site, and they dismiss me with 'my sources say'. Data talks. I didn't save a copy of the article last night, but if anyone has a way to access a cached version somehow, I'd be curious to see if they silently changed the article.

President Trump can't be indicted on collusion charges. Fruit of the poison tree argument.,Republican,"The dossier upon which the investigation into alleged Russian collusion by the Trump campaign is widely believed or known to be a fake paid for by the Clinton Foundation. Russia, since the early 1900's, has adopted a policy of maskirovka(masking), or Russian military deception. This includes camouflage, denial, and deception. 'Deceptive measures include concealment, imitation with decoys and dummies, manoeuvres intended to deceive, denial, and disinformation.' In other words, Russia is happy to take your money for any information you want as long as it isn't the truth. One wonders if our illustrious intelligence services know this? Comey? Mueller? Were they acting in good faith?  'Fruit of the poisonous tree is a legal metaphor in the United States used to describe evidence that is obtained illegally. The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the 'tree') of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the 'fruit') from it is tainted as well. ' In other words, all investigations and evidence that are result of the alleged, fraudulent dossier should be excluded from evidence in court. All convictions stemming from said evidence and investigations should be dismissed or overturned. This includes Trump himself and all the people around him that were investigated in connection to Russian collusion. ",a7fxlf,self.Republican,,True

Two weeks in a row I managed to trigger the leftists at /r/Maine,Republican,"Backstory: About a week ago I posted a video on /r/Maine about how Maine was the best state in the country because of its gun freedoms while still having the lowest rate of violent crime. In said video, I called those who believe in gun control “libtards.” This did not go over well. I made a second video apologizing for using divisive rhetoric in the first which went over even worse. The leftists mostly ignored the fundamental arguments of my videos and instead attacked me on my personal appearance, told me I’m a waste of time, called me a psychopath, and, I hate to admit it, but some of it got under my skin. I really just want to bring people together to protect my state from globalist agenda but the response I got was so negative that I feel pretty discouraged right now. I’m still going to keep fighting for what I believe in and pushing out content even if I continue to get called a loser by my own people. But it just feels bad to know that the people of Maine would so quickly reject libertarian values in favor of democratic-socialist ones.

Why The Wall Is A Good Idea,Republican,"**Preamble** Many people think the wall is inhumane or a waste. But the truth is it isn't a waste at all. 5B dollars is not much at all considering the effects that that money will go to. **The Effects** Illegal immigrants cost us 135B dollars a year according to the U.S taxpayers. We only get back about 19B dollars worth of taxes from them, money being wasted on people who either illegally crossed or overstayed. If we can get this wall up than we can cut the budget of immigration and put it into other things like homeless veterans or homeless citizens, America first. **Why It Should Be Built** Considering how our money is being wasted on aliens we need the wall for that reason too. Not all of it is people who crossed the border on foot but a good portion is. A lot of drugs are being smuggled into the U.S by crossing the border a year. Illegal immigrants are 2x more likely to commit crimes than a U.S citizen, another reason why we need the wall. **Other Solutions For Immigration** Abide by the law, don't overstay your visa. A lot of immigrants overstay visas and we end up paying their welfare and they give us little to nothing in return. We need to deport the ones who don't abide by the law and who overstay visas. If you want a opportunity in the U.S do it legally. But I do think that the process should be quicker so people should have a good opportunity here, but not illegally",a847uc,self.Republican,,True

What happened to good ol respect?,Republican,"What happened to respecting the president even if you don't agree with him?

But now, people in rallys are making death threats to Trump just because he's Republican. Remember how this slander makes you feel today so when you disagree with a president you say,' I disagree, but to each his own.' I was raised with Catholic values to love my enemy and my friend, and I ask you to do the same and to teach others to do the same. No matter what you believe.
