"Currently in yr11 (last year before college), need help in choosing between 2 courses",college,"Alright so like I said in the title, I've applied to 2 courses at my chosen college and want help to choose between the 2 (I'm British too). I'll explain and give context: My 2 chosen courses are A-level Computer Science, Maths, Further Maths and Physics OR a full-time 'Foundation qualification in Computer Science' (I changed the name to protect my location, but it's essentially that). My first choice is obvious what they are, and the second is a full-time course focusing entirely on computers and it covers everything in A-level CS and a lot more, especially more practical skills such as web development and programming. They're both worth the same amount of UCAS points (needed for getting into uni), but I want to figure out which one is really more 'valuable' to universities, if there is a difference. I love computers and want to study Computer Science at uni definitely, and currently my grades and all that are quite good (dunno what my GPA is, not really a thing in the UK) and I'll most likely qualify comfortably for these 2 courses. The A-levels do have higher entry requirements too. I've been to the college's open evening and plan to go to it's next one too to find out more, but my college 'interview' is next week, so I think making my decision at the interview would be better and more convenient. If you got anymore questions I'll answer as soon as I can. (Posted this on r/applyingtocollege too, but wanted some views on people already in college or around that age)",a4ozs6,self.college,,True

Occupational psychology questions,college,"Hi! So I'm graduating community college with an associates for transfer in psychology in May 2019. I applied to several UCs and state colleges for Fall 2019 but this last week I've decided that I'm going to become an occupational psychologist as opposed to clinical. My question is, should I start a business minor once I transfer? Or will a psychology degree than graduate degree in Occupational psychology be sufficient? Would it be worth it to take on the additional work for the business minor or should I only take courses in organizational psychology within my major? Or what about a minor in statistics? I just finished my required stats course and actually found I loved statistics. &#x200B; Keep in mind I am a single mother. I've lived on financial aid while completing my first two years at the community college. I plan to use financial aid to pay for most of tuition at a UC and take out loans for the remaining tuition as well as living expenses. The loans will cover the cost of family housing on campus and child care is on site. I will then defer my loans until after graduate school. &#x200B; With these variables in mind (debt, less time to study because of additional familial responsibilities, etc.) What would you suggest? If I should get the minor, should I meet with a counselor now and change my course plan for my last spring semester or worry about it once I transfer? &#x200B; Thanks in advance for the advice!! I'm a first generation college student so I appreciate any help navigating college life.",a4ebs7,self.college,,True

I think it's in my best interest to switch from this Uni to something else,college,"By something else I mean a community college first then to another university. I did like this school at first, im in my 3rd year right now and my feelings from when I started then to now are the same. Regret. I came to this uni after visiting schools around my state and decided that I wanted something that wasn't a huge university, yet still was considered a great school to go to. Soon as I started my first year however, my feelings changed and after my first year I was pretty much done. Talking with my parents as much as I could without letting them try to decide for me, I decided to stay. I was thinking 'You know maybe i'm just tripping' and to give them a second chance. I should've stuck with my gut. Second year came around and I had an even harder time but some how pulled the rabbit out my hat and passed with decent grades. I juggled a full time job and I also juggled family problems and depression. I started seeing a therapist not long before the semester began and even though the talks were help, I almost committed suicide and I didn't love myself anymore. Fast forward to this previous summer, I moved in with my aunt and uncle for awhile. My family was in the process of moving to a new state and I didn't want to be home. I needed to clear my head. Being with family, and still seeing my therapist helped me see that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. I dealt with a lot before starting college and during, still kind of am, and I'm not alone in this. Even though i'm still working on my emotions i'm happier with myself than I have been in a long time. I'm not happy with this school though. There's too much to list but the curriculum and grading scale (i don't understand how hard is it to make showing grades accurate) need changes. I've already talked to a teacher and did student surveys to express my concerns and gripes but I have made up my mind now that this fall semester is over. No more just getting by, that is not how life should be lived.",a5f7x7,self.college,,True

Should I remain at a college where I no longer take the college's specialization?,college,"In case the title isn't clear (It probably isn't, I am terrible at titling things.), I am a freshmen currently attending a Embry-Riddle, which specializes in Aerospace/Avaition) as an Aerospace Engineering major.

I realized that I hate Aerospace with a passion, so I decided to switch majors to something I realized I actually enjoy, Electrical Engineering. While the EE program here is good, it isn't a specialty and I can't help but feel like I'm wasting money attending a specialized college when I'm not in the specialized track. My options are: >A: Stick it out and graduate from here. >B: Stick it out until the end of sophomore year and try to transfer elsewhere. >C: Quit, throw away the first semester and attend a community college back home until I can transfer to a four year, preferably one of the TAG UCs.

Went from CC to a private school and feel like I do not belong,college,"So I went to a CC during high school and had a high gpa and over 40 credits as a early college type of deal. Took very easy intro courses and did not have to study too much. I got accepted into a private university in the area along with some public schools, so I took the private option and went here. I can study 10 times more than I did at a CC and get a much lower gpa. It's just disheartening and I this point with my end goal being grad school, I feel like I'm wasting my time. Everyone just seems way smarter(finishing up my 3rd semester), got a C in a major class after going to every SI and tutoring sessions and at this point I just wanna be done here. Some people don't even go to class and get As, like really?! I did not take any AP courses or the like or hard sciences in high school but I'm thinking of being a biology major and going to graduate schools in healthcare and that C was in a general biology course. Everything just comes so easy to some people here like oh this is simple or I learned this in some high level high school class and I came from a pretty bad public high school that did not teach much of anything. And I know I had lower test scores and stuff than most people here too, maybe I'm just too dumb to be here. I may have to retake the class, I'll see, I know some programs accept Cs so my advisor said to just keep going along with courses. I do have a scholarship that requires a 3.0 and am tempted to get out before things get worse. Failed my first physics test this semester too, so that's also been a struggle, thankfully the class is graded on a curve and I can manage a low A if this final goes well Monday.

Master's Recommendations,college,"X-post from r/software engineering I realize that this is a long shot, but here we go. I'll keep this short. I am interested in pursuing a master's degree in software engineering online. My father holds a MS in software engineering; his passion has rubbed off on me over the years. Although I have virtually no experience, I am obsessed with the little that I've learned and have developed an unquenchable thirst for knowledge in this space. There is only one problem: I don't have a degree in a related field. I graduated cum laude with a bachelor's in a non-technical field. I've been doing my homework and discovered a few online bridge programs. I am in the process of reaching out to those schools at the time of this posting. My question is, can any of you recommend a good school with an online bridge program or something similar? Better yet, have any of you successfully accomplished what I am setting out to do? Thanks for your time! It means more to me than you'll ever know. ",a7fw3y,self.college,,True

Not an american student asking how to recover from skipping classes,college,"So I study in Germany, and I skipped way to fucking many classes this semester due to an influx of depression, homesickness (new city no friends) and periods of insomnia causing me to oversleep once I fall asleep early in the morning. I still have whole of january to get at least into damage control mode and recover what I fucked up. I probably will fail one exam but I still want to give my best starting new year. So anyone who had a similiar situation how do you man up? because for some courses I lack the papers and I have a law course to partake where its impossible for me to work out 1,5 months of ocassional missed classes and I also lack the online key for the course for the papers.Its only a lecture with a considerable exam at the end. How do I get over my disgust of myself that I sunk that far and probably disappointed my parents( tho they do not know), and how do I man up and ask the prof for the online key and tell him I have missed 70% of his classes. Its obvious Im gonna need more than 6 semesters to finish my degree but how do I get into the reliable and efficent learning environment again. When I was in school it never was that bad, neither when I learned a trade prior to my studies. Thanks a lot people ",a7irx8,self.college,,True

I can’t keep focus, all I can think about is how fucking lit not having to study after break is going to be and I just want to start my break early. It doesn’t help that my school has finals later than most. Last final is tomorrow at 2. I just don’t want to study at all. I know I need to at least a little, but like the deadlines also motivate me so I’m sure I’ll be studying tomorrow morning. I just can’t get myself to study hard for these boring ass subjects like accounting. This is the least motivated I’ve felt all semester, and it’s the time when you’re supposed to be studying the hardest. What do I do to change my mentality? Maybe it’s because I’ve done really well in my classes and I just feel like I don’t even need to be perfect on the finals because it won’t affect me much. I’m also the kind of guy who isn’t going to kill himself over something small.

Advice for odd class schedules?,college,"So what I mean is that my college doesn't offer the class I need next quarter. Only in the spring. But if enough students need the class- 14 then they'll add it for winter. So far it's about 8 as far as I know. I've talked with my Dean of admissions about it and that's what they told me. I've only got 3 classes left for my transfer degree and that class is one of them. Financial aid won't cover classes I don't need for the degree so I'll have to take 2 in winter and 1 in spring significantly reducing my aid to pay for living expenses with. If I can't go full time next quarter or spring, should I look into work study then? To use the time I'll have if I'm not full time with 3 classes and to make extra money? Does financial aid work like that? Since they will be reducing my aid for doing less than 15 credits am I still able to get the full reward for work study? ",a2yo1f,self.college,,True

Honest advice on my next step in life (Education or work),college," Hey guys I'm currently stuck and don't really know how to move forward right now and would love some advice on what you guys think I should do. I graduated from a Canadian college with an Advanced diploma in Business Administration last year and struggled to find a decent job so i volunteered at non-profits for a little bit, fast forward 7-8 months my elderly father who lives back in Africa had a bad fall and I flew out to help him with his business and take care of him till he recovers which he has mostly done since I've been here for 3 months now. This has given me some time to think about whats next, and the way I see it I can either go back to school and upgrade to university or try to find work. The only problem is I'm already 23 and was in a very unhealthy lifestyle (smoking weed everyday and not studying/games) while i was completing my diploma, and finished with disgraceful 64% GPA and need a 70% GPA to get into the program i have my eyes on. I truly feel that if I had another chance I'd take it more seriously since I've quit all my bad habits and matured. If if do get accepted into the program (Business Management) I will be entering into the 3rd year and complete my degree in 2 years, so I'd be 25 when i graduate which I know is really late. Should I bother going back to college to retake a few classes to increase my gpa 6% and peruse a bachelor degree? or accept it for what it is and keep trying to find a job.",a6jl6n,self.college,,True

Why having the right professor matters,college,"I just wanted to share an email I got from my professor about my final grade in the class and some background on it. This class had a market simulation where it was a zero sum game where half of the class got a perfect score and half of the class got a 50%. My group got a 50% on the simulation itself, but we had to write a report about our experience with the game and do a presentation on it. Doing badly on the simulation really had a terrible impact on our grade. This is his email he sent in regards to our report on the simulation: Team: I just finished reading your final report and reviewing my notes from your in-class presentation. Let me start by saying that your grade for this combined report is 98%...just exceptional!!! Congratulations on your excellent effort. I know you were disappointed in your final standing in the Marketplace Simulation and I know you worked hard and together throughout the semester. I also know that you are a special group of individuals. I've told you a number of times, if I were a student in this cohort I would had persuaded, fought, begged, or bribed my way onto your team. I think you had the most fun while taking your group assignments seriously, and I think you learned the most from each other. Your report was so intelligently and professionally organized and executed. It was a wonderful demonstration of the overall level of business sophistication you've achieved. And when I read your section on Employee Devotion I smiled approvingly because it showed that your hearts and minds are very much in sync. Something that should make you especially proud, and should serve as a lesson to you going forward, is the way you converted your disappointments into the pursuit of excellence. Despite the scoring opportunities you may have missed out on previously during the semester, the time, talent, and effort you put into this report and your presentation was a very gritty way of you telling me how you see yourselves. Please know that I see you that way too. There is no doubt about the quality. Needless to say, it was a pleasure to be your professor this semester and to share the learning environment with you twice a week. Thank you for the experience. Warm regards, Professor BLANK This email turned my whole perspective around about my learning experience and what it means to be a student and I thought it might help someone else as well.",a52s88,self.college,,True

Second Degree/Transfer Application Question,college,"Hi everyone! I would like some opinions. So I am in the process of applying to Accelerated BSN programs, for folks who already have bachelors degrees in another field. My undergrad major was very vague, but I did pretty well. Part of the process of getting into accelerated programs is completing some science prerequisites. Most schools require a C in these classes. Some require a B. I have gotten a sort of soft yes from one school. The admissions counselor told me that they would give me an immediate decision once this semester’s grades were in. Here’s the problem. It was a really tough semester and I ended up getting a C in one of my required classes. It’s fine for the admission requirements (though it makes me less competitive), but it’s not ideal. The admissions counselor has asked that I email her my grades directly as soon as they post. When I email them, do I mention that it was a rough semester? Do I acknowledge that the grade I got is not something I’m happy with? Do I just ignore it and send the grades without comment? Would love to hear what you guys think! I’ve been out of college for almost 5 years so this sub has been super helpful for me!",a8498w,self.college,,True

Back on Track,college,"Hello, everyone. I just want to say that you all encourage me to follow my path. I don't post here much at all, but I still stalk the threads. Seeing what you all post shows me the unity we all have as we pursue our dreams. You all rock. To those from undergrad to grad school and back, you all are winners. It's been 3 long years since I was in college, but now I'm ready to take it by the horns again. I'm starting up Winter classes soon, so wish me luck. During this time, I'll probably pop up more often. Yes, I know it's a shorter timeframe, and even though it's been a long time, I'm ready to take on this challenge. What I have now that I didn't before is determination. Seeing what you all post made me realize that the mistakes I made could have been changed. The suggestions you guys make have validity to them, and now that I know better, I will do better. Nothing is impossible. Success is attainable. P.S. Looking through my Blackboard was my inspiration on posting this. I feel a mixture of things I haven't in a while just looking at the syllabus. I'll admit, I got that little jolt of fright thinking 'Will I even be able to do this?' I quickly pushed that aside and kept looking at my objectives, telling myself that I can do this.

Program change,college,"I am in the program of my dreams. Well... I thought I was. In highschool I applied to the Veterinarian Technician programs around Ontario, but was denied. It makes sense, vet tech is a competative program. I took a year off school to make money and tried again, only to be accepted into pre health sciences. I got an average of 80% and after my third application got accepted to vet tech in Sheridan College! It was going great until Ontario teachers went on a 5 week strike. It was horrible, the ones who do electives or one year programs thought they needed contracts to stay longer than their program? Idk it sucked. Anyway we get back from a 5 week strike, have one week to hand in any assignments we started before the strike and continued where we left off. Only the second week back we had ALL OUR MIDTERMS. For us that's Anatomy, parasitology, animal handling, intro to vet tech, pharmacy math, english, and an elective. With the first three having labs, we had 10 midterms in a week. I failed most of my classes, including the ones I needed to move on to next semester. But with my high marks in english, animal handling and my elective (as well as withdrawing from parasitology) I was still in good standing. I redid my math the following semester and did my semester 3&4 electives early, as I couldn't move on and vet tech classes only run in specific semesters. They ran a special summer course for 4 weeks for anatomy and parasitology. I failed parasitology but just barely passed antomy. But I did go into academic probation, meaning if my average dipped below a fail again I'd be suspended from attending classes for a year. TL:DR/ END - I'm in my second year of vet tech (after three years of trying), doing two first year classes, and not even enrolled in second semester. Me and my parents have dumped so much time and money I dont want them to be angry at me for failing/dropping out at this point ",a7bqvu,self.college,,True
Fork In The Road,college,"Hello, A season is currently approaching us, but this isn’t your normal fall or winter season where people get excited about the crisp, cool air or getting to wear scarves and over sized sweatshirts. This season strikes fear into people. It makes them realize if they have the potential to even amount to anything in life. It lets them see if all those nights of studying and going above and beyond were really worth it. The season that is approaching is ‘college season’. During this season majority of the juniors and seniors start to finalize where they want to go, while some are still fiddling their thumbs and day dreaming. That’s where I fit in, I’m constantly fiddling my thumbs. I’m currently a junior in high school whose stuck at the fork in the road. I know exact what I want to major in, but I just don’t know where to go. I’ve been contemplating on whether attending a HBCU (Historically Black College University) or a PWI (Predominantly White Institution). Honestly I could careless about the ‘party scene’ and the other various factors of considering colleges. I’m just focused on whether which ‘road’ would provide me with an excellent education and a compassionate school that really cares about their students’ success. I also want that ‘road’ to leave me with huge takeaways in life and certain experiences that could shape me in the long run. If you traveled down either ‘road’, what was your experience and do you think it actually shaped you into the person you are now? Also, include the college you attended.

"SmartPen Advice, please!!",college,"Hey everyone - &#x200B; I'm in the market for a SmartPen. I'm going to be heavily relying on this pen to do its job well so I want to make the best decision that I can. I need something that records good quality audio in big lecture rooms (*without* requiring my phone to be used/out during the lecture). I have been seeing PenCasts online where I would be able to tap a part of my notes and the lecture I recorded will jump to where it would have been during the time of my writing/drawing it. &#x200B; My search results are dominated by the LiveScribe Echo Pen. However, the reviews for the pen over the last two years on Amazon have gone from amazing to alarmingly (at least to me) poor. There are complaints that the pen commonly breaks within weeks to a few months, that software codes aren't working, and that some of the software is more difficult to find because LiveScribe parted ways with one of the companies who made formatting with it (formatting the notes to text I think?). &#x200B; I'm having difficulties either finding longer time users of the Echo or people who can confidently recommend me better alternatives that fit my needs. I would greatly appreciate some advice with finding a SmartPen before next semester starts. &#x200B; Thank you so much to anyone who took the time to read this. &#x200B; EDIT: I have a laptop with Windows 10 (and am considering a small ChromeBook for classes). I also use Evernote. I do not have an iPad/tablet. ",a6m0jl,self.college,,True

Rough Semester Advice,college,"So I’m currently a Junior and I literally had my worst semester in my life. I ended my sophomore year with a nice 3.38 gpa made the deans list and everything was up for me. Unfortunately, since I always want to over achieve I took too much on my plate this past semester. I took 15 credits, worked in my campus dining hall 14 hours a week, was required to fulfill 10 hours of community service and I pledged a sorority. Since I’m going crazy about this all I ended up having to drop down to 12 credits, quit my job, only complete 2 hours of community service, but I still survived my pledge program. This semester I was distracted by the wrong things mostly money and the extracurriculars of school. From this I’m expecting my grades to suffer and go from a 3.3 to a 3.1 or even a 2.9. Now I’m highly upset and it is not a serious drop but I am looking forward to applying to internships and fellowships within the next month for the summer and I’m nervous that this grade drop is going to hinder on my applications. I’m not upset that I won’t be able to do better next semester, I am just afraid that this one bad semester is going to impact my goals for the summer. Should I still apply to these internships anyways? Ive been contemplating on giving them the older gpa, they don’t ask for my transcripts. Also, is there any advice I can get on how to not letting a bad semester impact you or how to bounce back, stay organized and effective time management that works for you? ",a87p3n,self.college,,True

"Failed a course, might change major, what now?",college,Hello all. I just found this subreddit and was wondering if I could get advice. I was taking a required course for my undergraduate major and it went terribly. It was difficult and I have a baby at home so I wasn’t able to devote as much time to studying. I should’ve dropped it but I really thought I’d be able to manage and stupidly I didn’t realize you only have a certain time period you can drop a course by. I talked to my professor and they said there’s nothing they can do and all they can suggest is retaking it. I’m reconsidering this major because grad school is a must and it’s quite a competitive program. There’s other life stuff going on too so I might just be on a hiatus from school. This might be a dumb question but if I change my major will that failing grade still be bringing down my GPA? Does it get removed? Is there even a way to remove it aside from retaking the course?

Deciding between two schools I would like to transfer into.,college,"Hello all I’m kind of in a pickle here. I’m having trouble choosing between two schools. I want to go into Conservation Biology and I’m stuck deciding between Warren-Wilson an out of state school that would give me a lot of opportunities to get real field experience while in school or the University Of South Carolina the only realistic option close to me with decent program in Environmental Studies with what I’m assuming based on their website is a concentration in Conservation Biology also I’m in a serious relationship, my girlfriend is a teacher under contract with her school and we don’t think she would be able to move with me to go to school there at the time I would be transferring. I honestly don’t know enough about USC’s program (not for lack of trying to get info) to decide if I should just stay but Warren-Wilson has been very good with communication though a little laid back which I’m fine with but still it’s just weighing heavy on my mind because I don’t want to leave school and not have any job options.

Thoughts on what to do/how to get involved if I take a gap semester?,college,"I’m in my first semester as a sophomore rn (was at a cc for my first year, this is now my first semester at a uni) and the uni i attend is 4 hours away from home. I just wanted some input on whether or not a gap semester sounds like a good idea and how people stay busy during their time off. I have basically two weeks to make this decision and I’m kind of overwhelmed because I can’t tell if this is a last minute decision, but I feel like my only opportunity to take a gap year is the next semester (signed a lease on an apartment for next year). My mental health has never been great, but it’s dropped to new lows this semester in a way that prevents me from caring about my work at all which is effecting my academics. At the moment, i’m almost positive i’m going to fail one out of my three classes. Meanwhile i’m completely rethinking my major, but i’m not sure what i’d want to go into but i have some ideas (possibly arts/film-also worried about this because it’s risky); and if i change my major, i’ll most likely want to transfer schools because art in this school isn’t well supported. And on top of that, my social life is not so hot here so that doesn’t help much with mental health. These sound like good reasons to take a gap semester to me, but i also question whether or not i can just tough it out. I want to be productive if i do take a gap semester and i already have ideas of what i’d do like going on daily walks/runs, getting my permit, and hopefully see if I can receive therapy. From reading other posts here, i’d also consider taking a college course at my local cc just to keep me somewhat still in touch with school, I would like to get a job honestly or even an internship that’s related to what i might want to explore for a career. I was also previously planning to go on a vacation with a friend when the second semester ended, so i might still do that. Sorry, i don’t really know what i’m looking for here, but i guess i just wanted some input from others about this, either their experience taking a gap or any suggestions. ",a2ykit,self.college,,True

I cannot sit down even for 10 minutes and do simple memorization for the easiest fo classes.

She is very professional and won't risk her job, and she was kind enough to specially open her clinic for a couple hours to come in on a Saturday just to see me. She advised me to write my own medical note and send it to her, so she could review it then fax it to my college as part of my withdrawal application. I am confused on how to write this note so it will still be convincing to my university (UT Austin) and also profession. Of course my physician will review it, but i need some basic letter to get out without it sounding like it came from some kid.

Email from Fees department flagged as spam by University's external filter,college,"So my uni got this external company filtering all the internal emails going in and out of the system. I recently applied for a special consideration to get some of the credits reimbirsed due to my medical conditions. The Fees department somehow didn't feel like my medical statement was enough and requested additional documents. This email never went through as it was picked up by the filter that the uni admins and flagged as a spam. As I never got notified, my application never went through and it's now too late. I went to the customer service (my uni depts deal with even their students through customer service of sort) and they told me because I was late for the deadline provided in the email (i never received), nothing can be done now. Mind that all these emails back and forth with the uni's CS and only the one about my requested documents got flagged. I've set up and appointment with the Union and they said they're going to look into it (they're an independent body). But I'm not too hopeful.

I need to ask for advice about a horrible experience with a professor for an online business law class.,college,"I made this previous post about this professor. I contacted him the day before the post asking him for advice:  This professor has still not gotten back to me! This professor says he can't grade my assignments because the TurnItIn percentage is too high. So I try to get ahold of him to figure out what I can do in this situation, and to represent my position. Basically TurnItIn marked my topic headers as copied... It also marked my facts and definitions, CITED mind you, copied. All of the sections that are my original work and interpretation is not listed as copied. I told him this and asked for advice on what to do for these assignments and future assignments. He hasn't responded for TWO WEEKS! This is beyond unacceptable. You can't just accuse someone of plagiarism and make some comment of not being able to trust any of their assignments and then not respond to them for two weeks. Especially for an online class where I can't see the professor in person. The only way to contact him is through email. This is ridiculous and I don't even know what to do. My confidence on doing my assignments has been greatly harmed as I try to represent the facts of the case, and cite things correctly, but now I'm nervous he's going to continue not reading my assignments and just turning them away for the TurnItIn percentage. So my last assignment I tried something different. I took out my section headers and it literally reduced the percentage by like 15%. I also took out my citations and just made some personally defined legal definitions. That dropped the TurnItIn percentage. I guess I'll go through and take them out for my past assignments, but I really feel like this is an error through TurnItIn, and not mine. I find it ironic because on my first few assignments my section headers weren't marked as copied, but now they are. So I guess I'm 'copying' my previous work. I hope to never use this software again and never have an online only professor who won't even take the time to read my work. ",a2fsp2,self.college,,True

Looking for advice on summer internships,college,"Hi, I’m in my upper years of undergraduate studies at a small liberal arts university in Canada. I primarily study Religion and History. I’m interested in finding and applying for summer internship opportunities, but am honestly really confused about how and where to start my search. My department heads haven’t been able to provide me with much guidance so far, and the university is current working very understaffed and with a low budget when it comes to student services/resources/etc so no luck there either. I’m hoping to find something related to Medieval Studies, but I’m not too picky, so long as it gives me an opportunity to gain academic-related experience in something related to what I am already studying. I’ve done a bit of independent research online into internship opportunities, but it seems as though everything I find is only open to students already attending the specific university that the internship is being offered at. There are no internships at my small university, so when students do have internships it is almost always at another university. I haven’t had much luck in getting guidance from other students at my university that I know that have already had summer internships—primarily because they are in fields of study (STEM fields and or psychology) that have way more opportunities so it seems and thus they have no idea where to start when it comes to the humanities. If anyone could point me in a promising direction that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. [TL;DR] Struggling to find summer internship opportunities related to my field(s) of study.

I’m possibly moving to the Oceanside, CA area next summer to live with my (soon to be) husband who’s in the military. I want to be an Speech-Language Pathologist, and according to all the schools I’ve looked at, they do not require you to have a specific undergraduate degree, there are just about 4-5 prerequisites you must have taken, so if I have not taken them by the time I finish my bachelors, it’ll just make my Master’s program a little extra longer, which I’m okay with.

I also would like this school because it is Christian, and my mom and brother also attended there online and have loved it. But the main online programs I would be interested in are the ECE program and Elementary Edu. Neither of which lead to licensure to teach. I feel like I would enjoy these programs and learn a lot because I would love to work with children, it’s part of my goals in life. But are there any jobs available for people who only have the degree is these fields and not actually the licensure to teach? I don’t know what other major I would do if I didn’t do something like this. There aren’t many undergrad SLP programs online, and those that there are, are really expensive. Also, if I did do an undergrad program in one of the Edu. majors from Liberty, what else would I need to do to obtain licensure after I’ve already graduated? What steps would I need to take after already having the degree, but lacking licensure? If anymore info is needed please ask. *TD;DR* I want to be a Speech Language Pathologist, but need an online bachelors program in something other than SLP because they’re few and far between and very expensive. Are there any jobs available for non-licensed graduates of an early childhood education bachelors program? ... what steps would be needed to obtain licensure (besides a masters degree) after getting the bachelors degree?

Econ vs Business School- Should I transfer?,college," I am currently an econ major at Boston College and while I like the school in many ways, I am not thrilled with the academics. I always wanted to go to business school as it just seemed like the most practical and straight forward route to me. I know that econ is a good major with many good job prospects, but I just feel that I would stand out more if I had a degree from a business school rather than a liberal arts degree. &#x200B; I applied for a transfer and got into the business school at Umass Amherst and if I go I will most likely study either finance or accounting. Would I be better off doing econ at BC or business at Umass? My decision to transfer is purely academic and while I do like my friends at BC, I would be willing to leave if I thought it was what is best for me in the long run. And while it is not the deciding factor in my case, it is also worth noting that Umass is exponentially cheaper than BC. &#x200B; Also I am a sophomore and I would be transferring in the spring semester.

Leave my physics studies for something else,college,"Hi guys, I’m a French student in physics maths and I would like to leave this formation for something else. I already started to look for the option in France but I don’t know well the foreign educational systems so I would like to have information. To summarise quickly why I want to stop, it’s simply because I did a scientific preparatory classes during 2 years and I hated it. I joined the university in order to validate a degree but I don’t want to continue physics because I don’t find motivation to study it anymore. Besides I found other passions, I understood that I was not made to be a scientific person and I also see the lack of potential of physics in jobs. It’s surely interesting if you have done one of the best engineering school (which isn’t my case) or if you have a specific idea of the research domain you want to work on, but it’s not in the worker world. Therefore I would be really glad if someone can help me. I still love maths so everything related to it would be good and I also love a lot of stuff such as politics and anything related to it. I just want to have the most information as possible. My most important interrogation is about the possibility of not loosing the benefits of my years. I would like to get a job the sooner as possible so if I could find a way to not loose my years of studies it would be great. Edit : I just want to validate my year in order to get my bachelor (which isn’t quite easy because I don’t manage to work physics). At the end of the year, no matter the results, I’ll not pursue in my current university or my current domain, even if I need to restart at the beginning. Thus I just wanted to add that I’ll not get a master at the end of the year and that pursuing in physics isn’t an option.",a9g3gl,self.college,,True

What can I major in after getting my Communication / Social Behavioral Science associate,college,"Good evening everyone, I've never posted here so I hope I'm not doing anything wrong, I have no one to get guidance from at the moment because my questions are confusing I guess, But I just finished my associate degrees in communication and also social behavioral science. Would anyone be kind enough to explain to me my major options right now ? I don't want it to be communication because after going through my associate I figured its not what I wanted to do, they focus too much on personality and sexual orientations, it felt like I was studying to be a therapist, but what I wanted to get out of it is to focus on the business and marketing stand point, I figured if you need to sell something, you need to communicate it well to the public, and therefor I went into communication, but that wasn't the deal in the communication departments at college, but I was in too far in and had to finish it. So now, I don't want to have the credits that I obtained to go to waste, I want to accumulate everything possible that I have earned into the next major for my BA.. so what would be my best options? someone told me, Business HR could be one, which I thought it wasn't a bad idea since there's a lot of communication involved in it. &#x200B; I hope my questions make sense, and I hope I posted it in the right place, if not, I'm sorry. &#x200B; Thank you in advance for anyone that will provide any feedback, Ibrahim ",a2iwbu,self.college,,True

"Non-UK EU Resident here, wanting to study in UK, specifically Ireland, could use some help on how to finance.",college,"Hello, I am finishing my high school this June, and I'd like to go study in Ireland, specifically either Queens or Ulster University, as my friend also attends Queens this year. My grades overall last year were bad, as I wasn't really trying, but am planning on getting good grades this year (my actual lessons start in January, have a practical job course until then), and I do computer technology. I'm from Slovenia, our grades go from 1-5 which would be 5-A 4-B 3-C 2-D 1-EF, I think that's how english grades work anyways. So first question would be, will I be able to apply this year with this year's grades, or will I have to use last year's grades which are bad? Second and main thing is financing, I asked my friend who lives in Ireland, he pointed me to UCAS which is pretty helpful, so I can get a loan to pay for my yearly tuition fees, which is fine, but I just now found out that I'm not elegible for maintenance as I'm not a UK resident, my family is not doing well off and it would be very unlikely for my parents to pay for my living costs. I am planning on working, but I'm probably not gonna get a job instantly, so I'll still have to pay maintenance and stuff, and who knows how long the job would last/pay. Now my friend said we can split living costs as roommates, which would be 300-400 per month, it might seem not much to people, but seeing as my country's minimal wage is 4 euro per hour, that's alot of money. So does anyone have any ideas on how I could get my living costs financed? tl:dr Need to know if there's a way to have my living costs financed while in university (apparently not elegible for maintenance money).

What should I do? (Greek Life),college,"Hi! I'm a student at a midwestern state school and I need advice for greek life. Here's my situation. Ever since I got here, I knew I wanted to rush SAE. I know a lot of people in the frat that could easily get me in, but it's not guaranteed. Our school offers fall and spring rush, and I knew I wanted to wait until the spring to rush, that way I could keep my grades up during the fall and start school off the right way. About a month ago, one of my buddies in my dorm told me about an off-campus frat called Phi Kappa Sigma (AKA Skulls) which was looking for people to create a winter pledge class. Pretty much my buddy pressured me into rushing with him, initially just so that he would have someone to rush with and wouldn't be so awkward/nervous. But, after attending their rush events for about a week, me and my buddy both got bids. At my school, Phi Kappa Sigma is relatively small (\~120) compared to SAE. Anyways, after I got my bid, I decided to stall a little bit and tell them that I had to do some convincing with my parents (which is partially true). My buddy signed immediately. Now, I'm feeling a ton of pressure from him and the other kids in the frat to sign my own bid. One of the ways I stalled was by telling them that my parents want me to get a job on-campus before I sign my bid, which is actually true. Today, the president of Skulls called me out of nowhere to let me know that he essentially got me a job at a really nice bar downtown, where I would make a ton of money with tips. So, the question is, should I wait to rush SAE (which could be a risky play considering I'm not guaranteed to get a bid from them) or should I accept this offer from Skulls? I feel bad being disloyal to them considering that they went out of their way to get me a good job. But at the same time, skulls is a little too small for my liking, at least here. Is there any way I could accept this bid and then rush SAE at the same time and, if I got a bid from them, drop out of my pledge class? Let me know.

GPA Transfer advice,college,"Hello r/college, I do need some advice as it pertains to transfer options regarding my GPA. This past fall semester I did well in my classes except for one class in which I was assigned a D. It was a chemistry course and was quite challenging. However, I will be retaking the class in the spring. I do believe I did not give this class as much effort as I could have, mixed in with poor time management. My GPA before was in the mid 3.8 range, now it's dropped to a 3.5 range. My school has a grade substitution policy in which it will take the highest grade of the two courses and as a result, my GPA will return the mid 3.8 range, if I am able to get A's in my other classes. Even if this happens I am concerned about my transfer options. I had Columbia GS, Rice University, UMich as some of my options. However, I'm unsure how they would view my fall semester D grade. Even if I am able to make a complete 360 in this class, I am worried that my chances in being admitted will take a significant hit. Should I proceed to apply to these schools next school year (2019-20) or would it be in my best interests to apply elsewhere, given my academic situation? For some background, I'm applying from a community college as a non-traditional student. I'm in my first year and will be graduating in spring 2020. My lowest grades I have received so far (aside from the D) is a B+ and B- in my language classes, and an A- in an Art History class.",a8se6h,self.college,,True

"I did extremely poorly in almost every class this semester, this isn't the first time. Mental Health Reasons. Need Help Planning Dropping Out (at least for a semester)?",college,"My GPA was a 2.96. I just received 2 F's, 1 B-, 1C+, and I haven't seen the last one but it's probably going to be a B-. I'm scared to even check what my GPA has become. I just finished my 5th semester of college, but it's only the 2nd one in my major (the class I got a B- in, economics). The beginning of the semester I had a messed up sleep schedule which messed me up a lot. I also struggled with concentration and no matter how many times I practiced a math or stat problem I could never seem to remember how to do it when the test came. I went to a psychiatrist last month and got ADHD meds, which helped me stay away during class and get back a consistent sleep schedule, but I still didn't understand a lot of what was going on and regardless of whether I understood or not, my memory stayed poor, I could almost never remember what I learned later. After 2 weeks on the meds, I lost all my motivation and drive to get anything productive done. Over time this has just gotten worse. Then when finals came around, I snapped from the pressure + lack of drive, I barely studied for any of them. I probably could have made my two B- a B+ and C+ into a B/B+ if I hadn't snapped. I went to my psychiatrist and he doubled my dosage of ADHD meds (which I was lowkey doing at that point anyway) and also prescribed me antidepressants, but clearly it's too late for them to fix anything. My parents are paying $19k a semester for my tuition, and $959 a month on my housing + groceries, and they haven't paid for next semester yet. I can't go home and look my father in the eye and show him my grades and ask him to pay that much for another semester, I feel like I'm wasting their money. I'm embarrassed and ashamed and incredibly guilty. I'm delaying coming home for christmas as long as I can. My lease has already been signed until July, so I figure I might as well stay in my apartment since I suppose we have to pay for it anyway. I don't want to be such a leech on my parents and such a disappointment and a failure. I want to get job or internship for the semester, but I don't know how when I have almost nothing on my resume. I've had one job in the past 5 years (summer job, office assistant at lawyer's office). I've stuck to only one club (Real Estate Club), I stopped going to others midway through the semester (Augmented Reality Club) and tried out for a frat for another semester, which took up all my extracurricular time. I want something that will advance my career (whatever i can do with an economics degree), if I got a minimum wage job that had nothing to do with what I was doing it would disappoint my parents even more and I question if it would even be enough to do anything more than pay my rent. I'm a generally smart and hard-working guy, I just have mental health issues and I don't do well in academic settings with little structure and where I'm essentially doing everything for myself, when I'm working for someone else I'm much more driven. I just don't know what to do right now. Everything seems so difficult, I don't really even have friends in college other than my roommates. I don't know how to fix my life right now, I just need a break to put myself back together, winter break will probably be enough but I don't know what do afterward. Do I lie on my resume? Where do I even apply? Who would take a undergrad college kid with a 2.5 gpa or whatever it's going to sink down to (probably lower)?

Should I repeat the class or pick another that fulfills the requirement?,college,"This semester I took a class that was taught solely by a brand new professor to the school who also was teaching for the very first time. She taught the only 2 sections of the class, and will teach the only 2 sections offered next semester. I haven't done well in the class for a combination of reasons. It was offered on odd days, MWF mornings only, whereas almost all of my major's classes are TTh only, so for almost everyone in the class it was our only class of the day, and only 50 minutes. The professor would read right off a powerpoint that was posted online, and never referenced the required textbook which was what we were tested on. And the only grades to make a real difference were the midterm and final. Additional grades only made a point or so difference, so if you didn't do well on one test you're screwed. There was no real point in going to class either for reasons said above. It also didn't help that I've had sleep and mental health problems all semester that made it quite difficult for me to wake up in the morning, no matter the time or how many hours I slept. Just an unfortunate combination of factors. When it came to test taking, everyone in the class expressed the issue that we never really knew what we were going to be tested on. And what did show up on the test were things we didn't touch on much. That and the professor would give us a broad range of around 8 chapters to focus on and change them a week or two before the test. I will very likely have to repeat the class, but I have the option of choosing between 2 other classes to fulfill the requirement instead. I'll have to get an override for any of them. It's just that one of the classes is said to be one of the hardest classes in the major, and is meant for students getting a BS (strong background in the sciences) while I'm getting a BA.

new room and roommate?,college,"So last year (freshman year) I had an awful roommate and I just suck with it the whole year bc I was friends with the people around me and the dorm was really nice. &#x200B; This semester I lived with someone new and we are good roommates, we both live in similar ways and haven't bumped heads at all this semester, but I applied for the mid year room change because all of my friends live about a ten minute walk from me, plus I'm much farther from campus than where my friends live. I didn't expect anything to be open but there were spots in one of the buildings, so I picked a room without a roommate. I was hoping that nobody would move in, but I Just checked now and someone has picked the same room as me. &#x200B; &#x200B; I don't really know how to feel about it. I have no problem with living with another person, I just really wanted a dingle and I really don't want another bad roommate experience, for obvious reasons. &#x200B; How long should I wait to reach out to her about room stuff though? Should I try to meet up with her over winter break or anything? I don't really know what the best approach to this is bc my first roommate didn't respond to me until a week before school started, and I met my second roommate during my freshman year so we'd discussed stuff prior to moving in. So yeah, I'm just bad at new roommate stuff and making female friends in general, all of my friends up here are guys. &#x200B; &#x200B; But yeah, also if anybody has any experience with a situation like this/something similar/anything at all remotely related, feel free to tell me about it bc anything (good or bad) is appreciated! &#x200B; Thanks!",a6ct21,self.college,,True

Scared I might be homeless?,college,I'm worried that I might get a huge balance like last semester and I won't be able to pay it off this time because I'm still paying off both of my credit cards that I used to pay the balance before. I work full time as a daycare teacher so I can't afford to move back to my family. And they're pretty toxic anyway. I don't want to be anywhere near them. About two years ago my aunt cussed me out for being depressed about moving back to her when I told her I had a hold and I can't re enroll unless it's paid off. I barely know anyone so I can't roommate with anyone. Plus one time I was roommates with a cowoker and her boyfriend asked me to have sex with me. That was the first and last time I want to deal with roommates. I will will also worry about my cat running away if my roommate opens the door. My roommate hurting the cat.

Just need to be relieved and proud right now,college,"Back around midterm season, I was shocked by a really bad grade on my genetics midterm. (about a C+, worth 40% of my grade. Ouch.) I was especially shocked because the class had been so easy thus far. It was just basic Mendelian genetics, so I thought I’d be fine. Turns out, I had forgotten several key concepts (including messing up incomplete and co- dominance, which cost me three points and is something I will NEVER DO AGAIN). The final was on entirely molecular genetics and I have never really done well with anything smaller than a cell. Chromosomes are stretching it. I’m an ecology student through and through. And guess what? The final is worth 60% of your total grade. This is when I started to freak out. I saw myself going down the path of no return: do poorly, feel so bad about doing poorly that I don’t go to class or pay attention because I can’t bear to do poorly again (slash can’t believe I can do well), do even worse on the final, fail the class, mess up next quarter’s enrollment because it’s a prereq... But this time, I didn’t go that way. I kept going to class even when it freaked me out to even show my face there. I kept doing homework even when I had no freaking clue what I was doing. I started to go to sections again even when it just made me exhausted and feel powerless. There was so much to know and I didn’t know if I could learn it in time. Finals week was approaching and I was starting to get more confident. I did every. Single. Practice. Test. Every single one. I made flashcards and studied them religiously. Wrote down maps of content on my whiteboard twice for each section. The final arrives: 4pm on a Tuesday. I walk in feeling nervous, yet somehow confident. I listen to Harry Potter music right before the test because that’s my number one calming mechanism and then it’s time to start. You know what the first question was? Something he told us not to worry about. I’d made a flashcard but never reviewed it because I didn’t think I’d need it. Getting over that minor road bump, I actually speed through the test in about a hour. And I actually felt great about it! I went over my answers at least four times, making my best guess on the first one, and turned it in at about 5:36. The instant I get out of that test, I find that flashcard and I GOT IT RIGHT!! I was practically skipping back to my dorm. Fast forward to today: I got a B+, which was quite literally the highest grade I could’ve possibly gotten. I had to have gotten an insanely high A on that test. I needed a 105% to get an 89% in the class. I have never been so proud of a B+. Well, that’s it! I really needed to share. Hope you’re all having a great break, even if you didn’t do as well as you wanted. There’s always next year! ",a7jk7m,self.college,,True

There was no numbered grading scale for the class which would tell us the corresponding number and letter grades. The entire class consisted of attendance, 1 presentation, and 2 papers. I showed up for nearly all classes, got a B+ on the presentation, an A on the midterm paper, and have no clue what I got on the final paper because this professor doesn't even have a gradebook section on Sakai.

I did everything right I went to tutoring, teachers office, and studied OFTEN. A’s and B’s in everything else. 2nd Year Spring: Switched to Exercise and Sports Science bc it’s easy and I had gotten in really good shape, so it seemed like a fit. During Christmas break, had a bad break up, deaths in the family, and inability to go home due to no transportation was stuck alone at my college apartment. Due to this I got severely depressed and didn’t go anywhere including class. Once I started going back to class I was so depressed that I wasn’t retaining any information. Friends got me better, started trying again. Kept pushing, but it was too late. Failed the semester all F’s. 3rd Current Year: Made a comeback. Got an A, B, and 2 C’s, partly due to attendance from working. Now I have no clue what to do with this major and don’t have the right prerequisites to switch to anything else yet.

Transferring back to old University...advantage?,college,"Soo basically I went to university right after highschool and I did good, but left because I didn't enjoy the commute and the sophmore year tuition was alot. So what I did was I left and went to my local CC for 2 years and now I have 60 college credit hours and was thinking, maybe I can go to my dream school. &#x200B; Now here's the problem: My grade weren't exactly the best after I finished CC and my GPA went down to 2.68. Now I have an Associates Degree, 60 college credit hours and a GPA so low it would be a waste of time applying to the school I really want to go to. &#x200B; Now my plan is to take a few more classes at CC to raise my GPA up a little and reapply to my first college (lower GPA requirement than my dream school). Do you think I have an advantage trying to get back in since I already went there and left on good terms (I left with a GPA higher than the GPA I currently have after spending 2 years at CC). &#x200B; Yes I know I fucked up but I'm only 20 and have an Associates Degree with no debt",a5r9o7,self.college,,True

My roommate doesn't understand a word,college,"I wanted to share this curious situation with you guys since I know the majority of people on this subreddit is from US. I study in an eastern European country. In my own country but completely on the other side of the country. Let's be more specific, I study in the Czech Republic in a city which is near to our neighbours, Slovakian republic. Some of you know that Slovakian language is very similar to our Czech language (we're not the same country though) and our education is better than slovakian so lot's of Slovaks study here. I am maybe like the only one Czech living in the dorms and met my roommate called Denis. Denis is a common citizen of south Slovakia, but history caused that there are lots of Hungarians in Slovakia and especially on the south since whole southern borders of Slovakia are with Hungaria. And these people living on the south of Slovakia act like it was Hungaria. They have their own villages where they speak Hungarian only, their own school where they speak Hungarian as well and this kind of shit Slovakians hate but that's how it is. So Denis is basically a Hungarian living in Slovakia which is quite shit because Hungarian language is that kind of language no one understands besides Hungarians. So when I first met him I started to talk to him but I immediately knew there is something wrong. So he told me in English that he's Hungarian and doesn't understand shit in here. I can't really tell why he is here and how does he manage to study in Czech language when he doesn't even speak the language of the country he lives in but he is studying IT so there is probably some universal language between them (apologies to all guys from IT, it's not my thing). I was really excited getting out of hometown to experience some college life and then this guy appears. Big introvert lying in bed only, doesn't talk, doesn't go anywhere or whatever and I hate studying in my room and everything. I can't stand being in my own room because I have no one to talk to and share anything that happened that day or something. I just come to my room, say 'hi' and that's it. Just wanted to say that because of this situation, my life feels somehow very empty. Whenever I want to say something to him, I just show him google translator saying words like 'seprű' and he just looks at me because he can't even speak English well.

Community College Student Loans,college,"I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to get student loans even though I’m in college. I currently have the BOG so tuition is essentially free for me. I need to move out of my parents home. 1. My father has NPD and being around him is too emotionally and mentally draining. 2. I don’t feel that safe anymore because he blames everything that goes bad in his life on my mother and I. He already threatens her life but doesn’t do the same to me. However I feel his hatred and he’s already talking about how I’m a burden in his life even though he doesn’t pay for any of my shit including rent. My mom works two jobs and pays for all the bills. 3. I currently have a 30hr/week job and do online classes full time so it’s definitely doable while saving 75% of my income towards moving out. 4. I was thinking of getting Federal loans as I can pay 80% of rent with my current job if I live with 2 other people. Private loans are harder bc my mother doesn’t approve of me getting them or moving out. 5. Despite that, they both fucked up their transcripts for my fafsa so I have to amend their taxes to get full financial aid. I’ve been too nervous and unsure to turn it in to the IRS. what if they reject it? The deadline is April 25th to get a student loan. 6. Now I’m thinking should I just not and continue to save up money and instead move out next year when I’ll start having lab classes that can’t be done online. 7. I’m currently so tired at home; I have no social life or hobbies anymore since my school is about 30minutes away. I picked it specifically bc I thought I’d be out by now and he wouldn’t have as much contact with me. Therefore it’s hard to even form friendships at school and I want to be more involved with the campus. I think I’m never going to be truly happy until I’m away from all the commotion and constant fighting and abuse. I’m just getting so tired.

Some tips for finals season.,college,"This is a stressful time of year for college students. Some need to maintain a grade for their scholarships. Others may need to maintain a C in a class particular to their major. Whatever your condition is put your body first. I am absolutely no genius, and was able to study for a total of 6 hours for all my finals. I see a lot of students making simple mistakes when preparing for finals. Your performance on exams is not related to the amount of hours you study, in fact it’s how you use those hours. I am not a huge advocate of group study sessions simply because of the distractions that other people provide. In order to use your hours correctly you need to eliminate as many distractions as possible. Put your phone away, change your desktop background to a solid color, etc. It may sound silly, but it will get you to the deep focus zone quickly. When studying this way study HARD. Do not just mindlessly read over your notes and expect to remember things. Give yourself practice tests by only looking at the terms and writing the answer on a sheet of paper. Do this for an hour tops and take a break. Go for a walk, do some laundry, play a video game, just do something. Take a break as long as you need to. When you get in the car to go somewhere, or you are doing your chores go over the material in your head and answer the questions, I promise this is where the quality repetitions come in. Finally, get some sleep and treat your body well. The worse you treat your body the worse you will do. Break away from the caffeine, it’s not going to help you. Do not stress about the worst conditions that could happen if you do poorly. I promise that life has a way of working its kinks out. For every bad situation I have been in, something even better comes out of it. Good Luck!",a5ihp1,self.college,,True

I was curious about how my last semester grades would be processed and transferred over to the 4 year school if the application deadline is prior to me finishing the final semester’s classes. Do you send over your final transcript after admittance? Does it matter if you will be obtaining our associates? I will have around 60 credits and want to make sure that my credits for these classes transfer over. ,aapwe2,self.college,,True
Should I take a business class?,college,"I’m actually studying criminal justice in college. Got all A’s and one B in the fall term of this school year.

I have no interest in stress management whatsoever, and while forensic psych sounds interesting, I’m already taking another psych course. I am somewhat interested in the intro to business class mainly because there is a small chance I might want to try and start a business someday, and I’ve read some articles where it could help you with other aspects of life as well.

How do you strike balance between being competitive and being a helpful friend?,college,"In high school, I had this really strict teacher who would get really mad and lecture us about how counterproductive helping out your peers is. She said that everything from opportunities, to class rank, to test scores is a competition; and that by helping others, you are only hurting yourself. Things such as taking notes for others who had music lessons, or collecting class work for absent peers who were sick were highly discouraged by my teacher. Later in high school, I had teachers who denounced this other teacher's way of thinking, which made me begin to rethink things. But it really got ingrained in me. But I also know that social circles in college are important. I overslept twice during my first semester in college and my friend sent me the lecture notes that I missed and I was so so appreciative. But also I found myself getting annoyed later in the semester when she would be on her phone during lecture, then proceed to copy my notes. But I can't tell if I am justifiably upset from the way I was conditioned in high school or if I should just relax and realize that college isn't a dog eat dog, survival of the fittest style world here. Because I do enjoy helping others and want to return favors, but it gives me anxiety to think I could be making myself academically disadvantageous. I feel so conflicted because I do still feel like I am doing great competitively; I just submitted my first abstract to a national conference, I'm getting involved in faculty research next semester, and I was the only freshmen selected to do mission work. But today, I took my first final and felt I did amazing, only to look online and find that apparently everyone else must have done so too because the bell curve caused me to get a worse grade than what I expected.

This is going to sound ridiculous, but I've been in a bad mood all day after checking my grades this morning and noticing I got a B+ in one of my classes. I think part of it is I haven't had anything less than an A since starting community college 2 years ago, but more importantly there's also this aspect of me wanting to prove to myself that I can compete with the best at a more serious school. As a result, I worked very hard this semester and was convinced I had at least an A- locked down (always scored at least 1 standard deviation above the average for the final and all but 1 exam). Again, I know this sounds ridiculous and I'm sure most people would be more than happy with a B+ in a difficult class, but I'm having a lot of trouble coming to terms with this.

Even when the professors are helpful, disciplines are usually very vast in content and to learn them well in the time given is just impossible. For context, to get this level of knowledge I consider well I had to read 30 or so books per discipline per semester and mostly alone. As result, unless we purposefully flunk at all disciplines to focus and truly learn just one, we'll only learn a thing here and there while mostly memorizing for passing exams.

Mid-semester vacation,college,"I'm a current junior at Loyola. This upcoming spring semester, my family planned a vacation for a random week in the middle of February. I wasn't going to turn down a free vacation, so when enrolling in classes I emailed all the professors to make sure this would be okay. I basically told them when I was going to be gone and asked if missing a random week would tank my grade to the point where I shouldn't take their class (I did this because I've known some professors to have really strict attendance policies, or strict penalties for missing an exam, including no make ups). Fortunately, all 5 were 100% okay with me taking the week 'off'.

I tend to be a wallflower type, so normally I don't talk one on one with my professors unless it's absolutely necessary. I prefer email.

It's a small class of about 20 people and we just mesh together so well and the professor is just amazing. There's a week and half left of school and I'm starting to feel really sad.

Random Electives or Double Minor?,college,"Hello everybody! My degree requires one minor, along with eight or so slots of general elective credits.

Very mediocre first semester grades. How hard is it going to be for me to recover/is it possible?,college,"Hi I go to a really rigorous top tier liberal arts school. I’m just about finished with my first semester. I didn’t get my grades back yet, but I am expecting a C in chemistry, B- in atmospheric science, A- or B+ in my paleontology elective, and an A- in my music theory class. Almost everyone I know here went to either a private prep school for high school, or a really good public high school. I went to a below-average public high school. I took AP classes and stuff, but the standards were so low that I barely had to do work to get pretty much straight a’s and graduate in the top 10 of my class. And get into several prestigious colleges. Then I got to college. Not having to work hard for years, combined with emotional problems and a really hard time adjusting to being away from home kind of killed me this semester.

What I like about this major is that I could get a job in communications or marketing. I would learn a lot about social media and I’ll take a few coding classes.

My classmates have texted me about how happy they are with answering a lot of the questions correctly, and I feel like I'm just left here without knowing whether I've passed or not.

Should I change my major or finish up my degree?,college,"I had to leave University in 2014 due to a medical diagnosis. I was going for a Global and International Studies Major with a focus in Religion/Japanese. The religion focus only happened due to class availability.

My doctors have given me the OK to go back to school and I’m really thinking about changing my major. I don’t have the passion I once did for Japanese, nor can I see myself doing any of the potential job outcomes (politician, teacher, government worker, researcher, etc) that my major lists on the website.

Tuition Debt and Finishing College Help,college,"Greetings Everyone, This is a good life example and a cautionary tale for those of you in my situation. I was not a very smart decision making kid when I was 17. I wanted to go to college but my mother objected to it, she thought I wouldnt amount to anything and was better off working (I come from an immigrant family). I started applications to universities but ultimately applied to one State Uni that sponsored my HS. I wanted to get away from home and be independent. I took on 5 AP courses by the end of my HS career. I had a 94.8 gpa with honors and AP courses by junior yr and 88 GPA by senior year. Overall I decided to be independent and prove I could do it. I got a 95% full ride to college. Tuition was 50k a year. As soon as I got in college I treated it like HS. I did the average required amount of work. I partied. I crammed before exams. I basically got by barely. First time I had trouble catching up by the end, I got hit early on with the fact that in college you have to more or less teach yourself. I barely studied and thus the final exams caught up to me. I withdrew from my major : Engineering. Transferred to Computer Science: Repeat same as before except this time I had family problems. Parents going through a near divorce. I fell into depression, anxiety, I began to get under the influence to cope with everything. Repeat as before. I transferred to Neuroscience. Same as before but this time early in the year I thought my FAFSA had gone through. Get to find out I was missing some paperwork. Continue with Studies even though my college bill hasnt been paid. Continued the school year. Things got worse. I became more and more frustrated with courses. I was already at my junior year. I realized I chose majors based on what would 'pay' more and etc but I couldnt figure out what I wanted to achieve with my degree. I finally withdrew from some courses. Failed to meet the 12 minimum credits for the aemester. Get letter of suspension and letter of overdue bill. 14k in fed loans(havent defaulted and I am paying off). Got back home. Feeling like utter trash. Disappointed in my self. I sent an appeal letter to the dean and honestly reading it years later on, it was incoherent and completely missed the honest part where I basically didnt admit to my own wrong doings. It was denied and rightfully so. Have been avoiding tuition debt (not federal loans) collections for years and finally, I found inspiration from my younger brother. He is hard working, before college he borrowed my old Java text book and self taught programming. Attends meet ups and reaches out to clubs. Always networking and doing internships. He did everything I completely neglected. He has come out of the system debt free and with actual savings. Was able to pay off his own Mac Book pro on his own, honestly I'm proud. At his age I couldnt even buy myself a pc. But in this situation I have realized that in the end dont take on a degree, because you think it just pays well. There is a lot that you have to put your part in. Networking, effort, internships and a goal. Following in his steps I have started teaching myself coding again. I want to finish my degree, but my first barrier is my tuition debt. While I havent defaulted on my fed loans. I cant continue college without my transcripts, I make 19 an hour and even that isnt enough in the long term. I somehow found a job in corporate but it isnt what I want to keep doing in life. I have reached out to my old college to see what can be done. There is no other way around the withholding of transcripts. This time I would rather attend a CC and climb back to a 4 yr college but that lack of transcripts will hold me back. Technically i can do 12 credits in a cc and return to my old college but im still in debt 27k + 5k from collection feed*. Overall learn from my life. What matters might not be your degree (some could beg to differ) but what matters is your outlook, your effort, preparation, and being active in a community, networking, making friends who might help you start your career. Overall I'm in this struggle now, I gave up at one point but the fire has been reignited. Anything else I can do to help my situation?",a6xgsp,self.college,,True

It's not a badge of honor to not take care of yourself. It's not good that you're putting your overall health on the back burner for a few classes. Go to sleep. Eat regularly. Go work out. It's taken me until my senior year to realize this. If you really don't have the time to sleep, eat, + study, then you really have to work on time management (I work + have other obligations so I get it's hard to work around those things too). I'm not saying it's easy, but it is doable. I've just watched some of my friends keep this mentality that classes come before anything and everything even if it makes them miserable.

"Question about GPA and 'open', non-major electives [BS Physics - Texas State]",college,So I talked to my advisor and he said if I retook a few classes I made C's in it would raise my GPA. I was wondering if at the point when I have all required courses to graduate is there anything I can do to somehow 'omit' any grades from classes not needed for my BS physics? Like I made B's in several engineering courses when I was an EE major and even a C in a bio course. All of which are just 'open electives' on my transcript. Is there any way I or an advisor could make it where courses like that don't impact my GPA? I am asking both because I am trying to graduate magna cum laude and because I am trying to get into a somewhat competitive graduate program,a84kmi,self.college,,True

I want to apply to a startup but one of the board members is a professor who doesn't like me,college,"Hi. The essentials are in the title, but let me provide more background information. It may be a bit presumptuous to say the professor 'doesn't like me,' but again allow me to elaborate. &#x200B; I currently finished my 'practically last semester' (I have one more mandatory course I need to take but it's not a huge deal) and was wondering what to do. I was originally planning to prepare and apply for graduate school next season, but also wanted to get some work experience. There is a startup company that deals with cybersecurity in the context of blockchain technology, and they recently put up a notice that they're recruiting development interns. I was wanting to apply, but the problem is that one of the main members of the company is a professor who I don't have the best history with. In the fall semester of 2017, I took this professor's course. That semester in general was a semester I don't want to remember (personal illness, family issues, school work was overwhelming, etc.) For one of the assignments this particular professor gave, I made the mistake of basically submitting the code of a friend who took this professor's course the year before me. I was (not surprisingly) caught along with many other students, and we were given a 0 for the total homework scores. I wasn't even mad, just incredibly embarrassed and ashamed. In hindsight, it wasn't only unethical, but it was just plain stupid. If I recollect what I was thinking and feeling, I was basically a zombie towards the end of the semester and wasn't thinking properly. I retook that professor's course this semester, and aside from the occasional 'hello' we don't really interact. It's just uncomfortable and frankly embarrassing on my side. &#x200B; If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Would you apply anyway, or look for other opportunities? Thank you.",a9w2aj,self.college,,True

Transfer OUT of the USA?? or should just study abroad,college,"I hope I haven't just skipped over some super obvious google search.. I guess this is hypothetical-ish so it's alright. * I'm at a 4-year public uni in North Carolina, studying Meteorology (atmospheric sciences). I love the major, and I definitely don't want to switch. * Currently 38 credit hours (30/120 = sophomore). I've just finished my 'first' semester, but I had CC credits coming in. I have some time, and I don't want to graduate in 3 years (I'm too young lol). I have no worries about my GPA. * I live really close to school (>10min). I know my parents want me to have the whole 'college experience', but I think it's silly to pay 3k/sem. for housing. Plus campus food sucks (+2k/sem.), and I hate not being able to cook and clean for myself. An apartment costs even more, it would be nice though. I know we're going to eventually run out of college money, but I'd feel much more secure if it wasn't being wasted on housing, campus fees, and meal plans. * One of my top goals for college was/is to study abroad. There are plenty of programs offered here, mostly to Europe. I'm just not quite sure how the timing would work out, even though I'm far ahead planning-wise. * I like school, but I know I'm going to get sick of living in this town. One of my new friends asked me if I'm *really, actually* happy here, and my response was: 'well.... um...... shit.' I'm planning to get a job soon but just not sure when. * My original choice of school was (USA) University of Washington, but 20k+/sem. for tuition is insane. At this point, my parents have *no idea* why I'd have any reason to transfer within the USA. Outside, however... I'm also a New Zealand citizen. When I was first applying for schools, quite a few people asked me if I'd go to school there. I thought about it, but of course it never ended up happening. The cost for domestic NZ students is closer to the cost of community college in the US, as far as I can tell. Of course there's also housing and (international) transportation, but after you consider the cost of study abroad, and the money drain living on campus..... How the heck would credits transfer? For plain study abroad, how would course equivalencies work (like foreign languages)? Is it that different for full transfers?

My last semester: A Memoir,college,"Let me just start off by saying that I've never been the type of student to hate assignments nor to hate school. I liked school. It was a nice place for me to get away from everything and focus on academia rather than the unrealistic expectations of the world. As college has slowly come to an end for me, I no longer have had the motivation to submit my assignments (let alone do them). I have two assignments left that I have started but have not finished. One of the two is a considerable amount of points and the thought of me having to finish it makes me want to beat the ever living shit out of my laptop. I get heavy thinking about the idea of classes, like I can't breathe. The world gets a little fuzzier and I find myself scratching my legs until I am raw. Yes, I have anxiety.

It's like they're not experiencing college in full, like I am. True separation from family. Seeing home every weekend seems like cheating to me, but I also picked a far away college because I was really anxious to get out of the crumbling culture desert that is the rural midwest. Because many of my music classmates and in state classmates have an easy time seeing home, it feels easier to connect with other kids from far away, whom I know are also totally on their own.

We're three rounds in, I haven't yet landed a hit; *and yet* I can see 'em start to sweat. It my chance to hit back. I woke up this morning to a text telling me everything has gone wrong. My partner for my film group project isn't there to help another member in the recording studio, so someone else needs to get there. Well, I've got 4 and half hours of sleep under my belt, so it might as well be me. I shoot for 4 hours, with one member too sick to come and another dragging her feet every step of the way. But I ain't gonna let that stop me! I've got my directors hat on! In the end I'm super proud of all the shots I got. I know that I'll get the rest of the shots I need for the edit by shooting alone. That's fine, I'll make it work. Film studies is done, great. Break for lunch then onto literature. I write a 6 page short story by midnight, and I've got all of tomorrow to reread it. Awesome, now to write the 1 page essay on the story I just wrote. Awesome. Well, time for laundry at 1am then straight to bed, right? Wrong, fools! Who's that in my lounge but my friend from Lit class. I guess she's working on her project too, right? Ah, it appears she's not. Alas she under the impression that its not due until the 12th. Uh-uh, darling its due tomorrow, but never fear, KingFerdidad was drunk three classes of Cheerwine and is basically the Kwisatz Haderach now. So of course I punch up her essay for her and agree to work with her tomorrow. What's the moral of this story? Well, I'll be straight with you, being real tired doesn't exponentially increase my powers like Max Damage. So if I, craving sleep, sleep that knits up the ravaged sleeve of care, can write killer essays, just imagine what you could do if you got some real nice sleep. So, you, reading this write now, shut your laptop or phone down right now. Immediately. You're gonna wake up early, get a solid breakfast, and at 10:30 am you're gonna rock that essay or those flash cards with your lightning fast and revified brains.

Gift to a professor?,college,"Last winter, I had a professor who helped me immensely in so many ways. I wanted to give him something (small gift, thank you card..) as a sign of my gratitude, but I didn't want him to think of it as a bribe for improving my grade. I couldn't give anything to him after the end of the winter semester because I knew I had to take another course by him this summer. I couldn't give anything even after the summer course because he said he would be teaching in my post-graduate program, and I didn't know whether I would be taking another course with him. Taking a course with him means he would have control over my grade, and any form of gift/card would appear as a bribe. This semester, I'm not taking any course by him, so I can prepare a gift, but it seems so AWKWARD for me to suddenly give him a thank you card/gift related to what happened almost a year ago... but I'm worried if it would be rude of me to not give any thank you card/gift after all he has done to help me. I did verbally express (and in email) my thanks to him multiple times though. I do want to keep in touch with him. What should I do? Advice would be much appreciated. ",a37z9i,self.college,,True

I was banking that I do great on my final, I studied for a week and half but the test was just something I couldn't study for.

Unhappy at current uni - worth it to transfer?,college,"I'm a current freshman at my state university, which is an awesome university in a lot of ways and, more importantly, I have a completely full ride. I just finished my first semester, though, and am considering transferring, or at the very least applying around. Granted, it's only been a semester, but I haven't been happy here. The program for my interests isn't strong (they don't even offer the degree program I want to pursue), there isn't research that's relevant to my career goals and interests (which is kind of a dinger since I wanted to go to grad school and become a research scientist), and I've had a hard time fitting in and relating to my peers- I've found the culture of the school pretty offputting. It also hasn't been very challenging - less so than highschool. There's also the fact that it's so close to home. I'm going to college literally 20 minutes away from where I grew up. 80 out of 150 of my graduating class went to this college. Where I live is very, very homogeneous (98% white, and quite rural), and I've never left my home state. I feel like this semester I've just fallen into a rut, and all of my excitement and expectations about college being full of new experiences and challenges have been smashed. I just feel bored. I've always subscribed to the idea that it doesn't really matter where you go to school for undergrad, it is what you make it of it, etc. (especially given the cost), but am beginning to wonder if I wouldn't be happier someplace further from home, more diverse, and with a stronger program for my interests. Is it ridiculous of me to even consider passing up a full ride? I was thinking of applying to UMichigan - they have a fantastic Ecology Evolution program, an amazing zoology museum, and it would be a much-needed shock to my rural-New England-homebody system to go someplace more diverse. Also UC Santa Cruz. I don't know, I just don't feel like I can grow here, and that's what college is supposed to be all about (or maybe it's just the marketing getting to me). &#x200B; \*I should note that my family is not really able to contribute much. My dad is not financially involved and my mom makes $30K a year.

Grad school chances with poor undergrad grades?,college,"So, here’s the story. I was a psychology major in undergrad. My ultimate goal was to become a licensed clinical social worker.

Exam date conflicting with work schedule.,college,"So I'm taking American Sign Language this semester and the school decided to schedule our exam for a Saturday afternoon. Problem is I am working that Saturday afternoon during the hours the exam will be administered. My professor is deaf so I had to sign to him that I am working that day and cannot make it. He goes on to just write on the board 'I did not make the exam date, the school did' and continues on with class.

So after sending an email and waiting almost a week I have not heard back from my professor. I went ahead and emailed the advising center and was told to keep trying to work it out with my professor and if I cannot, to see about changing my work schedule.

Question regarding transferring credits from community college to university?,college,"Hi, I'm finishing up my associate's degree at a CC soon and plan on transferring to a university for my bachelor's. I've used the transferology website to see what courses can transfer over but I still can't find what I'm looking for. I plan on taking a few of my required bachelor's courses at my CC so I have less to take at the university but I'm not sure if a 100 level class will transfer over to a 200 level class at the other school For example, I'm taking Business 111 (Intro to business 100 level course) at my CC, transferology says it will transfer over but doesn't specify to what class it will replace at the university, but, at the university their intro to business class is a 200 level course. So, even though it says it will transfer over, I'm worried there's going to be complications since the course is 100 level at my CC and 200 level at the university I'm looking to transfer to.

Reflection of my very 1st semester at Uni,college,"As finals as over for me I wanted to kind of reflect on my first semester of college. Sorry if it’s gonna sound super sad or long I don’t expect you guys to give me any advice but I just wanted to share a little bit since I’ve been thinking a lot of things lately or throughout the entire time while I was away. Overall my first semester wasn’t what I expected it to be at the time I was applying for schools I didn’t really look into many factors such as fit, location and program I kinda just went to a school bc the thought of being away from my toxic family sounds pretty cool. After a few months into college I didn’t really like the campus. I didn’t fit and i would always look at my friends Snapchat stories seeing how they’re loving college and their school so far while I kind of sit there and reevaluate why I’m not enjoying the “college experience”. I mean I made some friends but I was friends with the wrong crowd, but I went along with it because I didn’t want to have the feeling of being lonely again. I also realized that the major I wanted to peruse (neuroscience) they don’t offer it here which sucks because like I said I didn’t really look into some factors. I finally decided to leave uni and go to community college for a year while trying to figure out what I really want to do and where I want to go but it’s just gonna suck being in my parents house for the next few months.

Does this professor sound frustrating or am I just being annoying,college,"This is for a math class by the way.

The first 4 quizzes I got two 5/5's, a 4/5 and then on the 4th I messed up and got a 1/5... so my grade for the middle of the semester was a C... Additionally on 2 of the quizzes I took recently I got a 3/5 and 2.5/5. When I went to her she said I was suppose to get 5/5's but I didn't show work. I then literally pointed to all my computing and formulas saying that is my work and she just goes 'No'... so I get -50 points off and -40 points off because she said I didn't show enough work when I clearly did... It doesn't help that these 1-2 question quizzes are usually based off of 3-4 sections.. so she forces her students to study multiple sections when the quiz is randomly based off of 1 section you won't know which ... a class should not be structured like this especially a MATH CLASS.....

"Missed an exam due to ongoing illness, has MC, what to do next?",college,"Using a throwaway account in case people find out I use Reddit. Few in my college know I use Reddit and few use Reddit but I'll still use this throwaway for emergencies just in case. So what happened was that I fell ill during my exam season, was studying through the night and then slept through my final. I only realized it when I woke up late that morning. I usually play tough and don't take MC's even though I am ill, so people don't know I'm ill. I was horrified and rushed to the university despite my tension to see what to do next. I was told to quickly go to the doctor and get my condition treated, before getting the necessary paperwork. I visited the clinic, got diagnosed with severe tension headache, prescribed with some medication and handed an MC, which I promptly handed over to the clerk together with the necessary paperwork filled out. I was also told to take a break over this examination and focus on the next subject. The problem here is that I'm on scholarship. This particular exam is 70% of my score and the passing mark is 40%. Thus if my appeal fails, I fail and have to retake the subject with my percentage grade capped at 40%. Failing a subject also automatically removes the scholarship award from me. I am fully aware of how bad a failing grade looks on a transcript during initial job interviews and internships. Told another confidant about my issue and asked what to do, and i was told to wait for due process. Due process takes place only after the final exam cycle, and the meeting is two weeks from now, a private meeting between the exam and faculty board to determine which exam absentees get to sit for a makeup exam. I am fully aware of the consequences of having to sit for a makeup exam as well, the questions are usually harder and scripts are much more scrutinized. What are my chances of being allowed to resit this examination and get the grade I should have got if I sat for the original examination? Tldr: I missed an exam due to illness, supplied MC and paperwork to university after advice. What are my chances of being allowed to resit this examination? ",a41djk,self.college,,True

A tl;dr of the reasons why I am trying to move: my roommate lashes out at me when she's stressed, she has done things that make me feel unwelcome in my own room, she has kicked me and my boyfriend out and we had to sleep in common areas or with our other friends because she says she is claustrophobic, but she doesn't mind when its her boyfriend over and she has other guys sleepover in our dorm, she talks badly about my friends and boyfriend for very arbitrary reasons, and I feel that she used me as a 'token minority friend' sometimes and asks me questions she could easily google and says 'subtly' anti semitic stuff about my boyfriend. After talking to friends and a counsellor about this, they all advised me to leave. I want to so bad, but when she does nice things for me, I get confused. She sees me as one of her closest friends here and I try to help her when I can. But the way she has treated me makes me uncomfortable living with her and that is not fair to me. For some background on her, she had good friends in the start of the year. She kind of didn't talk to me during this and said passive aggressive things to me during this time, but I didn't mind because she is entitled to her own friends and doesn't have an obligation to hang out with me. I made my own friends and branched out and got a pretty solid friend group. During this time her friends broke apart and ditched her and this had an effect on her. She still talks ill of them months later and doesn't really branch out anymore. She spends all day in the dorm. She tells me that I'll be the only social interaction she gets all day and talk to me for hours when I am trying to go to bed. She tells me that she depends on me and this makes me feel guilty for wanting to move.

Just as a possibility, nothing set in stone yet. &#x200B; Here's the problem: Finance doesn't have regular engineering calculus. They have special business calculus separate from the regular 4 series engineering calc. This doesn't please my brother or my father. They both have gone through Calc 1-3, and they both want me to do it. I said I would if I decided to stick with CS, but if I go with Finance I'm not going to do it because it's not part of the track and thus, a waste of time. They think I just don't want to do it because I'm being lazy, even though I registered myself in Calculus I next semester, and only said I were to switch out of it if I went the Finance route. &#x200B; They said if I go the Finance route i should STILL take Engineering calculus because they have and they think it's critical that I learn those skills as they'll be needed anywhere I go.

I did a personality test to discover what I'd be good at, but I'm turned off by most of the careers because they aren't very good financially. Also, counselors aren't very useful. I want a job that gets me good money and interests me enough to learn about it. But I fear that second part doesn't exist. I tried to think about what I like and I realize I really don't like anything in particular. Is there hope for me? Study tips? Career ideas? Help me please.",a1ywkx,self.college,,True

Is anyone else worried about what they’re majoring in?,college,"Hey guys, new to reddit, have been an avid reader for a while but felt the want to join to gain some perspective. My person is that of a hybrid between paranoia and anxiety, because I was never one of those kids that knew what they wanted to do for a career (i am aware that this is normal). I spent a majority of my life inside my house because my parents were overprotective and never let me socialize, I was isolated and spent a majority of my life alone. Never got to experience life in the sense where I should have tried different things and now I’m stuck in a psychological prison. I did OK in high school...didn’t shine but didn’t fail...average, I went to college and dropped out of liberal arts because I had no interest in philosophy and wanted to work, which is what I did for 5 years. My resume is full of customer service and sales..but quite recently took up a job doing tree-work for the local utility company. I have come to the understanding that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life and went back to go to school for business. I’m just doing it so that I can land a better job and not end up on the street, but I’m constantly worried that business is useless because it is not stem or that white collar professions are eventually going to become automated. If that’s the case I always have my utility trade to fall back on, but I work with guys who remind me that this is not where I want to be. My only hobby in life was playing video games when I was alone and people keep telling me to go for computer science but the math turns me off...but I realized I have to grow a pair and deal with it. Either or I’m still stuck in the “fuck I have no idea what to do with college or my life” and I’m constantly looking up career changes. Any advice will help.",a4r4m8,self.college,,True

I know leaving home is something I'm going to have to deal with eventually; however, with mental health issues I've had in the past I'm afraid of stressing myself out too much by constantly being around people. What I've been considering doing instead is going to a nearby commuter school and transferring to the larger school after a year to ease myself into the idea of college.

So I want to plan accordingly. There’s no reason for me to take classes right now that won’t transfer, so how the fuck do I figure out which classes *to* take?

How to handle abusive behavior by college staff.,college,"My wife is currently attending the Dental Hygiene program at a community college in NC. Over the course of the program there have been multiple instances of what I would consider abusive behavior by the staff directed at students. The problem is now progressing to the point that my wife is considering dropping out because she feels threatened while at school, and her mental health is severely affected. A few examples (not all conclusive): * The clinical portion of the program is structured such that students require an instructors signature in order to complete a patient. Instructors are frequently unavailable for the signature or will be delayed while engaging in personal conversations after they've been notified of the pending completion, and will then dock points or fail the student for finishing after the clinic time window. * Teachers raising their voices at students and persisting until students leave the room crying (this has happened on multiple occasions). * Program director changing the absence policy mid semester because 'students were taking advantage of her'. New policy is zero tolerance and students will receive zeros for the day, as well as additional zeros as punishment. This applies to students who have had planned absences for over a year, or who have had to attend funerals. (School policy is to allow 4 excused absences). * When confronted about the above by the class, director states 'Why are you attacking me', 'Go ahead, get MY dean, I'll show you he is on MY side', 'See if you try to take advantage of me again next semester, I'll make sure you don't see the light of day.' * The students are also responsible for fundraising money to help cover the cost of the board exams and exam review for the entire class. The instructors are in charge of how this money is spent. They used the money that my wife's class raised the first year to pay for the graduating class. The expectation is that this pattern is to continue. But now they've decided to use the funds from my wifes class to also fund hotel rooms at a conference for the rising class, essentially screwing them out of the money they've raised twice. We are hesitant to reach out to the dean because of the 'My Dean' comments, and because the director has the ability to change the clinic requirements any time and may create an even more difficult environment. However I do not know where else to turn. Are there any options for the students in this situation? Should the staff not be held responsible for my Wife's mental state, and financially responsible for tuition if they are essentially manipulating grades? ",a3u69e,self.college,,True

If you have to take longer to re-mediate yourself but it means you graduate instead of flunking out (like I almost did) then by all means take an extra semester or year. Also, socializing. You're just as nervous as every other person is at the start of college. Go out and talk to people. Get out of your dorm room and take a break from studying once in a while.

Psycho sorority sister,college,"So basically to sum up this story, I have this sorority sister. When i came to this college sophomore year, I was in the same major as her and then I joined the sorority. So we had some classes here and there, I was nice but never got too close bc I got a mean vibe from her (talking wild smack about people) I don’t really know where this part began, but at some point she just started hating me and making up rumors about me, starting with that my boyfriend at the time cheated on me (wasn’t true). Fast forward to now, where I supposedly am “experimenting with my roommates” meaning I’m gay, I have an std that i “have to take pills to fix everyday”, and more. Usually I get angry at first because she starts these cray things out of nowhere, but I end up laughing about it because it’s so crazy. However, this is starting to become ridiculous because people are believing it and talking about it. I want to confront her because I’m so tired of this. The best way I can describe her is a pathological liar, and lots of people know this about her. I think she has probably said much more about me than I know, as well as other people, so I think it’s time to put an end to it and confront her in person.

Failed two classes. Feeling very lost about my major/career/future,college,"Not sure if this is the right place to post but here we go: I am a third year computer engineering major who just finished fall quarter. I just finished my last final two days ago so grades aren’t finalized yet but I’m 80% sure that I failed two of the three classes I took (computer architecture and computer networks). I’ve been feeling very disappointed and depressed because I did try. This is not usual for me. After my first two years, my cumulative GPA was around a 3.2 (mostly grades ranging between B- and A-). Never got a grade below C+. I took 17-18 units (4 classes) every quarter in those 2 years. I even had a part time job during my second year. Never partied—didn’t have much of a social life. Before the start of this school year, I decided to quit my job and take only 12 units (3 classes). Still no social life. I didn’t really do anything outside of academics other than a club meeting once a week and gym 3 times a week. So you’re probably thinking “What the hell happened?” To be honest, I’m not exactly sure. I always knew my time management skills were not good. (I’ve always felt like I only had time for schoolwork while my classmates can pull high grades, participate in extracurriculars and have a social life.) I’m slow at completing tasks. This quarter, I prioritized reading the textbook and taking copious notes before lecture and I feel this took chunks of my time. I couldn’t start homework early or start studying for an exam early even when I wanted to. I also didn’t make time for regularly reviewing the material/notes. I also feel like I don’t know how to study properly because on every midterm this quarter, I scored slightly or way below average. Almost every day since a few months ago, I’ve researched study habits online. The most common advice I saw are reading the textbook before lecture, starting homework early, reviewing notes using spaced repetition and preparing for an exam a week prior. The only thing I’ve done successfully is reading the textbook. Like how the hell do you do all of those things on the same day/week? I tried to do things right: I downloaded programs on my computer and phone that block Facebook/YouTube/reddit and other distracting apps, I meditated almost daily, used Pomodoro, and made a daily schedule. But I still feel like time hasn’t been on my side. So right now, I believe my time management skills and study techniques are the root causes of my academic performance this quarter. After these two classes, I’m not sure if partaking computer engineering or computer science is right for me. You may be asking “do you like computer engineering?”. My honest answer is: I *kind of* like it. I never hated the material I was learning. I don’t think it’s boring either. I’m not super into it or fascinated by it. (Although I did sort of enjoy the lower div CS classes and circuit analysis courses I took in my first two years.) I originally chose CE in high school because I thought computers were cool devices so why not learn how exactly they work while earning a degree that can bring me a lot of opportunities. I’m not sure where to go from here now. Since my gpa for the quarter will be very low, the university may dismiss me. I can get back in with a letter of appeal but I don’t know if I should continue next quarter or take a break.(I may have to continue because I’m having a hard time finding a replacement for my apartment.) I’m not sure about leaving my major either because where will I go when I do? I also don’t want to turn my first two years into a waste (especially when my parents spent a lot of time of money for me). I’m not exactly sure what kind of advice I’m looking for here... just any direction I guess. I know I should decide for myself but I’m really lost. Any advice and the time to read this whole thing will be very much appreciated. **TL;DR:** 3rd year comp. engineering major who’s been pulling decent grades until this quarter. Tried to apply different techniques to improve my studying but academic performance turned out much worse in comparison to that of previous quarters. Feeling very upset and lost. Don’t know if I should take a break from school or not. Don’t know if I should continue with my major but where will I go when I leave?",a6b30d,self.college,,True
First semester of college,college,"My first semester of college is over and I ended with a 3.34 gpa which is pretty disappointing.

I got a B+ in music which I was expecting but a C+ in Bio is just unacceptable. It’s crazy to me how the class average is a 67 and there’s no curve. Nobody got an A. This class is basically death for my gpa. It is just my first semester but it’s actually pretty worrying. I didn’t even manage to get an A in any class, all A-‘s. These are classes I figured to be easy As. I’m just really worried about the future and obsessively looking at gpa calculators online to see how to bring it up and how long it’ll take. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and people have told me Bio 1010 and introductory classes are usually the hardest and considered “weed out” classes.

I am beginning to seriously regret my college major choice - is this normal? Looking for advice.,college,"**TL/DR: I made my college/major choice based off of salary and job outlook and not off of something I actually enjoyed doing and was passionate about. Now I am beginning to realize the mistake I've made and I'm not sure what to do - I'm unhappy and I'm completely lost.** &#x200B; I'm a 21 year old junior currently in his 5th semester at a well-respected technical college in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. I graduated high school in 2016, not really sure about what I wanted to do as a career. I was a good student, graduated in the top, say, 30-40 in my class (so middle of the pack), and also got Eagle Scout in 2015. In high school I cherished three things, particularly: art, music, and primarily history. While looking for colleges however I realized that none of those three 'professions', per say, made a respectable living salary in comparison with other career choices. &#x200B; So, in a hasty panic, I chose the next-best option: I loved to cook and eat, so why not do something in culinary arts and hospitality? And so I found myself on the doorstep of Pennsylvania College of Technology and took a tour. My initial reaction was basically 'Wow, this school is perfect. Good social opportunities (it seems), great instructors, a perfectly blended combination of hands-on and classroom education'. So I applied and was pretty easily accepted. My first semester (Fall 2016) was fantastic - I managed to get on the Dean's List (requirement of 3.5 GPA) with a GPA of 3.73 and knew I had made the right choice. Perhaps this field could be a hidden gem. And this is where the optimism ends... &#x200B; My second semester (Spring 2017) was an unmitigated disaster. I finished with a GPA barely over 3 (3.07 I think). My kitchen lab professor and math professors were terrible. I was getting poor grades I hadn't really ever gotten before. And on top of this I had an internship requirement for that summer. Let's just say that this internship ended up being the most frustrating and crushing two months of my entire life, and we'll keep it at that. My third semester (Fall 2017) was decent as I was recovering from my awful internship and took a break from the kitchen (due to the funkiness of the curriculum) and had classes that focused on my beverage management concepts. &#x200B; Fourth semester (Spring 2018) was my turning point. Mid-February I had realized that I had made a mistake in my major choice and decided on either transferring to a new school (in which I'd run the risk of almost none of my credits transferring making my first 2 years at Penn College a complete waste) or stay within Penn College's School of Business and Hospitality and go from culinary arts -applied business management and hospitality management dual-bachelors. &#x200B; So here I am typing this now with finals starting next week, my fifth semester coming to a close. It had been an alright semester, given that I have just switched majors over the summer. Currently though I am not very happy - my social life here sucks (the social opportunities here are comically minimal and most students here aren't that sociable anyways - and I'm more of an omnivert), there aren't that many extracurricular options that have garnered my interest (most students here aren't enrolled in clubs or the clubs are very, VERY small). The town, Williamsport, is void of anything fun to do. &#x200B; I'm lost, and I'm not happy about the current path that I am on. Yet I feel like I've come to this realization a bit too late and I've fucked myself over already and now I'm just paying the price, figuratively and literally. I know that if I decide to change schools and majors I am basically rendering my education over the last 2-3 years obsolete and putting myself back at square one. &#x200B; What should I do?

Senior in college Need financial advice,college,"I will try to keep this brief but i’m not the best at that. I have always had problems with my parents, and about 4 months ago I cut ties with them and they were the ones paying my tuition. I was at a breaking point where their financial assistance was not worth the burden/abuse/impact it was having on personal and professional life. I have not regretted my decision yet but now I am in an awful financial situation. I literally just registered yesterday after taking out my first $30k loan ever, and its finals week. I just had to pay $1000 to fix my car so I can go drive 12hrs to spend christmas with my sister because I have no where else to stay for break. Basically my point is... I have 1000 in my bank account. That thousand will most likely be gone by the time I drive back up to my school for next semester. I have an internship next semester that pays min wage but due to my late registration, I will have to do that for credit next semester rather than pay. I am desperate for a job but I can’t find anywhere that is hiring that I haven’t already applied to.

I;ve completed all my non-major requirements (except two classes i'm taking next semester) as well as General Biology I and II, General Chemistry I and II, Physics I and II, and Organic Chemistry I. I'm not so sure about working in healthcare but my father's insistence that I become a doctor has pushed me this far. I completed a Biostatistics course this semester and did some of someone's general statistics homework... and it interests me The whole idea of analyzing data, calculating uncertainty, and testing null and alternate hypotheses actually sound interesting to me. Plus, it lines up with programming which I was interested in before my Dad snuffed that idea out freshman year. But I have to change my major completely. I was thinking of a mathematics major and a computer science minor and going to grad school for a master's in statistics. It's scary thinking about this because even thought I've done Calculus I already during my first semester and enjoyed it, I haven't done math since then. This would also delay my bachelor's and cause me to take out private loans for the last year. I've also not taken a formal programming course (I played around a bit with Python 3 years ago and I learned how to use some R in Biostatistics but still).

To anyone thinking of switching majors:,college,"I switched majors from Kinesiology to Computer Science this year, and I think it is the best decision I could have made. I was doing well in my classes too, 3.6 GPA, thinking of applying for honours, etc. But I was not happy. I just was kinda going through the motions with my classes and I knew if that was the case, then I would just be going through the motions with my career. I started learning Python to get into coding and fell in love. It is so much fun just to have the freedom to create, and in this exploration I discovered my passion for coding. Now I'm no genius or what have you, in fact my C in Grade 12 would love to say otherwise but I know that this is what will make me happy. So basically my advice is to not just do something for the money, but to try and follow something you are really passionate about. But also be realistic about the job market, if that is one of your concerns. tl;dr follow your dreams my dudes.",a4azk1,self.college,,True

How a professor really helped me out,college,"Can we share some stories about helpful professors before the doom and gloom of the next semester is upon us? I'm new to posting in this community, but I've been wanting to share a really nice story about how one of my professors helped me out when I was having bad exam anxiety. I'd also love to hear nice stories from anyone else. &#x200B; For 4 semesters in a row, I had physics labs in the same room. Since lab sessions are longer than the lectures, profs tended to give us tests then even if the lab rooms weren't designed for it. In the lab, we were seated in groups of 4 at these round tables. To prevent cheating, the department had these white cardboard dividers that they used to split up the table. All was fine for my first 2 semesters but come my third semester, I started having some bad exam anxiety at the sight of those dividers. It was a pavlovian response; I would see the dividers and start to panic even if I knew we didn't have a test that day. I toughed it out for a while, but during my fourth semester I confided this to a friend and realized how bad it really was. One day, a lab techs left a divider in the corner. I hadn't noticed it was there until that friend pointed it out to me and I physically recoiled. I got up the courage to ask one of my physics teachers for help. I told my teacher about it during his office hours and he was so accommodating, offered to let me write the exam in another room if it would be easier for me. At that point I sort of panicked and left his office, saying I was going to be fine. Later in the day, he wrote me an email saying that making an accommodation was really no problem for him and he was more than happy to help. Keep in mind I'm not registered with the school's accessibility center and so he is under no obligation to help me out. I arranged to do some practice problems in the lab room with the divider so that I could convince myself that the dividers aren't dangerous and I managed to overcome my fear of them. It may seem silly, but that act of kindness from that professor really made a difference for me that semester ",ab2ce9,self.college,,True
on transferring and fit,college,"I've been thinking about transferring for a while now. there are a few things about my current uni that I don't vibe with, and my major only has 2 concentrations, both of which i'm not super interested in. I found another school that offers the same major with more concentrations (including the one that i'm most interested in) and with a more appealing student body, location, rigor, etc.... that being said, my current uni is my state school and i'm paying little to attend each year (3.3k, roughly). yet i don't find myself happy here. the school that i want to transfer to is private but top tier so they're pretty good with financial aid. when i used the net price calculator, however, it was 5.9k (without workstudy), which is just out of what my family can afford. despite being upset at my current uni, is it worth it to transfer (especially as a low income student)? fit is a privilege which ive sadly come to realize -- shouldn't i just be content with the fact that i'm getting a college education from a strong university with good academics? sure they only offer a part of what i want to study, but maybe i could try and really hone in on what i want to study through a minor or double major... ive been struggling with this pretty heavily for quite some time now. i know i could be successful at my current uni after 4 years and save a ton of money. at the same time i could be happier elsewhere at the expense of more money and possibly debt :/ any input or advice would be greatly greatly appreciated, thank you so much",aa75io,self.college,,True

Tough First Semester,college,"So I just finished up my first semester of college. I'm studying Business and came to college with like 12 credit hours or so. Anyways, I had a few scholarships, grants, and other stuff going into the year, so my loans were only like $5,000 for a year. The scholarships were due to me having a 3.7 GPA in high school and a 30 on the ACT. My high school only offered one AP class (Calculus) and I passed it with a low A / high B. High school was pretty easy for me, and I never had to study or do much homework. I'm not trying to bran, and you'll see why in the rest of this post. &#x200B; I took 17 credit hours my first semester of college. I'm also in the Honors program (required to take 6 credit hours of Honors classes a year I think and keep a 3.7 GPA). This would've been fine, however, I got a scholarship for $500 a semester that made me take a class. This was a service class and made me do a certain amount of volunteer work (no problem) but also write a bunch of papers and other stuff. I didn't see the point in the class and never ended up doing any of the work. There was another class that I actually had a bit of trouble with because I was forced to do a lot of reading and writing papers over the reading. This class was actually by Honors class. These two classes led to my demise. &#x200B; I took a few gen eds (math, science, theater) and a business class. All of these classes I ended with an 82%+ so it wasn't terrible. However, those other two classes I mentioned earlier, I ended with a 46% and 69% (Honors class), respectively. This brought my GPA extremely low, and I just received an email saying I'm on Academic Probation because my GPA is below the university's standards. &#x200B; How can I go about ensuring I keep some/all of my scholarships (I desperately need them as my family isn't exactly wealthy and we have 3 other kids to send to college)? Also, if possible, to keep my Honors status. It isn't as important to me as I don't see it as a big deal, but it'd still be nice. It's my fault that I messed up these classes but college is completely different than high school. &#x200B; I know I should talk to my Academic advisor. I'll be doing that at the start of the semester, but until then, what other suggestions do you guys have to give me? My girlfriend and other friends are willing to help me next semester with actually getting my homework done and everything, but I'm really worried about this semester. ",aa7qd7,self.college,,True

Is my GPA screwed because of a bad first year?,college,"TD;DR at bottom So I took a pre-health course in my first year not because I necessarily needed it but because; I needed my biology mark to meet the prerequisites for going into massage therapy, I wanted to get a ‘feel’ for college before I hit the real deal, and I wanted to maybe get this course under my belt incase it came of use in the future. But this semester went completely downhill. I failed a lot of my courses and the ones I didn’t fail I got a terrible mark in. I’m devastated but I’m not surprised since I didn’t keep up, I didn’t study and I went belly up after I found out that I was at risk. I’ve decided that I definitely would not be moving into the second semester because I will be spending this semester retaking my biology course and focussing on my learning/study strategies so I can hopefully make it into my massage therapy course (don’t need to do the HPAT test). Also, I have a learning disability which means I am a lot slower to comprehend subjects which was all the more reason that I should study harder but I did the complete opposite and by the time I found out I was failing it was too late to keep myself caught up while trying to make up for what I had missed. So since I have an IEP and I didn’t finish this pre-health course I was wondering if these terrible marks will permanently affect my future marks or opportunities. TL;DR : took a pre-health course to get a ‘feel’ for college, completely botched the first semester and won’t be returning to this course. Will this affect my future in college? If so in what ways?

Should I change my major and/or consider transferring?,college,Hello everyone I’m sorry for posting this huge essay .. I’m just not sure where else to ask this? I can’t ask my parents or teachers because they’ll be disappointed. I just finished my first semester of freshman year as a music major. During highschool I couldn’t imagine doing anything else other than music. But now I’m not sure if this is the right path for me..I was unmotivated and depressed for most of the semester and the only class I enjoyed was my one academic class - psychology. The problem is that I entered this university as a music major so I took all music courses last semester (except for psych)...im at this school for a LARGE scholarship for music and don’t know what to do. I wish I were taking gen eds and just exploring like 99% of college kids do. I don’t feel passionate about anything anymore and wish I were learning normal academic stuff. I stayed in my hometown and want to leave SO BADLY. The school I’m at is a big party school (I’m more of the quiet nerd type) and I feel like I don’t fit in. I want to have a fresh start. I DID get a 3.7 or 3.8 last semester but it was for basically all music courses. Does this make it impossible for me to transfer (possibly) to a new school for junior or sophomore year ?

I can’t tolerate my roommate’s smell,college,"(Tldr at the end) My roommate seems to be quite oblivious sometimes (for example she never uses headphones and talks on the phone until 1 am) but what bothers me the most is her smell. She doesn’t work out or anything, but she always smells like she just did a triathlon. It’s the most intense BO I’ve ever smelled. I have never smelled anything like this before, and I’ve had to put up with it for half the year so far. I tried a plug in air freshener and it doesn’t work. The smell stays for a few minutes after she leaves, then comes right back when she does. She said she “doesn’t like” showering because she “doesn’t like when things are wet” (???) so she showers maybe 2-3 times a week. When she does shower, she smells again in the morning. One time I walked in at night and the room smelled fishy. She was casually walking around the room with no pants in tight underwear. My other roommate says this is just her natural scent and she can’t do anything about it. Still I feel like she should at least take more showers and use perfume to keep it under control (but she doesn’t even own perfume). My dorm is suite style and has a common area so I have to sit in there when she’s in the room, but I find it unfair that she basically made my room uninhabitable for me. I feel like there’s no polite way to tell someone they stink but I’m desperate. Sometimes I can’t even sleep because the sweat/fish smell is so powerful. I would talk to my RA but she’s too bubbly and friendly and she can’t really tell someone they stink either. I don’t know what else to do, any advice?

first semester done and...,college,"Currently, I am sitting in my dorm room, procrastinating on studying for my finals, and I'm realizing with my first semester of college almost done, that I have no real friends. I go to a really large public university in Wisconsin, so first off, it seems hard to initiate any sort of interactions, knowing I will most likely never see this person's face again. I don't really know how this happened, because I'm not terribly socially awkward, though I think I come off as kind of intimidating. I sometimes can have a sort of hater mentality, where I think everyone sucks and I wouldn't like any of them. Which I think a lot of the times is true, most people kind of do suck. I'm definitely an introvert, but I still want friends that I can become close with and spend time with. I think the problem is I'm in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend, he goes to a school in the same city, so we hang out almost every day. Also, my sister just recently moved to this same city, and I love spending time with her. So I already have two people to spend time with and who I already feel comfortable with. I think maybe I'm more of the 'sink or swim' type of person when it comes to making friends, where I'll only make them out of sheer desperation and loneliness. But I'm seeing everyone in their groups of friends, eating Cheetos and studying together, and I want that. I only had really one friend in high school, so maybe it's just me? I started an intramural basketball team here, and I really liked some of the people on my team, but after the season ended everyone stopped playing together. Maybe I should have tried to make more of an effort to hang out with them outside of basketball? But it seems like no one is making an effort to hang out with me. I texted one girl on the team and we hang out sometimes, but she's only like a 'going out' friend, who I go to parties with. I don't think we could ever be real friends. I took a year off after high school, so I'm older, and not to be pretentious but I think more mature, than most of the people I meet. Also, I chose the dorm I live in specifically because it was known for being very social and fun, but I'm not close with my roommate and don't even know who lives across from me.

questions about community college pre-requisites and credits,college,"So I'm 19 and in my second year at community college. Right now I'm taking pre-recs for an ultrasound program for different schools, as my CC doesn't have this program. After I finish all my pre-recs for the programs I'm going to apply to, I won't have an associate's degree until I finish the actual program. If i get into an diagnostic medical ultrasound program somewhere, great. But if I don't, I will have taken all these courses and be without an associate's degree. I could get an associate's as a science transfer, but I would have to take a few chemistry classes and another biology course just to have the actual science transfer associate's degree. I'm not entirely sure if that's worth it take all these other classes and spend all this money just to have the title of a degree that wouldn't be my end goal. I will provide at the bottom of what classes I will have completed when I apply to this program. It would be ideal that if I try to do something else, i can still utilize the courses I've already taken rather than start over with new courses. My question is: based on the courses I will complete before i hypothetically get accepted into this program, if i were to NOT get into this program and try to pursue another degree, what would be the best way to try to find out what other program has the closest pre-recs to my courses? I want to find out based on my courses completed, what would be the easiest way to see what other programs that are related to the one i'm looking at (diagnostic medical ultrasound A.A.S) and which programs are similar in terms of pre-recs. I'm not entirely centered around convenience, I'm not going to choose a program that's similar to mine if I don't think I'm going to love it, I just want to see what my options are. I am more focused though about what's going to make me happy, not what is the easiest or what makes the most money. Any advice is appreciated. &#x200B; (courses i will have completed: 3 communication classes, 2 psychology classes, 3 biology classes, physics, history, ethics, sociology, film appreciation, cultural geography, medical terminology)",a5j8mn,self.college,,True

Conflicted biomedical engineering student burnt out by STEM curriculum,college,"Okay so a bit about me: I am UCDavis 3rd year biomedical engineering student. I’ve always been a good student and found interest in every subject. However I had a lot of passion for sociology, theory, human behavior etc. I chose engineering because I was analytical, good at math, it was interesting, and a career was promising and secure. My freshman year and part of sophomore year I doubted my ability to be an engineer. College has been beyond difficult and I’m not necessarily referring to the academic part of college. College has been an emotional struggle for reasons that are too extensive to actually write about so just trust me (I’m sure most of you can relate). Anyway I’m currently in my third year and there has been a drastic shift. My mother suddenly left me and my family for a new family and the entire experience has left me conflicted. The emotional battle with school has definitely left me depressed and uninterested in many of my courses. At first I thought it was because I was in a bit of a pit/depression causing me to lack interest in everything. However as I sit with myself more and more I see myself changing. By that I mean my opinions, beliefs, interests and goals. I am three years into my proposed major/career only to realize it’s not me at all. In fact it’s the opposite. Now this is where I need advice. Do I: A. Continue my major simply to get the degree and look for a job I’m truly interested in after college even though I have no intent of being an engineer. With the following statement in mind -‘most people don’t even use the degree they got for what it was intended for’ although it may be difficult to get a job and get experience if in a different major. B. Switch majors into something I really enjoy, add an extra year maybe even 2 years to my degree. Pull out more student loans and further myself into more debt. Keep in mind I don’t know what I ‘really enjoy’ yet either and a job is not promised after college. C. Continue my major and become my intended major/career by ignoring my lack of interests in the courses due the fact that I’m emotionally distracted. The overall advice I have is mostly from your guys’s past experiences. How much did you actually use your degree, ha it helped you, how did you know your true interests/passions, if you don’t know how do you find your interests etc so you do know.

Too obsessed with GPA? Need advice?,college,"So, I have gotten all A’s for every semester I’ve been in community college (five semesters so far).

Textbook Confusion?,college,"Hi guys. I will be a new student at my college this 2019 Winter Quarter. It's been a bumpy ride for me. I am returning to school after dropping out of my senior year of high school (2015) and having just recently obtained my GED in March of this year, am making the leap for college. I am a person that needs to make sure I do everything as correctly as possible when it comes to something like this, and I can't say I've enjoyed the enrollment process so far (so many hoops to jump through lol). Anyways, the point of this post is about my textbooks. I was stressing out about purchasing my textbooks when I remembered this morning that my school sent out an email about our online bookstore on outlook (On December 4th). Our bookstore is connected to barnes noble, it's a unique website and it takes you to a page where you simply have to look up your course(s) and it pulls up a page that lists which books you need. That part was easy. So I went in person and purchased what I needed from the on-campus store to make sure I had it right-away. Came home, and suddenly remembered that I could probably check my college's website for staff websites to try and find my syllabuses. I found my professor's website and her syllabus for one of my classes, but for Fall 2018. I came across her blurb about textbooks and saw that she mentioned needing the 7th edition of it. I am freaking out now. I checked the version I have - 6th edition. I have already unwrapped it and fitted it into my binder. I went and checked our online bookstore again, it says that the 6th edition is the required version. I was even helped by a clerk at the on-campus bookstore to find my textbooks. So I decided to write up an email thinking I could ask her if this edition was an acceptable version to use. I instantly got an automated response saying that she was off-contract during break and would not be checking her email until January 2nd, which is when my first day of class is.

[USA] At what point in university is one not allowed to repeat a class they failed or withdrawn?,college,"I ask as I'm at my local community college and have to repeat Physics 2 (calculus-based electromagnetism optics), and this will be the 3rd class I will need to repeat during my time at this college (I have around 50 credits am almost done my major here).

Seeking credible online school for Information Technology BS.,college,"I'll try to keep this short, but it's a bit of a lengthy situation so hopefully all of this information doesn't hurt your head. I'm currently stationed overseas (USAF) and have just one class needed for my CCAF Associates in Avionics Technology. Now most of those credits may not transfer to a degree in Information Technology, but I did start 30+ credits in Information Systems Management through my community college about 4 years ago. Some may or may not transfer and I know that's up to the school to accept them. My biggest concern is being able to complete my BS around 2022 since I am trying to commission and get a rated job. Being that I'm currently 28, I cannot be older than 32 to apply for a rated job. I would like to keep my course load to about 2-3 courses a semester and even 3 is pushing it. Some CLEPs / DSSTs might help expedite the degree, but I know that not all of those will help with the more advanced level courses required to get a BS. I also have a 1 year old daughter and wife here at the house while working about 50 hours a week. I'm hoping that there are some accelerated classes and if not through the college I'm currently looking at (Arizona State University), I'm curious if I could take courses that are accelerated through another college or program and transfer those credits towards ASU (or another college). To get to the main point, I'm trying to find the best path for me to take with my situation mentioned above. I understand that this will be quite a laboring time for me to endure, but I'm pretty good with time management and I've been very comfortable at home and work with plenty of time to spare. Worse case scenario, I'm unable to apply for a rated job and I'll just grab my commission into the field I'm looking to get my BS in. Hopefully some, if not all, of this makes sense and I'm willing to elaborate on any confusing points. I might be crazy for trying to squeeze this all in at once, but I have faith I can do this. &#x200B; TL;DR - I work a lot and have a fairly steady to busy home life.

For the next semester I have a few Honors classes lined up with regular classes, and I’m once again telling myself that “this is gonna be my semester, this is when I’ll FINALLY get my act together.” But I know deep down that considering I tell myself this before literally every semester starts and I never live up to it, I’m probably going to just end up failing next semester, too. I have extremely education oriented parents and both of my siblings are high achievers with good grades (older brother is currently at Berkeley). If I dropped out of college, I’d probably be seen as a failed loser and then disowned or some shit. I don’t really know where to go from here because I feel like continuing my education just isn’t going to work, my parents will kill me if I drop out, but I don’t want to get sucked into the depressing hole of working retail or some other grim job for the rest of my life either.

I’m in some dinky honors bachelor program for illustration and it feels like I’m throwing in so much money for a title and job that any average person can do without a degree.

Everyone in my family has jobs where they can live a middle class life and it always feels like I am the underdog who can’t measure up to anyone because of my chosen career path.

Finding a new roommate off campus?,college,"For those who lived on campus and then moved off campus in their later years at college, how did you go about finding a new roommate?

How many years did you spend going to college (or have you spent so far)? Should I feel bad?,college,"Unfortunately, I have been going to my local community college for quite some time now and **I feel bad about it. Should I?** Is it just me or is college itself time consuming? I am curious, how long did college take you to 100% complete what you wanted to achieve? &#x200B; Let me try to give you an idea of my path. First, I started going to my community college in fall of 2013 and I have not missed a single semester since! However, when I first started going to college, I believe that I had very low assessment scores which resulted in me taking very basic classes such as pre-algebra and so on. Long story short, I was a high school dropout so I had some catching up to do. &#x200B; Moving on, I majored in computer science. Along the way, I will admit that I had a few mistakes. Although, I am an A/B student for the most part in all my years. With all of that in mind, after 3 years of pursuing the CS transfer degree, I felt like it was taking too long and I was having doubts about calculus and physics. As a result, I decided to spend year 4 pursuing a different degree as a backup plan (associates in computer programming) which I was successful in doing and graduated in spring of 2017. &#x200B; However, the following year I decided to return to finish what I started with computer science. As you read this now, I have two semesters left for the computer science transfer degree (Spring 2019 and Fall 2019), but once I am done, **I would have spent around 6 years going to community college and this is of course not including any time spent at a university (since I am not there yet). Is that bad?** I mean, I am positive it is not normal, but does it really matter? As long as I get the job done? Just to get this off my chest, I have probably wasted so much time taking classes not relevant to my degree such as sociology, music, art, history, etc. (because I had to for gen. ed).",a5wz3y,self.college,,True

How stressful is commuting to school?,college,"I'm in a bit of a pickle. I have ~12 credits left to graduate (6 in my major, 1 in my minor, 5 that can be literally any other class) after accounting for the classes I have next semester. At 12 credits minimum to be full time, I'll be able to graduate after first semester senior year. The problem is money. My parents pay most of everything so affording my last semester isn't a problem. Problem is, once I'm done with school they no longer pay -- meaning I'd be paying the full cost of rent from Jan-Aug if I lived at school (you won't find a lease that's not 12 months around here and since everyone studies abroad second semester, subletting really doesn't work most of the time). I obviously don't want to do that, so I'm considering commuting from my family's house about 15-20 minutes away for a single semester before I graduate.

Applying to colleges as a transfer student.,college,"Hi everyone, I'm a veteran who is starting college after finishing my time in the military honorably, completing my first semester of community college in VA. I'm going to start applying to schools and visiting ones high on my list during the upcoming spring semester. My situation isn't something that I thought would be too unique, but figured I would run by you all to ensure a good amount of responses. The schools that I'm looking at are both public and private institutions. Because of this I'm concerned what credits I'll be able to transfer. Anytime I talk to a private school they're hesitant to look at my advisement report and give me a confident, or even semi-confident, answer as to what might be eligible for transfer if I decided to further my education with them. With this being kept in mind, I realize that if I were to transfer to a state or public school from community college, with the current agreements in place, it would make the most sense to get 60 credits at my community college, then transfer, due to the CC's cost/credit hour. That isn't the case with private schools though, as I can't be certain what would transfer and what wouldn't. From this comes my question: If I were to apply to a public school now, and was accepted for the fall 2019 semester, would I have to go? And if I chose not to, would this be held against me in a negative way later on, should I apply to them for the 2020 semester? And what if I get accepted to one of the private schools I'm looking at and decide to postpone for whatever reason? Do I have to attend at the next available opportunity?

Returning to college to finish an incomplete CS major... ten years after finishing undergraduate school.,college,"I graduated with an BA in digital media from a state university some 10 years ago, and got into web development as a career. 7 years experience total, on and off. I can do full-stack web, bouncing between front-end and back-end, but I'm getting burned out from it. I want to pursue other kinds of software development but a combination of two things are holding me back. **First, because I chose an Art degree I did not make an optimal choice for Computer Science.** I got into some CS classes after approval from the college but not enough to complete a CS major. It's easier to get short-listed for companies that are highly engineer focused (I'm talking more low-level programming) when you have relevant experience, and web dev won't cut it. **Second, I cannot rely on my network for better jobs.** The jobs I've worked at are at some very small, super-lean places and were not great places to network. Turnover is usually high, and software development felt very isolated (most devs were working remote or off-shore). Usually, networking would be your best way to move to more ideal jobs, but that's if you could salvage some good connections out of your current job. For me, these jobs didn't set me up well to build bridges for better job opportunities. So I have graduated with an Art degree that I no longer use and have some CS classes that I took years ago. And I'm re-considering my education options and want to ask how I should approach with my situation. How probable is it to return to college to finish an incomplete major? Even if it's the same college you got your BA from? I also know that just getting the degree isn't enough... so I envision myself also networking more in academic clubs, taking internships, talking to professors, all things that I avoided doing when I was younger and an undergrad.

"I'm unsure of my path in college and after, and am considering everything from business to physics.",college,"I'm a freshman at Notre Dame who just finished his first semester, and I'm using my time on winter break to plan out what major I should take and what course I want my life to take afterwards. Right now I'm in ND's College of Business and by the end of this year I'll be halfway done with the Econ major (which is in ND's College of Arts Letters, not Business). After taking a class in management, I'm not really sure if I want to continue in business. The only reason I'm in it is because it's hard to get into at Notre Dame unless you apply for it as a high school senior, and since I thought I might be interested in it I applied for it. I figured that if I didn't like it, it would be easy for me to transfer out of it. My parents want me to continue in it because ND's undergrad business program is very well regarded (top 3) and business can open a lot of doors.. in industry. To that end, the vast majority of people in that college go work in business (go figure) for generally one of fifteen companies like Deloitte, but, to be honest, I don't really see myself doing that. I'm much too ambitious to settle for just a path in business. The college of business requires too many classes for me to pursue something I'm not that interested in, and besides, can't I just get my MBA if I wanna do business later? In contrast, I've been interested in similarities between the physical world and how society runs. I'm very much interested in expanding on that thought process into formal research and writings; to that end, I've been interested in getting a PhD, especially in economics (as much of how society organized itself is through economics, and I'm interested in the subject itself). To that end, I've been taking Econ and math courses for grad school, and have looked into various business/econ internships (at least abroad for this summer). Because I want to connect that with the physical world, I've looked into taking ND's physics supplemental major. Though I only took one physics class in HS I liked it, I really, really enjoyed reading *A Brief History of Time,* and I'm good at and enjoy math. Thus, the physics major seems good to me. In addition to this, ND has a neat Philosophy, Science, and Math major which I could get with five classes in addition to the math courses I'd take. Because I like thinking about science in a bit of a philosophical point of view, it seems like that program would be a good fit for me. Thus, I guess the current plan is to major in Econ, PSM, and maybe Physics, and drop my place in the business college. Then I'd go onto an Econ PhD, hopefully in a prestigious university in the UK or elsewhere in Europe (I wanna live abroad at least for a few years). My issues with this are the following: 1. As my parents and peers keep on telling me, getting a BBA from ND is a fairly good way to make sure I'm financially stable in the future. I'm worried a bit about losing that security for this. 2. This plan is pretty hard on me on multiple fronts. Getting a triple major would be very difficult as I'd have to overload multiple semesters, and I've read on this sub that triple majoring doesn't even look very good. Moreover, not getting into a prestigious econ PhD program anywhere is obviously a very real possibility. And, if I did get in, getting a PhD is very difficult. While I'm passionate about the subject and I have a good work ethic and writing skill, it's still obviously hard to do no matter what. 3. This path sets me up well for academia, but I'm not sure I wanna do that for the rest of my life. I love learning and I think I'd like teaching college, but everything I've heard about academia's politics and overall quality of life is bad. 4. Instead of academia, I have other career interests too, like policy advising (especially about climate change), doing some international development work, maybe getting into politics myself, and again, maybe business. I'm not sure I'd set myself up that well with this plan. Finally, I'm not sure if I should even stay at ND, and I think I have a fair shot at getting into a school that better suits me. I hate how insular the campus is, I hate its location, the social life is... lame, its pre-professional nature doesn't line up well with my own more academic interests, much of its academic offerings aren't the *absolute* best, and my individualist streak doesn't match its emphasis on conformity. On the other hand, I love how friendly people are here, I like that the school cares for its undergrads by having good teachers and research opportunities (though advising and choosing classes is poor), and I love that I'd always have ND connections to rely on. Plus, it's close to home and other than UChicago I don't know where I'd apply. Sorry for the wall of text -- I'm in a weird point in life and I don't know where I'm going. If anyone has any advice for me (like addressing my worries or whether any of my plans make sense) I'd be uber grateful. Thank you for reading if you made it this far! &#x200B; TL;DR I don't like the path I'm taking in business, I have some academic interests I'd like to pursue via double- or even triple-majoring with a PhD, but I'm still not sure if that's the path for me for various reasons. Also, I don't know if I should stay in my current college or go elsewhere, so any advice would be very much appreciated!",ab3fvs,self.college,,True

Does anybody living on campus get those weird feeling?,college,"Going out to those living in dorms, I’ve felt weird. It’s weird to get up at 805 for an 830 class and be early, while the commuter girl sitting next to you had to wake up at 530 to catch the bus. It’s weird to go home at night, whether you have a roommate or not, and eat dining hall food, and know somebody’s at home with a family and probably having a home cooked meal, while you eat old pizza because all your dorm serves is pasta. Sometimes you might not even leave campus, and I’ll admit it was weird to me. I couldn’t leave the first 5 days, so it was like a bubble in the middle of nowhere, even if after a 50 foot stretch of trees there was a town. I was in a summer program for underprivileged kids, so we were working from 830 to 1030 most days. We’re an open campus so some of the neighbors would walk their dogs on campus, and it got so weird knowing we were learning and suffering and they were at home with their families enjoying vacation. You only get that feeling if you live on campus. ",a5g3za,self.college,,True

Will I win this appeal,college,Hello I am a radiology student in my first semester. Unfortunately in the beginning semester my fiancee cheated on me and that messed me up a lot and my grades fell. I picked them all up except one positioning. I failed with a 79.604 I need an 80 to pass. I want to appeal a proficiancy where we move students to get the best image. I looked up discrepancies between the book and what the grading professor did. We are taught to study the book for these proficiancies. I also looked at the grading rubric and in there I see only one possible reason for my automatic zero and that is not getting all the anatomy. However I believe that I did as I had a light field correct and she was the proper distance away. The professor said I didnt have the light field over an entire plate but not in the rubric nor the book does it say it needs to be.

The college my friend went to had some iffy ways of keep statistics,college,"I'm not going to o name the college because I don't want to specifically shame them.

There were just a couple things wrong with that listing. 1. She was a Cinema major and the job she had was waitressing/housekeeping at an inn. This is obviously not related to her degree nor is it a job she planned to keep for a long period of time. 2. She already had this job before she even started going to school there. I'm currently at a community college, and I've been trying to find somewhere to transfer to, and this has made me suspicious of any statistics the college claims to have, especially when it relates to jobs.

Every consuleor has told me to either major in communications or english but I'm not sure, I thought about buisness but they sound like risky degrees to get and I cannot go back to my parents house (not a good home life) all I kind of view my degree is something to make money before my music ever takes off, but what are your thoughts? I also thought about audio engineering but I essentially have already taught myself it (I dont want to major in music, I did not enjoy my music classes i've been in besides one) TL;DR: Wanna be musician, never understood why im at college, I need to find a degree I can stand to make money since none has been made from music yet, Counselors suggest communications and English but they sound risky &#x200B; Help me wise people of reddit.",aaequp,self.college,,True

What makes college harder then other forms of education?,college,"Hello! Okay, so to start off I am in Canada myself. And I did try googling the above question, but I was unable to find any real satsifying answers other then 'Yes it is harder.' I am planning on eventually going to College for something, still not sure yet. Been out of High School for about 6 years now and been in the workforce for most of that time while I was trying to decide what I want to do. Back during High School, and even during work for that matter, I am someone that catches on to concepts fairly quickly once shown and done a few times. (normally I have something down pat after less then a week, most times 2-3 days). Which was great for High School grades, as long as I remembered to do the work so I would have it commuted to memory then I would be able to easily get 90%-100% on tests and some projects. Even if I might have forgotten said information less then a year after last using it. Anyway, during my research to try and figure out what I want to do in College if I ever do go, I have discovered a lot of people saying that College is hard mode with High School and even outside of work experiences being considered easy comparatively. What exactly makes College harder then say High School? Is it that there is simply a lower standard to teaching? That they don't give enough time so people can learn? Do they not teach what is required in the classes and instead promote self study (Then what is the point of going if they are just promoting self study?). Like, what about it makes it so much harder then typical schooling? As an aside, I have no idea where to even start when it comes to looking into college stuff. What people to contact if any, etc etc. But that is stuff more so to be dealt with once I have an idea of what I want to do. I do know I want to do something involving language, learning a second and third language, linguistics and those sorts of things.",a41nz8,self.college,,True

Basic Questions from an Obstinate Student,college,"So I'm 22 and going back to community college with an intent to get into University of Washington. I'm a great student and utilize a lot of different resources to succeed academically... But I'm one stubborn S.O.B. I have anxiety so it hinders me from easily asking for help. So as I've struggled finding a career/academic path for the past few years I've never gone to an advisor. I'm pretty sure I have to now, though. I'm going back to school and my goal is to get my Associates in Biology - my school has a direct transfer agreement with UW so it's pretty much perfect. But I'm not omniscient and have so many questions as to what order I need to take my classes in for this program. Plus I imagine I'd need an advisor to work with UW for admissions anyway. So I guess my questions are these: * Is going to an advisor intimidating? I've just made it a habit to not ask for help and figure things out on my own, mostly because of anxiety. I just don't know if an advisor is quite as intimidating as, say, a therapist (yes, laugh all you want. It's kind of funny) * What does an advisor even do? Like, can they help make me a plan as to which classes I need to take first? Can they help with finding study groups or online resources? I honestly have no clue. * A bit off topic of advisors, but back in high school my career exploration teacher said to make sure you're getting a 'fully packaged Associates' if you go to community college so your intended Uni can't just pick it apart and make you retake a bunch of classes. Is that a thing? Does getting a full Associates prevent that, or at least help prevent it? I imagine my program having a direct transfer agreement with a bunch of different Unis (UW included) probably helps but you just can't be too careful nowadays. Thanks in advance.",aazutv,self.college,,True
For old learners - how did you learn in an age before computers?,college,"When reading any academic book I find the need to write my own version of it, explaining each idea given in my own words. Sometimes there is an outstanding author who writes with simple language but even then I always think the sentences can be better and end up re-writing them too. As you might expect, this method of mine can take a lot of time if using traditional pen and paper. Especially for me, that for some reason have my hands treating the pen as a paint brush and have to write extra slower to make legibility possible. Having these factors in view, I choose to use the laptop to write absolutely everything, since the work can be done much faster. I like the idea of not having my eyes strained though and that's why I'm here. I assume you studied directly from the book; writing your insights on paper from time to time but mostly learning by just reading the book over and over again. This method seems very feasible but sounds so hard to internalize the material with it, after all the information would many times be displayed in cryptocode, with all that convoluted language. Despite of the challenges, you learned! You must tell me how. ",ab0rz6,self.college,,True

Success Story of Getting Your Professor to Know Your Name and Having it Truly Pay Off (Long),college,"This semester I was taking a Comms 120A class, not terribly difficult, but there were only 3 test grades and the final exam. Got 2 A’s and a B on the tests and just had to finish up the final and it’d be over with. The final was a 5-7 minute commencement speech we had to write up as if we were talking to the current graduating class. I wasn’t taking this class too seriously, so I waited until last minute, recorded it on my iPhone and attempted to email it to my professor on the due date. I didn’t take into consideration the file being way too large to send over email, I rushed to the local Meijer to pick up some CD’s so I could burn the video onto them and try and get them to her that night. What I ALSO did not take into consideration was that I’d have to convert the .mov extension that iPhones use to a .wmv so that my windows computer could burn it onto the CD. All of the converters I could find that were legitimate required you to pay and I just didn’t want to do that for a one time thing, (broke college boy). I took into consideration failing the class would cost more than the $12 I’d spend on the converter, so I paid and burned onto the CD. Mind you, I had emailed my professor early this morning asking her if I could come by since her office and office hours were not listed on the online syllabus for whatever reason. She did not reply, but I explained my whole situation to her and I just waited thinking she might read it tomorrow and give me an extension. Tomorrow arrives, no reply, no reply the day after either. A lot of other things were going on at the time, I had physically harmed myself that week, dragging me into a deep depression and my mother had to drive up to come take me home. The class was the last thing on my mind all weekend until Monday rolled around and it dawned on me and a feeling of dread swept over. With only 3 tests and a 0 on the exam, I’d mostly like fail or at least get a very low grade on an easy A class. She had replied to my email the night I was picked up and it read as follows, “Hello Anon, you have actively participated in my class throughout the semester and have proven your understanding of communications in your test scores. I appreciate you trying to contact me and apologize for my late reply, I will give you credit on the assignment. Enjoy your break.” She ended up giving me a 100% on the final she didn’t even know if I had completed or not. Although my scores in the class helped, there were plenty of kids who would just goof off and not take it seriously because it was not terribly difficult, but I didn’t really see a point in that. Not to toot my own horn here and turn this into a brag post, but I wanted to give some motivation to communicate with your professors and get friendly with them, they’re people too and will reward the students they see take them seriously.

Should I email my professor about a final grade ?,college,Two of the classes I took this semester were gateway courses and I need a B in both to continue the program.

The majority of the other highlighting comes from a single paragraph because of a list of symptoms/ medical conditions, which you cannot paraphrase, but I used an in-text citation. The teacher decided to give a “significant markdown” on the paper for plagiarism as it would have been “near perfect without it.” Knowing I did not intentionally plagiarize any work, I emailed her stating that the stuff that was highlighted by TurnItIn was generic phrasing and quotations and that none of my reflections were highlighted. My mistake here, I was referencing the reflections within the paper, but there were other class assignments called reflections. She replied back stating that I could fail the class and she could send me to the dean and that for the other reflections in the class (not my paper) were not turned in through TurnItIn and said, “I didn't use turnitin on your reflections as that should be only your ideas and thoughts... are you telling me you plagiarized all semester? Should I run all your work through turnitin? What will I find?” I am upset to be accused of plagiarism and do not want to get in trouble for something I did not do. If there was accidental plagiarism, in one sentence of the paper, I am confused as to why it was not mentioned by the teacher earlier as she had read multiple drafts of my work and not said anything about it before. I would be very grateful for any advice and more than willing to share the similarity report from TurnItIn to get insight from another person. I do not want to be accused for intentionally plagiarizing when that was not my intention to do so. Thank you! &#x200B; **UPDATE: Thank you all for your advice! I ended up not speaking with professor face to face as we were able to resolve over email. She raised my grade as she looked through to see that all but one sentence was original work. She did take 10% off as a warning that some professors will not be as lenient, but she recognized that the TurnItIn similarity percentage was mostly incorrect and that the one sentence was unintentional and difficult to paraphrase. As** u/JLaw_GIF_Bot **said, DOUBLE CHECK BECAUSE IT IS INCREDIBLY EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY PLAGIARIZE and DO NOT ALWAYS TRUST TURNITIN. Both lessons were learned by the professor and myself. You might not be so lucky to have an understanding professor. That said, I would likely not have been in this situation had it not been for the original high percentage from TurnItIn, but it was better to learn this lesson now where ignorance is still an accepted excuse than down the road where I cannot afford a 10% markdown or an F.

What do most of your classes curve to?,college,"At UW we don't get letter grades, but instead get graded on a 4.0 scale for every class. Hitting average in chem, for example, will give you a 2.8(+/-.2) for that class, while in math I think it's like 2.6(+/-.2), so doing average in all your classes will usually land you ~2.7 overall GPA. I've always thought this is pretty low (especially since you can score like ~85 on all exams and still get a low 3), so I'm just curious as to what others' experiences are with curves.

Undecided Between Majors,college,"Hello all, I am currently a Mathematics Major who loves Calculus and other types of calculations based classes. I initially picked Mathematics because I loved math throughout grade school and only got straight A’s in maths, and the average salary is pretty high. However, I came across this article titled “should you be a math major”. To summarize it, if you only like calculating stuff and solving equations, and are not really interested in proofs, then you should not be a Mathematics major. This stood out to me because that is exactly me. I have absolutely no interest in proofs and theorems. As a kid, I also really enjoyed building things out of paper and pretending they were iPhones, gaming consoles, etc. So I thought about taking an engineering class in high school, but because the school always screwed up my schedule, I couldn’t join one. Recently I’ve been thinking about whether I will truly be happy with a job in mathematics, as they all sound kinda boring (teaching, actuary, data analysis), but the only thing that stands out is the salary for actuaries. I’ve been wondering whether I should consider switching to engineering or not, and what type of engineering? Can someone please suggest a good type of engineering for someone like me who enjoys building small/medium sized objects and machinery. Also, I’m good at Chemistry and Physics, but hate Biology.

Science and health is definitely my passion and something I want to pursue, but having a nice income is also important to me. I've been looking at my schedule for Spring semester and am considering changing my classes. Idk if I want to pursue a psychology major anymore- I don't think I want to do research in psychology (more interested in things like studying different diseases/developing medication for treatment). I only took on this major because I found my psych classes interesting and thought having a double major would look better than just biology. People have told my a bio major is pointless if you're not premed. I feel like bioinformatics is an interesting major and has a good job market.

How exactly do I go about getting into grad school?,college,"I honestly stumbled my way into college on my own. I knew that my main goal was to major in computer science but that was about it. I didn't really have any guidance other than my guidance counselor in high school because nobody in my family or friends had ever attended college. When I talk to my advisors at my University it seems they'd rather me leave their office quicker then get me to understand what exactly I'm striving for. Essentially I currently am a junior but still have until fall of 2020 to make an impact somewhere, which is when I would expectedly get my bachelor's degree. Maybe later if needed. I only have an overall GPA of 3.2 up from 2.98 from last semester. My major GPA is a 3.0, up from a 2.61 from last semester. To get admitted into the accelerated program for getting a masters degree, I would have to have an overall of 3.3 and a major GPA of 3.5. Ideally I would have these GPAs by Spring of 2020 so I can get admitted in time. I believe these are achievable as long as I kick my behind like I did this semester. However, I'm not too sure if that's all I have to do. One thing I've never really understood was internships and research opportunities. Say if I wanted to continue on and get my doctoral degree or just be a better candidate for this accelerated Masters program. Maybe even go somewhere else afterwards. How exactly do I go about getting research opportunities or interning somewhere? Wouldn't those extend my expected graduation date?

Is it okay to give a professor a gift? What would you even give them?,college,"For a probability and statistics course this semester, my professor was absolutely incredible. I was pretty much on the road to failing the class. It was the day before the 2nd exam that I finally approached him and was honest about my situation. I wasn't studying enough, but finally wanted to step up my game and asked for help or suggestions with doing that. At that point, he could've simply told me that I should've came sooner and I wouldn't have blamed him. But from then on, he helped me a lot with studying for the class and I consistently got mid 80s on exam 2 and 3 and am set to probably pass the class with a low to mid B, if I do decent on the final. But if he didn't provide substantial extra help, I would probably have failed this class. Before we all go away on holiday, I wanted to give him some sort of gift to show my appreciation for everything he's done. I never did that before or even thought of doing it until now, but I think that he really did so much that I should do something. I already thanked him a lot throughout the semester, but what would you give as a gift to a professor? I don't know much about him other than that he's younger (hard to say exactly, I'd say 30s maybe).

A Brief Breakdown of what has been an Utterly Disastourous First Semester at University,college," So, I attend a good university in the UK. Top 1% in the world. I found my last year's in high school easy enough and managed to get into this good uni. Now, I have never had a good work ethic and am a serial procrastinator; this along with the fact that I have become a mild alcoholic, has meant that, on an purely academic level, my first semester has been incredibly poor. I started with 6 modules, I now do 5 (dropped one), am certainly going to fail one, will probably pass 1 and the other 3 are on dodgy ground. I have attended around 20% of lectures. Around 35% (give or take) of my seminars/tutorials and have got my first exam on Tuesday, which I have not opened a book for. I have consistently put off essay after essay and have even gone to less than digniful lengths to get extensions. I hand my essays in two weeks late (-4 grades) just before the last deadline for acceptance is. For some essays, I just straight up didn't hand them in. I wasted my student loan, nearly £2000 all in all, on expensive food, clothes and lots of alcohol, all within the space of less than a month. I understand my problem is procrastination, but I just can stop being lazy. I am undisciplined. I guess this is more venting than anything, but has anyone else been in this situation?

I have Caucasian features and I don’t dress like the rest of the girls. I also come from a well off family and this is why I stand out giving my teachers a reason to pick on me. I need 80% attendance in all of my courses otherwise I won’t be able to take the final exam and this has happened to me because one teacher didn’t like the way I dressed and because I am used to talking in English and prefer talking in it in formal situations. I am expected to spend 8-9 hours on campus where teachers don’t even show up sometimes and don’t give a notice. There’s no place for me to relax the campus is awful looks like a mad max movie there even if I am spending 8-9 hours there. It’s all very counter-productive and I don’t even get winter break as of now I have New Year’s plans and I have two exams the next day. I also have been severely depressed because I’ve had a really traumatic experience recently and it’s really hard for me to wake up for classes and the teachers are not willing to compromise at all. I like what I’m studying but I don’t get to study it at all they expect me to memorize everything word to word and if I don’t do that then I don’t get a decent grade. My program is literally based on analysis where there’s no right or wrong answer and requires a lot of critical thinking (I’ve asked people in other countries) and there’s absolutely no incentive for me to actually go there because I feel like I learn nothing I’m dead in class and I’m dead when I get home because I’ve spent an entire day with no heating in the winter and no air conditioning in the summer. I get excited about lying down in bed when classes are over I can’t stay physically active because I barely get time since I have to stay there from 8am to 4pm. Now my attendance is low and although I have a medical certificate I have to personally beg every teacher to let me take the exam and no there’s no higher authority they’re just as bad so I can’t ask any superiors to help and they don’t care about this at all. I have 4 classes every day or more the teachers don’t follow a timetable they just randomly show decide when they wanna schedule a class. I hate it so much and I know it’s too late to transfer and I’m actually too dead inside and lazy to do it now and my gpa is 2.7 or something. I don’t know what to do anymore. My classmates are perfectly fine with everything since they don’t have a life outside of university and being on campus is the best thing ever for them so no one else supports me on this. I can’t let my gpa drop even lower I’m just so scared and panicking about what will happen. Also this one teacher kicked me out of class for yawning and then the next day he kicked me out for looking away for 5 seconds. I don’t know if this sounds like a spoiled brat whining because that’s what my classmates tell me so just let me know if I’m overreacting or if this is actually bad I can’t decide anymore. TL;DR I whine about what it’s like to study in a third world university ,ab1kpd,self.college,,True

"Can breeze through STEM subjects, but struggle with subjects that involve a lot of reading/writing",college,"Is anyone else able to relate to this? I'm quite happy for myself that I'm able to excel in STEM subjects since I'm a CS major, but when it comes to classes that involve a lot of reading and writing (Intro courses in Anthropology, Philosophy), the assignments require much more time and energy for me to do well on them and this is somewhat worrisome to me. Nonetheless I've performed very well in both courses according to my grades (Both A's) and feedback from the professors (My philosophy professor acknowledges that my papers are really good). I'm currently taking 12 credits worth of STEM and 6 credits worth of reading/writing. All the assignments in the STEM courses combined take me the same time to complete as the ones in the 6 credits of reading/writing involved classes. Thankfully I recognize the value in these kinds of courses and I really put in the effort I need to succeed there. The good news for me is that after this semester, it's all STEM the rest of the way for the most part as my genEds are out of the way. However I still worry how this may affect me in the future, especially in the professional world. I can do calculus in a breeze but will often struggle to read a paragraph from a book.

Or go through a trade program at my local community college (offers trades such as aerospace manufacturing) and make a decent income (my Friend went through the program and he claims to comfortably be making around $50-60k with employment.)

I'm pretty sure an associate's would be classed as a diploma here given how Europe treats them and  is the frustrating percentage bar chart which indicates what NZ's college pupils do after they've finished. Notice the further complication that school year in the southern hemisphere tends to follow the calendar whereas in the Northern hemisphere it's half in and half out of two separate years, which means there's no consistent interpretation of annual figures in terms of responsiveness to shared phenomena (e.g. the GFC if I wanted to go back that far; not that NZ's GFC was remotely similar to the USA's).

Even more frustrating is that I outscored them on the SAT, and I only have a 3.5 GPA. My question is, do colleges even care?

Anything i can do about a final which the entire class failed?,college,"Im currently in precalc and have maintained pretty much a perfect grade. Going into the final i had a 104%. Much of the class also had very good grades. The final was weighted as 40% of our total grade and we all assumed it would be similar to the rest of the semester. Wrong. The final contained over 50% material which we never covered throughout the semester. The final was open book/note and the concepts were no where to be found. After the class we all got together to discuss what in the hell happened. The entire class pretty much failed, and we have no idea what to do from here. This wasnt due to a lack of understanding or preperation. We literally were not given the informatin needed to do remotely well. Do i have any options?

Retaliation for FERPA complaint,college,"I had a professor violate FERPA this semester. She addressed me and a classmate in the same email about our disability support and ADA accommodations. To make matters worse, the two options she outlined for our exam violated our accommodations and put us at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the class. This woman has harassed me all semester too. It’s been a nightmare tbh. This issue led to her completely violating my accommodations for the final exam, I’ll get to that in a minute. I addressed the privacy issue and inadequate accommodations. Both were ignored until I told them I was filing a federal complaint for the FERPA violation. When they finally responded to my emails, they minimized everything and offered us a 3rd option that didn’t disadvantage us. Now, final exam time. I contacted disability support to take it in the testing center like I usually do. They told me they didn’t have the right software in order for me to take it there. I expressed concern about faculty being able to accommodate me and was assured that I would have a reduced distraction testing environment. The Professor emailed me 2 hours prior to the exam. She outlined 2 options, both options were basically INCREASED distraction. I’ve learned to advocate for myself so I let her know how I felt about the options. I was basically told, too bad, they claimed this was the BEST they could do for me. Whatever. So, I just took my final with everyone else without accommodations. It was seriously the most distracting environment I’ve ever tested in. A classmate and good friend of mine didn’t show up for the FINAL. They have failed people for not showing up. This was completely out of character for my friend. She NEVER misses class so I figured something terrible must’ve happened. Well, she was safe, thankfully. She completely forgot we had our final and was “shopping”. The Professor allowed her to take her final 2 days later. One on one, just herself and a proctor in an empty classroom. I’m glad they didn’t fail her because I would be miserable without my friend there but damn, how are they going to accommodate someone forgetting but not accommodate my disability? This is one of many things that have happened this semester. Last semester I had a professor give me a zero on a group project and had to get upper administration to intervene on my behalf because they refused to give me credit or return any emails and I legitimately earned the points.

In which ways will Phi Theta Kappa help me? What’s the likelihood of me getting a scholarship?,college,"I recently just joined the honor society Phi Theta Kappa. I was debating joining over the past year because I wasn’t sure that it would benefit me too much. One thing that led me to join was putting it on a resume for employers. The school I’m transferring to in the fall does an Accounting night every year where different businesses accept applications for interns. I wanted to have something else on my resume aside from good grades in school and work. So this was the main reason I joined, to have a competitive edge when applying for internships and jobs. I am also aware of scholarships that you can receive upon transferring through PTK. I researched a little bit on the scholarships and other students experiences which showed people have different experiences. I noticed there are a lot of scholarships that depend on not only your academic achievements, but also with your involvement with the organization. This is where I was conflicted to join. I don’t have the time to devote to partaking in events with my chapter, as I go to school full time and work as well. This narrows my window of scholarships down to the ones that are focused on academic achievement. I currently have a 3.83 GPA with one more semester before transferring. I expect that my GPA will stay around the same with either increasing slightly or slightly decreasing this semester. My question is, do you think I would receive a scholarship with my GPA? This is where I’m worried because I know PTK offers a lot of invitations, but have limited scholarships. I saw that you could look up the school in which you are transferring to see what they offer PTK members. The school I’m transferring to said $2,500. Is that a guaranteed scholarship that one would receive or what may or may not receive? I would like to hear from other PTK members who have gone through the transferring process. Ideally ones who weren’t extremely active in their chapter. I am currently already accepted to a University through a transfer program in which I will receive a 30% tuition discount for maintaining a GPA above 3.50. So getting into a school isn’t my worry, but rather driving the cost of tuition down is. Ideally I’d like to pay tuition out of pocket and not take out a loan upon transfer. Nonetheless, I still think joining will be beneficial for resume building. Please give your input on my situation and let me know how your experience with scholarships and transferring went with Phi Theta Kappa. ",ab2g86,self.college,,True

Academic Suspension Appeal Letter,college,"So, here's my letter! I need someone to review it and tell me what I need to change. &#x200B; Greetings and Salutations, My name is XXXXXXXXX and I am writing this letter to explain the situations leading up to my academic warning, probation, and suspension. I have been having undiagnosed health-problems that have impacted my ability to perform in my classes. During the Fall/Spring semester of my freshmen year at XXXXXX University, I begin to experience health complications. I had intense pains that immobilized me to the point where I could not go to my classes somedays and the stress on my body caused my eczema and psoriasis to flare up intensely. Despite all of this my happening my Freshmen year, I still tried my best to go to my classes—no matter how much pain I was in, I did try. I was not able to schedule doctor appointments for quite awhile due to not having insurance almost a year now. I sprained my ankle on September 19, 2018 and this also made it hard for me to get to my classes due to it having to heal in six-weeks but traversing up and down the hills to go to my class caused it to swell up and delay the healing process. I recently went to the ER after having severe pelvic pain and discovered that it is due to having undiagnosed Polycystic Ovary Syndrome—this causes cyst to form on my ovaries. When those cyst pop, I experience an unimaginable pain and it worsens the more it gets untreated. The ARNP at the ER told me she was going to refer me to my primary doctor and an OBGYN to look for a tumor as well. Both my mother and I are scheduling doctor appointments for next month so that I can get treated for my PCOS and to figure out whether I have a tumor as well. I kept going to classes and coming back to the university these past two years, because I was taught to do the best that I can because no one else would do it for me. Despite the health-issues I have had to deal with while attending the university and not being able to perform as I normally would have, I did try to do what I could. I know that if I can return to the university for the Spring 2019 semester and since I have insurance to be able to see specialist for my condition, I will give my best efforts as my health gets better. I have a concrete plan that I will follow as well: **1)** **I will purchase another Academic Calender to remind myself to turn in ALL assignments early** **2)** **I will create a study chart as well** **3)** **I will communicate more with my Advisor and professors regarding my health-issues.** **4)** **I will utilize the tutoring services and study groups on campus more to ensure I understand concepts/information in classes** **5)** **I will communicate much better with my academic advisor to ensure I get back on track to graduation** Please take this personal statement and the one from my primary physician into consideration when you make your decision.

I realize this is very passive aggressive, but I need help on confrontation! In addition to this, she has a boyfriend who comes over all the time. She cooks for him and they sit in the kitchen or watch something on the couch, like normal people. But he sleeps over maybe 4 out of 7 nights a week. And snores. So. Fucking. Loud. To the point where I don’t want to sleep in in the morning on weekends (and I barely get enough sleep as it is). And particularly when he sleeps over and sometimes I spend the night somewhere else, I come back to the room and it smells like the worst human funk. I won’t explain it in detail but you get the picture—it smells like two warm bodies laying in their stank after fucking. And here’s where it’s getting a little weird. My roommate is also bisexual, and beginning of our freshman year, when we both had boyfriends, we all went to a party and made out in exchange for our boyfriends making out. My boyfriend at the time warned me that she seemed a little too thirsty for me. I brushed it off thinking he was being paranoid or trying to mess with me. At another party again, with these boyfriends, she kissed me 3 times, according to my boyfriend of the time (I was drunk so my memory of events the next day was not the best). Since then she has continued to do weird stuff, such as always asking me to shotgun when we smoke, giving me extra long looks when I’m talking to her in the room wearing a shirt without a bra on, and being a little too inclusive of me with her boyfriend. For example, if I’m in the apartment, they tend to follow me to whatever room I’m in or butt into my conversations on the phone. I wanted to be her friend up until about a month ago, and maybe I let some of this weird behavior slide even though I shouldn’t have. Recently, I have been decidedly setting more boundaries and not hanging out as much. But is this a healthy living situation? I love my room so much and it was my idea to live in this residence hall, and I just feel like since I’m not the one causing trouble, why should i have to move out? I just need a sounding board for moving out, not moving out, or what other options could be.",a2fbwz,self.college,,True
I'm a First Semester student and I need advice,college,"I am a first semester student at a community college. I am 18 and started the semester out taking 5 classes that totaled 13 credits and ended up dropping one class (History) and failing both Math and College Success Skills. My GPA is 1.9. The counselors say I can retake the classes and make my GPA better, but I that doesn't make me feel better. I feel very depressed and I don't really want to be in college. My parents are making me attend college. I feel like I should have taken a semester or a year off so I could have found myself and my passions instead of going straight from high school to college without a solid plan. I don't even know what I'm going to do out of college or what I want to major in. I was kind of forced into this. I'm thinking of possibly taking less credits per semester to lessen my workload even if that means I will be here longer. Can someone give me advice on what I should do? Is it normal to have a low GPA first semester? Is it normal to take less credits per semester to lessen the workload? Is it normal to not know what you want to do as a first semester college student?

Is it worth it to change my major just so I can be done with undergrad?,college,"I am about to start my 14th quarter of undergrad (winter term of my fifth year) and have earned 209 credit hours total. Which is a lot. Yet I still have not met all requirements to graduate in my department. My major is Earth Sciences (basically Geology) with a track focus in Geophysics. I've been struggling with finishing the last few requirements for the degree due to some financial and some mental health issues I've been having since this summer (those are mostly under control, I've started seeing a counselor regularly.) There are no major components missing in my degree audit just a few elective credits (8 total) here and there that I have not completed. The problem is these electives aren't being offered right now. The other problem is that I am no longer living on campus, or even in town. I planned to finish the requirements online, but there was a miscommunication and the online elective I DID sign up for, and it won't actually count. I could apply to have some requirements waived, and to have some electives fill in for other requirements, but my advisor told me it's a gamble if whether or not the department will allow it. I did some digging and found out I actually have completed ALL of the requirements for a General Science B.S. AND a minor in Earth Sciences. Right now. I can be done tomorrow. I want to email my advisor to ask about the possibility of changing major and then immediately applying to graduate, but I'm not sure how that comes across to the department and my professors. To be honest I have no real desire to be a professional geologist anymore. I've been shadowing a family friend who is a professional geologist but works with our State Forestry department and he has been offering me internship and job opportunities that can start as soon as I finish my undergrad. Is it a bad move to change to a General Science major with only a Geology minor? It seems kind of shallow. Graduate school is not on my immediate radar but I may consider it in the future. For now I just really want to be finished and have something to show for my 4.5 years of college and thousands of dollars of debt. **The bottom line is this:** I am completely exhausted with college. I have over 200 credits at a university where the average requirement for an undergraduate degree is around 160. I have the opportunity to change my major to something that is still somewhat related, and keep my existing major as a minor, and be completely *done.* Meanwhile if I stick with my current major there is no guarantee they will allow me to graduate this term. And PLUS I would still have several online classes to do this winter. Should I change? ",aah6nc,self.college,,True

I need some advice on picking a degree that is right for me.,college,"A quick disclaimer: this is my first time posting on Reddit, so I apologize if this is an ugly wall of text! So a little bit of backstory before I get to the question, I'm 24 years old, happily married and have two great kids. I joined the Army almost 4 years ago to provide a good life for my family and to build some sort of career. The military gave me the training and college credits relevant to my job, which is a certification and an Associate's degree to be a medical laboratory technician. That said, I don't enjoy the military or being a lab technician enough to make them lifelong careers; I basically joined to make better money and get my foot in the door of some more fulfilling work, and my plan A is to continue my education towards something else, get out of the Army in a year, work as a lab technician until I finish my degree and continue from there. I consider job fulfillment very important. Working a job I hate just to bring home money is just a means to an end for me. I consider myself a creative person and being able to express those things is part of my identity and I'm basically not sure how to set myself up for such a job with regards to using the free college the Army offers me wisely. My interests are like this: I love video games and music. So much that it hurts. My dream job would be working as part of a team or directing a team to work on either the art or the music for a video game. I don't quite understand the fundamentals of art, but I have a little bit of skill built up over the years, and the same with music. I've been mostly making music for fun since like 2010 with some digital drawing on the side to compliment my music. I'm also a bit of a people person and I think I would enjoy leading projects of my own with a team. In that way, I want to create something from the heart and allow others to do something that they love to in a work environment that actually makes them want to come to work. &#x200B; At the moment, I have almost all of my gen ed classes out of the way and unless I change my plan, will start working on upper classes for a Bachelor's in business admin with a concentration in information systems. I chose this degree because I had a really hard time deciding what to study and thought business was broad enough to apply anywhere and by studying info systems (lots of computer/coding classes), working on side projects along the way, one day I could be part of a team while the business degree keeps a roof over our heads. I figured since I like making people happy, maybe I could manage a team and spread my philosophy of happiness around, I would love to create an environment to work in that people are excited to be part of. I had considered going to school for video game design, but read that I could be pigeonholing myself and that experience/a portfolio would be just as important as a degree. I also considered an art/design/animation degree, but similarly, I worry if it is really worth my time to get a degree in something I theoretically could learn without college. I'm a very driven person and workaholic, I never stop moving and learning, I just have crippling indecisiveness that has me spreading all of my time and effort into so many uncertain directions. People of the internet, what advice do you have for someone in my situation? I have a family to take care of, but I must express my playful heart or risk horrible sadness and resentment. I can't imagine staying in the military any longer than I have to (14 more months). It is the absolute opposite environment from the one I want to be in. I don't mind lab work, but it is just a means to an end. I don't fit into the military lifestyle, it causes so much anxiety in me and I have to find a happier way to make decent money.

Europe, by comparison, seems to have a pretty vast quantity of War Strategic Studies masters programs, as well as a few doctorate programs. But here in the states there seems to be almost nothing.

Any advice on how to pay for life and school?,college,"I started college in 2016 attending a federal maritime academy, studying marine systems engineering. After some time there I decided to come home to attend a traditional school and study a different brand of engineering. Unfortunately, very little of the credits from my first school transfer as they were on the trimester system rather than the semester system. Essentially, I am starting at the very beginning of my curriculum, as if I were a new freshman. Currently, I am working full time (8-5) to pay for rent and to have enough money for general cost of living. I wasn't able to register this fall as I arrived here at an odd time in the semester. I also forgave my in-state lottery scholarship when I left state to attend my first school, so I have to pay full in-state tuition. I guess my question comes down to: Should I take out a large loan to pay for school full time and work to keep my head above water with my bills? I really don't want to get trapped working full time and never finish school and follow my dreams. Might X-Post on some other subs later. Just looking for advice.

Can I Make a Post To Brag? I've Never Had Success In Any Kind Of School Environment Until These Past 2 Years,college,"So I am a high school drop out. I dropped out junior year after getting kicked out of private school for low grades, and then started attending public school to finish Junior year, but was so depressed I just gave up and took my GED. I thought maybe I should go into community college right after dropping out so I did, for two semesters, in which I left with a 0.0 gpa (no, thats not a typo). I dropped of course and then I eventually found a great job to get me started out in life. A restaurant job. I started out at the bottom working part time as a host, and over several years worked my way into part time management and bartending. I was fed up with it though at that point. I didn't want to spend my 20s working in a restaurant and then getting drunk at the bar next door. I wanted to do something and have a more predictable career (also wanted to get as far away from an ex gf but thats a different story for another time). I moved back in with my parents and started attending community college again. I chose Computer Information Technology w/ concentration on programming. It's not a traditional CS, It's more like a bootcamp, but with accreditation and my credits will transfer to most in state universities. My first semester was... average. I passed and that was just a big enough milestone as it is. My next semester was my first successful semester. I didn't get below a B. From then I knew I could do this, and started taking school very seriously The following semesters till now I've taken rigorous schedules in order to repair my GPA. As of now, my GPA stands at a 2.97, and if my last class I'm waiting on ends up being an A (Which it should be) I'll break the 3.00 threshold, the highest GPA I've ever held in school ever. But even better news, I just received my first internship offer! I'll be interning at a company I've always dreamed of working at. I'll be doing software development. The company is no google or facebook, but you've heard of them. It's been a journey and a half. I have one more semester plus this internship and I can make the decision to transfer to a 4 year (already accepted to the school I want to go too) or start with full time employment. I'm leaning more towards FTE as it is right now as I really need to get working. But just having these options in my life is just amazing. ",a5wksy,self.college,,True

Student Loans...,college,"I am wanting to educate teenagers whom are nearing the age that the majority of students go to college about the effects of student loans on their future. Student loans are a horrific way to pay for college. But let’s start off by saying this: \- If you don’t know what to do with your life, DO NOT go to college. This can be a severe waste of money and you may spend way more money than necessary to find an adequate field to study in. With that in mind, so, you’re ready for college ? How are you going to pay? Not everyone is fortunate enough to have parents that can afford to pay their ways through college. The typical student responds with “ loans”. WRONG. Do not do this. As of 2018, the current outstanding student loan debt totals $1.5 trillion USD. With over 70% of college students graduating with significant student loan debt. This means TODAY, 1 in 4 American adults are paying off their student loans! \- So now you may ask, “ well, what’s the answer ?” Of course there is no easy answer here. Often times family has placed great pressure on their children that they must go to college to be successful in life. But in the end, it is your life. If college isn’t for you and you don’t want to study anything and drop tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars on an education unnecessary to your future, then don’t! Because in the end, YOU are the pilot of your life. Many people are successful in life with side hustles/ businesses of their own or attain well-paying jobs without degrees. \- Still want to go to college? Know what you need to study? Great. The easiest way to pay cash for college is to either A.) Apply for as MANY scholarships you can. B.) Fill our FAFSA and try your best to find grants applicable to you C.) Work part-time job(s) or a full-time job during college to pay college as you go along. D.) Save up for a few years until you believe you have significant enough funds to pay for college. \- But Seems pretty simple, right ? Well it really is! Now it is simple, not EASY. But nothing worth having comes easy. Living a debt-free life is the best decision you can make this early in your life. Meaning every dollar you earn goes to YOU. \- If you have any comments, suggestions, or criticism on this matter, please message back in this group! :)",a51j7w,self.college,,True

Considering a change from Kinesiology to Computer Science. I have some fears and some questions.,college,"Good evening, UPDATE: I've decided not to switch majors. Thanks for all the help! I hope all is going really well for anyone else preparing for their final exams. However I'm more than stressed for my finals. So over the last few weeks, I've been reflecting on my classes and what I enjoyed, and I've found that the subject matter was mostly just, okay, and anatomy and physiology was painful with the amount of stuff we needed to memorize. The only part I've really enjoyed was the Biochemistry part (ATP, Propogation of Nerve Impulses, etc.) I've been reading more into tech, and I've noticed that I have really taken a liking to (at least the description) of most of the classes in CS, and they look really interesting. I also dream of working in Europe and settling down there, and CS seems to be the best avenue. But I have some major fears that I need to address. 1. Math. Math has never really been my strong suit. But it's been really hard to pin point if I'm bad at it, or what. In High School when I had a teacher than clicked and helped explain I got 81 or 78% (Grade 9 and 11 respectively). But when I did Grade 10 and 12 math I found that the concepts just went way over my head, and I struggled to keep my head above water. (63% in Advanced Functions). Stuff like Trigonometry I cannot understand for the absolute life of me. the whole sin^2 (cos-tan/2)= 1/cos stuff never ever clicked. I have also never taken Calculus, as it was not a required high school class, and I didn't need it for my current major. I'm worried I will be way way way too much of a lost cause to ever succeed in University math. 2) My GPA. This one is much shorter haha. I'm worried about tanking my GPA by taking these classes, and I will lose out on any opportunity to pursue say an MSc if I wanted to. 3) Wasting money/Graduating Late This one is the most morally hurting. My parents pay for my tuition and it is not cheap. I am scared that my whole 1st year, 20 000$ will go down the drain, and my parents will be absolutely devastated. I also doubt I would be able to graduate in 4 years, meaning that the economic burden on my parents is much worse. Anyhow. Thanks for hearing me out.",a28v4u,self.college,,True

"Students who take notes on an iPad, is it worth it / how does this change your study methods?",college,"I am considering purchasing an iPad and Apple Pencil as my main note taking interface. I am a chemistry major, and also work with my schools disability services as a note taker for my chemistry classes. The problem with this is I like my notes to look a different way and some of the students I work for want additional information / different layouts within my notes. I am very particular about how I take my own notes so the idea of being able to edit them down accordingly once my notes are sent off is a very appealing feature. However, I feel like I study best with a physical copy of my notes in front of me, I do not like studying from a screen. Does anyone take their notes by hand digitally, and then print them and file accordingly? If so what system do you use to keep your notes (i.e. binder, disc bound notebook system, etc). I feel like it’s very important for me to have tangible notes readily available, especially on topics I will be possibly readdressing later on in grad school my non major courses, I feel I maybe don’t need hard copies of as the classes I take are within the arts and don’t rely heavily on test taking vs. my STEM ones. Does anyone have experience with this? I feel like taking notes in this way will allow me to be better organized, however is it worth the hassle to have both digital and hard copies of my notes?

Please cite your sources!,college,"I teach a couple of master's level courses a semester in addition to my day job, and I sometimes have to give someone a zero on a final exam because of plagiarism. It gives me absolutely no joy to do so. I don't even use Turnitin to check for this stuff. I've read so many student answers that I *know* when you're copying from a source. A little red flag pops up in my brain, I copy a sentence and google it, and find it word for word. The thing is, you can copy from a source as long as you quote it and cite the source!!! But no quotes + no citation = plagiarism. I also sometimes would never guess the student who made the boneheaded choice - I grade with usernames off, and was shocked this last time when I saw to whom I had given a zero. Normally the student is outstanding, and in fact the student's excellent homework average saved the student's final grade from being a F. The saddest part, for me, is when I tell a student for whom I had previously been a professional reference that I can't serve in that role any more, because my ability to be unreservedly enthusiastic is obviously compromised.

Why did you choose your major? What really drew you to it and are you happy you chose it?,college,"I'm a physics graduate and I'm currently in grad school for physics. Physics was always a passion of mine but it was a bit of journey before obtaining it. I wanted to be a physicist when I first got into college, but because of pressure that I would never find a job and I was learning 'fun' science and not applicable science I started out as an aerospace engineer. I always wanted to work at NASA and be in the space industry and was told that was the way to go, but it never felt right. Aerospace was fine, but there was always this gnawing feeling in the back of my mind that I was doing it because other people told me to and not because I wanted to. I wanted to learn how the universe and everything worked, not just simply learn science to apply it. After a few years in aerospace I took a major risk and completely changed my major into physics. To me the gnawing feeling was too much and I knew I only had one life so might as well live it a bit risky. I think of college into two completely different phases. Pre physics and post physics. Pre physics I was partying a lot, drinking a lot, it almost was like I was wandering and searching for this fulfilling feeling I deeply wanted. When I switched to physics, I was locked in, I was focused and working towards to it felt very natural. It almost felt seamless, just giving myself into it, because this is what I always wanted to do, what I always dreamed of doing. Even though the first 3 years of my college experience looked more fun on the surface, whenever I think of my happiest memories, I think of the last 3, because in a way I found myself through those last 3 and was able to be the person I always wanted to be. Many times during my physics major I had thoughts on whether I should have stuck with aerospace or went with computer science. I knew going that route would land me with less debt, more money, and more security, but looking back, I don't regret anything. I don't think I could be happy unless I chose the path that I chose and struggled and went through it all. It also worked out because I'm currently doing research for a NASA contractor working in plasma physics. I'm still able to be a physicist and learn how the universe works and also use my skills for space like I always wanted. &#x200B; Anyway why did you all choose your major and what did it mean to you?

How much is too much homework in finals week?,college,"I've been taking a brutal class this semester, and even though it's the only one I'm taking right now and the temp job I was working ended over a month ago, it's still taking up most of my time. The final, cumulative exam is in a little over a week, and the professor has assigned around twice as much homework and reading material as he's done on a usual week, with most of it due two days before the day of the exam. I don't understand how I can be expected to do all this homework and still have enough time to study for the final. and I really need to study for it. This is an online only class, and I learned a month ago that some students have been warned against taking this professor's class (the class specifically, not the same course taught by other instructors). I usually finish a class with at least an A-, and I need to keep my grades at this level since I'm trying to apply to some grad programs. But for this class I've gotten an F on every test we've taken so far. I've dedicated an unbelievable amount of time studying for each one, and each time I try to assess what I did wrong (hard to do when he never gives us back our tests) and I'm constantly at the tutoring lab asking for help on everything I'm unsure of. But each time my scores are relatively the same, and I'm not seeing where my effort is going. A friend says I should complain to the dean of students about stuff like this, but I don't see what that would accomplish, and I can't even find anything with that name at my college.",a2ian9,self.college,,True

How to deal with oversleep,college,"This is one of the problems that I thought wouldn't be a big problem but actually is. So I'm now in college and I occasionally oversleep some classes I don't care about, but I never oversleep the important class.. unless it's a 8 am class. But I havn't been worrying too much about it since skipping a few classes a term is pretty normal. Now I'm in a 3 week long internship-like program and this oversleep problem is really messing me up. I'm just in my 3rd week and I've already overslept twice. I usually go to sleep at around 12 and wake at 7:30. The first time was 'reasonable' since I went to bed at 1, so I woke up an hour later than usual. The second time, which is today, was just bad and I don't why it's happening. I went to bed at 12 and when I woke up it was fucking 9:45. I have 7 alarms from 7:05 to 8:00. I guess it could be that none of them went off, but I can't know for sure. Thankfully I'm not getting paid in this intern and I'm also not doing any actual work for the company, so my boss doesn't really care.

Ambiguous wording in Math problems,college,"A week or so ago I took a Trig test with a bearing problem that began like this: *Tower A is 3.9 miles apart from Tower B* Then it gave you the bearing of an object from Tower A and Tower B respectively, and asked you to solve for the distance to the object from each tower. Here’s the thing - the difficulty of this problem hinges on whether or not A and B are on a perfectly flat line. Since the problem didn’t explicitly say this was the case, I wasted way too much time trying to solve the problem as if A and B were not on the same exact level. Eventually I gave up and had to assume the opposite was true, I still wasn’t sure but I figured better safe than sorry.

In my opinion, this is enough to keep them away from vulnerable college students looking for salvation or a higher power in any form.

ADVICE: To dorm or not to dorm,college,"Hey friends, so basically I’m a senior in high school and I’m kind of stuck with a dilemma. I’m really debating on whether dorming in college is worth it.

Additionally, the college is only around 6 miles away, so that’s 12 miles per round trip. Meaning that, each time I would want to have some form of social interaction on top of going to class, I’d have to drive 12 miles each time.

Not sure what to major in?,college,"So I really do not enjoy that many subjects... I like math, physics, biology, and politics. That's it. I tried engineering for this past semester and I absolutely hated everything about it. It made me realize that I actually have 0 interest in designing products/systems or programming. I don't really know why I tried that major, I was never a computer buff, builder, or liked fixing stuff. All the other kids I encountered in engineering found that interesting while I always hated it. I think I find science more interesting than applied science. I'm not some prodigy in math or physics. I would rather just use math as a tool and be done with it. Biology is probably my strongest subject. I am not a people person at all. I can go weeks at a time barely interacting with anybody and be perfectly fine. If I had to do a job with constant social interaction, I would become very drained and angry quickly. I'm not charismatic and I'd say I have a pretty cut and dry personality. I have a really hard time seeing myself going into business. I changed my major to microbiology, but I don't know what the hell I'll do with it.

Should I be discouraged by a bad grade or was this the case of a shitty professor?,college,"I posted this in CSMajors but this sub has a bit of a larger following so it seemed appropriate I'm a first semester sophomore who just finished Data Structures and absolutely bombed the final worse than any test I've ever taken. I did good enough on the other two midterms (barely passed one and failed the other) and just barely passed the course. I admittedly am not as good as my peers with the material and I failed the final by significantly worse than most that I know of. However we never received any feedback on any work for two over months and almost the entire class' grades plummeted as well. In my intro to Java course I got a B+ and a B (narrowly missing out on an A- and a B+) and am Mostly straight A's in all of my other classes Should I reconsider my major, or is this more of a case of a shitty professor. Edit: should also mention but I got a perfect score on every lab except the very first, but the lab was mostly just copying and pasting his code, then rewriting it, then rewriting it using a generic class. They were very easy and I worked on it with Classmates, didn't understand them at first and was just copying off my peers, then I went to tutoring a tutoring session (tried to go regularly but the tutor only shows up when he feels like it) and it made so much sense. Edit 2: forgot to also mention that we had no review, we were supposed to have two days of review but the first he was unavailable and said he would give us an assignment to do on his absence (which he never posted) and then on the other day he went over the big O notation for 45 minutes despite saying beforehand it will not be on the test. Then reviewed recursion and linked lists for about 20 minutes. He also promised us that he would post many things throughout the semester when we asked such as source code, and he said yes but then never did, for everything he said would be post. Edit 3: so we got our grades today and he gave us our grades in these wild groups, me who got about a 69-70 in the class and the guy who received about a 58 both got a C and one person who average a 90 and another who averaged an 80 both received A's.

Not all professors are bad,college,"I’m a senior in college and usually do pretty well in school, although I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life and it got incredibly worse throughout college. I’m a prelaw major and have taken the LSAT twice. The normal range is 150-180. Both times I scored really low despite having high grades in my classes and being a good student. My LSAT scores have really discouraged me and I stopped showing up to my class (thanks depression) with a really strict professor. I actually was debating dropping out of college because since I’m not going to law school there’s no point in graduating and I’m not going to find a job. I haven’t been to my class in three weeks or turned in my homework, so I woke up to an email this morning from my professor saying “OP, You are an excellent student. You still can get a good grade for the class. But you must take the final to make this happen. Even if you don’t feel completely prepared, give it your best shot.” I started bawling and I went to his office immediately. He was luckily in there and I asked to talk because I didn’t want to be on bad terms and he said “you know, I’ve been thinking about you and I’m really worried”. We had a deep talk for 45 mins and I told him how I felt discouraged and like a failure and he was actually really encouraging and told me how I’m talented, only 3 people have A’s and I’m one of them and not to give up on law school, he can sense I’m a perfectionist and that I’m putting too much pressure on myself, etc and was acting as a therapist. I was crying the entire time bc he was being so genuine and he kept saying “I know you’re going to pass my class” and there’s not really a point to this but the whole interaction made me put things into perspective because he was really motivating and put things into perspective for me and didn’t act like a hardass professor and actually understood my problems. He also said “some of the most successful people have had bouts of depression” and that once I get out of this slump he knows I’ll be successful.

How knowledgeable were you right after getting your undergraduate diploma and how can a student get high levels of perfomance in this department?,college,"I'm on the end of my second semester and fear graduating knowing as much as when I first enrolled to my course. This is because university doesn't seem to really support our learning. In mine, we're asked to learn things, but that constitutes what university wants us to learn, which often mounts to only a fraction of the discipline's contents. We also can't counteract this, there's no time, which gives us two choices: 1) learning random facts with little meaningful understanding about them and passing exams; 2) trying to learn stuff well but failing to pass exams. As you see, none of them are that beneficial to our education. In my friend's university things are just as bad if not worse.

By far the weirdest email exchange with a professor yet,college,"Wed 12/5, 12:31 AM Dr. Professor, In regards to question 2 on Exam 3, could you please explain why choice **A. none of the above** is not correct? While Singer does suggest that the bakery owner hire outside of white employees albeit a temporary loss of profit, he does not claim that the bakery owner 'should be forced to hire black bakers.' No where in the piece is such claim made. However, Singer *does* say 'Yet it is surely too much to ask an individual shop-owner to risk his livelihood in a lone and probably vain effort to break down prejudice' in reference to the cake shop scenario. This directly opposes the notion that Singer believes the owner should be forced to hire blacks. If the wording of the answers wasn't so hazy, I would have obviously chosen choice **D. should be forced to hire black bakers, even if it means a temporary loss of profit** because it did touch on Singer's opinions. Ultimately, I decided against it because the inclusion of *'forced to'* did not match what was included in the book. I do hope you can see where I'm coming from and can understand my confusion with the situation.

I have to start thinking about what I can do in order to support myself. I know it's probably a good idea to get a job and start saving as much as possible before I begin the college application process, but I'm somewhat lost after that. My options are: 1) **Go to community college transfer to a 4-year.** This option doesn't sound too bad. I'd save money and I could also pick up a job to help with expenses when I transfer. However, I'm kind of in love with the idea of going to a four year college from the beginning but I don't think that's financially smart or possible. 2) **Take out loans and go to a 4 year, pay my debt off** I do not like the idea of loans. I'm trying to avoid them at all costs. Too many horror stories. 3) **Scholarships and figure out the rest as it comes** I live in Florida and as far as I know, I am elgliable for Bright Futures.

While I love my boyfriend, I’m worried that the college experience won’t be the same with him there. (Please note I did not apply to these colleges to escape him, but because they met my criteria) He said after seeing my college choices that he doesn’t agree with the people who say not to let love get in the way of college. I was already worried before this as while he trusts me, he wants to be around me anytime I do something that could lead to a typical cheating story. I just want to be able to live on a campus I love, and be apart of the activities without being worried that he’ll be upset that I did them without him, or even at all. Does anyone who was in a long term relationship have advice based off of their experience either pursuing it or ending things before they crumble? Edit: When I say “typical cheating situations” I don’t mean he thinks that I’ll cheat, but just doesn’t like situations that I’m not in my right mind or around people who aren’t in theirs without him. This hasn’t been a problem thus far because we live close, but I’m worried if I go to a school that’s a bit farther, he will become more protective of what I do to compensate.

Help Picking A Major?,college,"Hello to this sub. I am a high school senior who has been accepted to a good college which offers quite a few options, and I'm wondering what to do. I need a major which offers me good job prospects and one I don't hate. I have a list of majors I'm considering. Things I've thought about as Potential Majors: -Environmental Science: I really enjoyed this class in HS, and like the stuff I learned about. However, I've heard it's quite broad, and that if I'm interested in this, I have to specialize more. Those who pursued this major, what are your experiences? Do you wish you decided to specialize in forestry or something along those lines? If so, what's the best thing to specialize in? -Genetics/Biology: The college I got into offers this, and I put it down for my intended major. I am interested in some sort of science and the science of how genes impact biology is really interesting to me. However, i worry that it's too specialized and that I'll have issues finding jobs. Those with experience in this, Do you wish you had pursued something more general like biology? Or maybe even biotech might be better? -Animal Science (Eventual Vet): I think that this would be fun to study, and it would lead me to becoming a vet, if I decided to go along that route. However, I've heard getting into vet school from undergrad is hard, and I've heard mixed things about being a vet. Any vets/animal science majors, is it worth it? -Some sort of art: One of my major skills is art. Although I don't think I'd choose this as a major, would it hurt to make this a minor or double major? Although I know engineering is very good, math has not been a strong suite. Although if I grind enough I can get through it (for through AP Calc AB and got a 4 on the exam), I don't think I would be able to get through all the math in college.

"Someone keeps going to the bathroom around the dorm and they haven’t been caught, help!",college,"This is mostly just a story but me looking for some advice on how we can catch this rogue shitter. Towards the start of the semester the RAs in my dorm were shocked to find someone had shit in the sink in one of the girl’s bathrooms; though gross, not much was thought of it, knocking it up to just a one off incident. A week or so passed and yet again someone discovered a nice pile in the same exact sink. This continued until the end of the semester. One time it was in the floor. Another inside a shirt that was then placed into the sink. No one knew who it was, theories were thrown out and fingers pointed but no definitive answer was found. After the fifth time, the RD declared that no guests would be allowed overnight (though lets be honest, someone who shits in a sink probably doesn’t have too many friends), both as punishment and to try and figure out if it was an inside job. Come to find out, it was/still is, most likely. We had a moment of peace, three weeks with no shit. The guest ban was lifted and life continued on. As finals took their toll on the entire campus, people began to go home to enjoy their holiday break. Everyone believed we were in the clear. It wasn’t until today, I received two messages from unrelated people that the shitter striked again, but this time it wasn’t in the bathroom. (Assuming it’s the same person) it seems they got more confident and moved their game to the laundry room where one of the washing machines happened to be the final place for this semester. I don’t know the details: who found it, how long it’s been there, or who was left in the dorm to do it, no one does. All this time we have been coming up with ways to try and catch this person but nothing seems to be a good or legal idea. Cameras won’t work due to Title IX and because that’s just not okay. We can’t have someone sit and watch everyone who goes in because the school cannot demand RAs to do that. Having everyone log when they enter the bathroom would wind up just being an honor system which would get ignored easy. We can’t think up of a solution to this problem so I’ve come to you, not only to share this actually ridiculous tale, but to see if anyone could think of a way to catch whoever has been doing this. While it may be funny just because it keeps happening, it is still beyond disgusting and I want it to stop sooner rather than later. ",a6m8yh,self.college,,True

My classmates are cheating on tests. What do I do?,college,"A bit of background, I'm a senior in an EET program, and the class is a senior-level EET specific course. The tests in this course are open notes, meaning you can use any reference materials such as the book, class notes, or worksheets, but offline only. The last exam of the semester was extremely difficult, and as an A student I was shocked at how few problems I was able to have full confidence in solving. I know for a fact that I'm not going to be even close to an A, and this will likely cause me to receive a B in the course, and losing my 4.0 GPA. I knew that since I was the top student in the class that everyone else must've had trouble as well. I asked other students (who I know quite well, since they're in the same program) how they did on the test. Two of them (out of a 12 person class) told me quite boldly that they brought in an answer key of the test from a past semester. They said they did well using it. The professor doesn't check what people bring it as a reference, so people did so with impunity. The chances are high that more than those just those two cheated. So I'm beyond pissed about this. Here I am, an A student, getting a worse grade than C or B students because they found out an easy way to cheat. Say goodbye to any chance at a decent curve on the test when these clowns raise the average astronomically by cheating.

Lost an A because of my group,college,"I just finished taking an intro to Finance class and I thought it would be an easy A since the professor lets us have the equations for the exam. The homework wasn't hard, I attended class, I did the projects and on average I received an A. I was in the realm of 93-94 before the final and then a 91 after the final. There was also a final group project that hadn't been graded yet that was worth maybe like 5% of our grade. So all we needed was like a B on it. I know it sounds scary, but the only way not to get the points was not to do it since he's a forgiving grader. We split up the work and do it separately since it would be easier considering everyone's schedules. Somehow, I got an 89 in the class. I take a look at the project and lo and behold, someone didn't do their part who had told us he did. I of course email my professor about it stating that the group should not be punished if one person decided not to reach out to the group for help or just not do his work. Especially considering he was the one who turned it in for the group so we didn't even know he didn't do it. I know people are going to say we should have checked his work, but when you go to a commuter school, all you really want is to get your grades and move on. We felt that as long as everyone could do their work, we would be fine. But now the group is losing points to the point that I'm losing a whole letter that I need for my GPA. Students in the past have repeatedly told him about the group project and that it's more a detriment than a help. So i guess now all I can is wait since I emailed him an hour ago.

"The pressure of college, why is it worth it?",college,"I am 25 years old, and I had a good run the past year through community college. I proved to myself and family that I could get straight A's in subjects like math. I never knew what 'I wanted to do', and in fact I still don't know. I struggled with the whole 'going no where' thing, ever since I was out of high school. I did not do a single scrap of work, ever. In my early 20s, my only interest in college was science. So I started to major in Chem. After several developmental math courses up to precalc, I did very well. This fall semester, I took 3 courses: general chem 2, physics 1 and math. As time went on, I started to fall behind. I noticed that I would do whatever it took to forget all of the work ahead of me, and how impractical life and the idea of careerism is. I abuse all types of ways to relax and forget that I exist. I drink often, drugs, etc. just to try and forget the fact that I need to do all kinds of monotonous studying for the next 4 years to *maybe* get some career and or prove to others that maybe I'm not a loser. I have no sort of solace, and I learned that I am overall not mentally healthy being a college student on top of not being mentally healthy in the first place. These discoveries happened this particular semester, although when I was 19 I dropped out of community college with the same story. I thought maybe this past year of short success was my savior. I hate college, I hate the customs and I just hate the general idea of it. I hate the feeling of intense guilt, that my parents support me and pay my tuition, while I just sit and read books at 25. I always get the urge to just drop out, run away and start my own life somewhere else. What ever happened to just opening up your own mom and pop shop, just living a simple life? I've heard it all 'well it's worth it in the long run', 'do you want to scrub floors for the rest of your life?' Also things like, 'well, that's life.' Here is my answer to all of this: I do not care anymore. I would rather be homeless, I would rather work a shit job, I would rather lay in bed all day until I die. It has taken me almost a decade of brainstorming to tell you all this. I am so done with college and it's gimmicks and it's expensive necessities. They say 'maybe college isn't for you'. Honestly, I don't know what is or isn't for me anymore. But why do we pressure people so hard? Why does society perpetuate the idea that college is for the winners, the ones who succeed? Why does it seem that college is the only way to have an interesting career? I know this may all be debunked by someone- but let's be honest: media, parents, teachers, etc. all perpetuate this. So, when you drop out of college and pursue some certification program, a trade of some sort, or anything else really: why do we subconsciously consider that to be a downgrade? Would your parents at a family gathering be happier to tell everyone that you attained a degree, or that you're in a certification program? There's this degradation behind all of it, but at this point, fuck it. I am still enrolled and have a shit load of work to do this week. Me getting through this semester is looking extremely slim. I just wanted to express my thoughts and opinions on here. I'm sure a lot of people here are meant for college. For people like me, it's complicated. I like the idea of learning and becoming more intelligent. I just hate everything else about it. ",a5f8kg,self.college,,True

I had an incident where an RA entered my room while I was asleep. Is this normal?,college,"This happened about 2 years ago when I was still living in the college dorms. I had a room to myself in an upperclassman building. Prior to the incident I had had almost no contact with my floor RA besides the initial 'Welcome to the dorm' meeting at the beginning of the school year and they weren't very involved with the students at all. Now to what made me ask this question. It seemed like a totally normal night. I stayed up a bit late studying and finally turned on my tv to go to sleep to because I'm one of those people whose mind just goes crazy at night if something isn't occupying it. The problem occurred when I woke up the next morning. I found a note on my tv that was not there when I went to sleep, which meant someone had entered my room while I was sleeping. The note was from the RA saying that they had to enter my room in the middle of the night to turn off my tv. So apparently someone complained? I still don't know to this day. This all seemed pretty straightforward but throughout the day I felt VERY on edge that someone entered my room without my knowledge and I kept going through the scenario in my head, for example, if I had woken up and seen someone standing in my room in the dark I honestly can't say that I wouldn't have punched or tried to subdue that person out of fear I was being robbed. I never brought it up with the RA because it just made me feel so uncomfortable and I know by the rules that RA's were allowed to enter your room at any time, so instead I made sure my tv was at an acceptable volume from then on. Unfortunately though this question has still been plaguing my mind for awhile and I'd just really like an answer. Is this something that normally occurs? If an RA is assaulted because a student thinks their being burglarized what would happen in that scenario? Does this happen often and you just don't hear about it? ",a67ek7,self.college,,True

If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home. \- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your 3rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go. \- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position. \- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of. \- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say 'Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now.' Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there. \- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume. &#x200B; Enjoy the rest of your break!",aa0w4d,self.college,,True

The Issue with Extra Curricular Leadership Positions,college,"I go to a very competitive school and one major concern on everyone’s mind is the need to get an extracurricular leadership position. Observing my peers, I noticed something that resulted from this environment: leadership cannibalization. What exactly is this? Assume you’re a club leader interviewing people for a position. You receive a bunch of resumes and notice a candidate who is already involved in multiple clubs with leadership experience. You’re impressed and are highly considering offering the position to this student. You go on and conduct interviews. With no surprise, this candidate of interest performs exceptionally well. It’s a tough call between her and a few other students, so you pick her based on how impressive her resume is. Given her involvement, she surely will be successful taking on the position, right? Wrong! You offer the candidate the role and she accepts. As time goes on, you notice her performance is lacking. This student is always busy; sometimes she can’t always attend meetings due to other events or whatever the case may be. Although this student is bright, she can’t fully dive into the position and contribute as much as anticipated due to her other extracurriculars digging into her schedule. This is leadership cannibalization. The issue at hand is that (at least at my school) there is a huge gap between students who are highly and little involved with leadership opportunities. The ones who are highly involved take control of many available opportunities which results in the gap and degraded performance. Students aren’t concerned with what they can achieve with one position but how many positions they can put on a piece of paper. This mentality is wrong! In the end, I wanted to share this idea and see if anyone here agrees. I think people involved on campus should be highly conscious of this and focus more on developing meaningful experiences rather than racking up positions like its a trophy collection. There is only so much you can do with only 24 hours a day. tldr: There is a gap between students highly and little involved with campus leadership opportunities. Students with leadership roles are far more likely to acquire more. This drives the gap and also results in poor performance since such students have to handle very demanding schedules.",a6p837,self.college,,True

I can’t tell if I chose the wrong school,college,I just finished my first freshman semester at college . I chose a school very close to home but I’m living in the dorm. I’m a music performance major.

I guess the people in the music school are OK (I’m not SUPER SUPER close with anyone but I have a couple of decent friends) but I feel like I don’t fit in with the university as a whole. I’m the quiet nerdy type and the majority of this school just wants to hookup and party All the time. I don’t fit in at all.

So if you’re someone who’s struggling with mental health issues, consider taking a visit to your disability center to see if you can qualify to receive help for your classes.

Exam probably graded wrong again...advice on how to get my deserved grade?,college,"Hi guys, im in an econ class and before the final, i had a 94.23% in the class.

Do you crave breaks during the semester and want class during breaks?,college,"So finals just finished and I am waiting for my grades to come in. I feel confident in my finals, nothing too shocking and come to realize I am going home and getting a break. And I don't want it to come, I want to continue classes and learning rather than being bored at home and doing nothing besides working.

From 4.48 in high school to 2.94 in first semester of college...,college,"I feel terrible right now. I'm at the beginning of my winter break and literally the first thing every friend or family asks when I greet them is how my first semester was and 'how well I'm doing academically'. It destroys me every time. In high school I was able to graduate top 1% of my class of 400+, 35 ACT, All-State musician, published author in a scientific journal, plenty of meaningful leadership roles, etc. Full tuition scholarship and honors program at a top-30 University. That all means shit now. Now I'm struggling to get by in college. Part of me wants to blame my writing professor who told me he thought my essay was good and that I should only add a couple sentences and gave me a C anyway(only one of many related issues in that class). Part of me blames the fact that I rushed/pledged a professional frat my first semester, taking up much of my out-of-class time. My work ethic has improved but not enough to get me better grades and I'm not sure how to improve my discipline more. I don't even skip class. My low GPA is going to put me on academic probation from my honors program and possibly put my full-tuition scholarship at stake. I'm seeing all of my high school friends get either 4.0s or close while making great strides in internships/research on the side. I feel so lost in comparison. What can I do? All I read about is eliminating procrastination, improving discipline/work ethic but that's so vague and gives limited advice. I don't know what else to do because I feel like I have already been trying exactly that. Edit: Im majoring in Computer Engineering for context. Edit 2: Also a lot of my courses' tests are only created by the department so much of the time the professors do not know what the test will have. ",aaddxq,self.college,,True

does it not feel like Christmas to anyone else?,college,"i just finished my first semester of freshman year, and wow, it was terrible. long story short, everything that could have went wrong, went wrong, and i barely met my gpa requirent by .1. im back home for Christmas, and maybe it’s just because im older, but it’s Christmas day and i don’t feel happy. i spent a decent part of my morning crying in the shower thinking about everything that had happened. i don’t have any friends in my hometown and my grandparents couldn’t make it because grandfather is recovering from surgery (he’s fine btw he’s just the one that usually drives and he can’t rn). sorry this is a bit sad, but i was just wondering if anyone one else felt this way about the holidays.

Professor was late to a final and said it was our fault,college,"Hey I’m not sure where to post this but I’m kind of at a lost for what to do. It’s currently finals week as many of you know and I have been studying my ass off. Today I had a midterm for my psych class that was set to be at 3:30pm, I know this because on the online finals schedule that every professor follows it stated 3:30pm was the time of the final. So me along with a majority of my classmates show up at 3:30 and waited but my professor failed to show. We spoke to the head of the department and they informed us that if the teacher does not show in the next 30 minutes then we were legally(?) exempt from the exam. Every person that showed up signed their name on a piece of loose leaf as proof of their attendance, we then brought the paper to the head of the department to get it signed. We emailed the teacher a picture of the attendance sheet and a small paragraph explaining that we showed and she failed to show up on time so we were directed to leave. Anyways, 4:30 rolls around and we get an email from the professor saying that the exam was actually at 4:30 and she stated this in class last week and since we were not there for the exam we would all have to reschedule it and take it with a proctor on another day. Now this is where I’m at a loss because there was no follow up email or anything other then her ALLEGEDLY (i’m emphasizing this because if she stated it I’m sure no one would of showed up at 3:30) stating last week in class that it was moved to 4:30. Is this something that is allowed??? Correct me if I’m wrong but I think this is extremely unfair to everyone. Does anyone have any experience with this or know of what I should do?? Update: I couldn’t make it to the school because something came up (I had no final scheduled for today so my mom asked me to go with her to the doctor). However I did email the dean about the situation as well as my professor asking when I could reschedule the test because at this point fuck it I’m just going to take it and I know I’ll get a good grade on it anyways because I’ve studied a hell of a lot. Anyways, back to the stuff you guys care about- no one has responded to my emails. I sent both emails out at around 9am and I’m still waiting to hear back. Seems like I’m not much of a priority ‍♀️ New update: my professor emailed me back and my new test date is Monday at 11. I also still haven’t heard back from anyone else so that’s disappointing.

Does anyone else have to deal with this?,college,"My roommate literally sleeps in until about 2 pm everyday. All my classes start and end literally before she even opens her eyes. Does anyone else have to deal with tip-toeing around? It’s annoying. Edit: Ok let me add some stuff since you all think she is depressed. She isn't. We're pretty good friends, we get along really well and we talk about pretty much everything. This is literally the only problem I have with her. She just likes to go out Wednesday-Sunday and stay out until 3 or 4 am. She usually doesn't go to sleep until 3-5am on even other days. I think it's just a habit, not a disorder and not depression. Edit 2: Let me clarify MORE things since this is getting more traffic than I thought it would... We both have separate rooms, we share a suite (living room, kitchenette, bathroom). Her room is right by the bathroom and My room is by the kitchenette. Our rooms are right next to each other. Here is the layout of our room  ",a4y4gg,self.college,,True

I failed. 1.92 GPA. I don’t know where to go from here.,college,"*Edit 2: this post is getting a lot of attention, I just want to thank everyone for their advice. I definitely see my flaws. I have a game plan now on how to approach this next semester. It’s a hill to climb, and I will do it. Thank you!* In Highschool I was the kid who could get off without studying. 3.8 GPA for the kid who took AP classes, partied, listened to punk rock and showed up late to class. First semester of college. I get A- in Chem, C in Physics and flat out fail Calculus. Just because of that one stupid fucking class my GPA is below the minimum and now I’m stuck. I got issued an academic warning. My first semester was hard. I was forced to commute to college, I got fired from my job and found a new one. My relationship ended. I had to deal with my group of friends being disbanded. And I lost my burning motivation for a split second to keep working out. I didn’t party or drink at all. I showed up to class and did the homework. Guess it wasn’t enough. Now I’m waiting on an email from my advisor on what to do and what the consequences are. My game plan for the next semester given they let me continue to take the next sequence of classes, is to cut down the amount of Xbox I play, go to office hours and actually do the problems on the homework. I tried. I really did. I don’t understand I see all these memes and tweets of people praying they pass and they do, but here I am, actually giving it my best, and I fail. I’m hurt and scared. I don’t know what to do. I’m a chem Major and I intend to stick with it. EDIT: blown away by the support people.

Walked in on my roommate sucking his own dick,college,"I honestly don’t mind that much because I’ve seen my fair share of weird shit on the internet, and I’m pretty comfortable with nudity and masturbation, but my poor roommate is probably really embarrased. He immediately ran into the bathroom, got dressed and left out of my suitemate’s door (we share a bathroom with them). I haven’t seen him since then and I hope he isn’t too mortified to the point where he’s scared to come back to the room. Should I text/say anything to make him feel better or would that just make it worse and I should just act like it never happened? Guess I should knock in the future. I’m actually kind of impressed he’s that flexible EDIT: I just sent him a text saying “you’ve got nothing to be embarrased about bro. Sorry for not knocking” and I got a “thanks” back. Still waiting for him to return. EDIT 2: He just came back and immediately told me extremely apologetically that “he was sorry I had to see that” and I told him it’s all good and to enjoy what makes him happy EDIT 3: We talked a little more and I told him that I created this thread and encouraged him to respond to some of your questions.

Why does it seem like so many people are so anxious and depressed?,college,"Hello everyone, hope you are all having a fun finals week. &#x200B; I have made a discovery lately that has made me think quite a bit. As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay. &#x200B; I know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it. &#x200B; I just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling? There's just a lot going on in life right now and so much different things to think about it and I just wonder how people balance it or maintain a balanced mindset. &#x200B; Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this I just want to know how other people feel in their college experiences in their own lives and interacting with others.",a4qau2,self.college,,True
