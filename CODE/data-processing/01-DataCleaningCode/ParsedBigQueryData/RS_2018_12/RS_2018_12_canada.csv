Taking training while on EI with permission from Service Canada,canada,"Has anyone been able to take advantage of the changes described below? Person at Service Canada referred me to Ontario Works where I was referred back to Service Canada. Taking training while on EI with permission from Service Canada Have you lost your job after several years in the workforce? If so, starting on August 5, 2018, Service Canada may permit you to continue receiving EI benefits while attending a full-time program of your choice provided by an approved educational institution. You must pay for the training yourself. As of August 5, if Service Canada approves your request, you will not have to be available for work or look for work while at school. You may also be eligible for student financial assistance. Eligibility To be eligible, you must meet all of the following criteria: &#x200B; \- You must be receiving or be eligible to receive EI regular benefits or fishing benefits. \- You must be a long-tenured worker. A long-tenured worker is someone who has: &#x200B; \- received fewer than 36 weeks of EI regular and/or fishing benefits in the last five years; and \- paid at least 30 percent of the maximum EI annual premium in 7 of the last 10 years. To find out if you are considered a long-tenured worker, first apply for Employment Insurance benefits. Then call Service Canada at 1-800-206-7218. &#x200B; \- You must choose a program offered by an approved educational institution located in Canada. The institution must be on one of these lists: Designated Educational Institutions or Certified Educational Institutions. \- You must be considered a full-time student. Each educational institution decides what is considered a full-time program at their institution.

My MIL and my husband grew up eating them every year, and today I am making them with our toddler. But, no one in the family knows/remembers why they're called mochas as my MIL, Memere, and Pepere have all passed. So, can anyone help me out? Are you familiar with these? Are they common?

I'm just curious as to how accurate its portrayals of Canadians is? They don't really seem all that far off from Americans, me and my codriver who I showed bits and parts of the show, we both in real life in the US have ran into more than our fair share of 'real life Rickys'. Oh well I have one Canadian friend online, we've been friends for over 10 years and he's the one who introduced me to the show. Got a text from him yesterday in fact. He was a front line combat infantry soldier in Afghanistsn, and then for a while a paramedic in Calgary. He was telling me about some problems he'd been having on the job with the homeless around Calgary, so I told him next time he gets into an argument with a homeless person while doing paramedic work, before he drives off he should say 'go fuckoff somewhere, I got work to do' and he did, and the homeless man got really mad at him.",a21e4g,self.canada,,True

HELP ME CREATE A ‘LEGEND’ OR SECRET IDENTITY/ COVER STORY FOR A FILM CHARACTER,canada,"Hopefully if this isn’t the best place to be asking someone can point me in a good direction... I’m part of a small production team for a short film and in need of some help in creating a realistic ‘legend’ or fake identity for one of the main characters. For reasons I can’t get into (NDA’s etc...) I cant say anything about the script beyond this: In order to preserve a part of the story that the writer/ director is insisting on keeping, the character’s cover identity needs to be from Canada. It doesn’t really matter where, but a crucial part of the storyline involves the Canadian government. Over the course of the film, there are a series of short scenes where the character is ‘rehearsing’ his legend/ backstory - either in the mirror of a train bathroom, or listening to Canadian radio stations to familiarize himself with popular music/ stations in a given area... In any case, being that I’m not from Canada I figured I would cast my net out and see what kind of interesting character I could crowd source from the Internet. If anyone has an idea for a specific part of Canada that has a special character or vibe, ideally a part of Canada that has a sort of cult status among Canadians. I’m doing my own research of course because I’m on a rough deadline but again I just thought to go straight to the source. Merci d’avance for all your help!",a5q1xl,self.canada,,True

"FYI for the Holidays, Indigo is sending their orders out directly to the UPS store for pickup and not attempting home delivery.",canada,"I just thought I would put this out there because it caught me off guard being different than how deliveries usually go. I had an order coming from Indigo and it got split up, half being delivered by Canada Post and half by UPS. I was waiting for it to arrive on the day UPS said it would be delivered but it didn't show up and I didn't receive a 'we missed you' slip either telling me it they tried to drop it off when I wasn't home. Looking back at the status update emails you get from UPS it looked like they said it had been delivered, so I contacted my local UPS store and they informed me that they did have the package but there was no slip at my door because Indigo is only sending out packages for UPS store pick up, they aren't sending packages under shipping options that actually attempt home delivery. The most frustrating part is I have been to the door four times this week accepting packages delivered by UPS for my father's business so its not like they are so slammed that direct delivery isn't even possible. **TLDR: Double check your email to make sure your Indigo order hasn't been shipped directly to the UPS store**",a3f3og,self.canada,,True

[needadvice] Death of a Canadian married to US citizen,canada,"My uncle (Canadian) passed away 1 week ago. He lived in the US with his wife (US citizen). They do not have any children so I am helping my aunt organize their financial accounts. They have several financial accounts in Canada-stocks, pension, a few different savings, etc. They also own real estate property there. Up until now, the accounts stayed in Canada because they didn’t want to take a hit moving them to the US. She contacted one of her banks (TD) to let them know her husband passed and how should she proceed and was told she cannot mail certified documents (will, death certificate) but would have to come up to Canada to sign papers. Is this normal procedure? They do have a financial advisor that handles all of their stocks etc in Canada but she never made decisions regarding them, her husband did. We did contact the Canadian government because he was getting old age pension and social security (not sure what its called there). Any advice on what we need to make sure we take care of would be much appreciated. My immediate thought is to move it all here so it’s easily accessible for her but that would mean losing a huge amount in the exchange. ",a7il8x,self.canada,,True

Lately I've been working on an apartment going unit to unit. Today's unit, which was the last unit, was for an old lady that could not be younger than 70. When I finished, she gave me a Toblerone bar, a 6 pack of beer, a can of homemade canned salmon, and a cannon of a joint with a bud to go along. She said it was a Christmas present.

The generosity of Canadians is amazing,canada,"My company does an annual drive for the local Food Bank. I volunteered my time for a couple of hours on Saturday to help out. We were at a Superstore (if you don’t know what it is, it’s a giant store, owned by Loblaws) and my job was to hand out shopping bags and info with what important items the Food Bank is looking for. 2 incidents really impressed on me how Canadians really do their best to help others: First, a female, probably late 20s, was walking into the store and I asked her to help out if she could (just like I was doing with everyone). I could see she was about to say no but then she said “I’ll see what I can do.” When she came out of the store she had 3 cans of Chunky Soup in her arms and she handed me one. She looked at me and said “this is all I can do” and I could see she was almost in tears. I quickly said “if you can’t, then don’t worry about it, take care of yourself” and she said “it’s ok, I want to.” It was clear that she was in some financial difficulty, but she still did what she could. Second, there was a fellow who spoke very little English and he was having difficulty understanding what I was telling him, so I did my best to explain and he said “ok, I’ll see what I can do.” He went in the store and then a few minutes later came back out and asked me if the shopping bag was for free. I said “sure, here you go” and handed him one, not thinking too much about it. When he came out of the store about 20 minutes later, he took a few small items out of the shopping bag and said “I hope this is enough” to which I replied “whatever you can do to help is appreciated, thank you.” After he handed me the items, he said “but I can keep the shopping bag, right?” To which I replied, laughing a bit, “Sure man, you can keep the bag, thanks for your donation.” These 2 interactions really reminded me of how generous we are as a nation and how we all help each other in times of need. To these 2 people, thanks for your help, it’s appreciated. To everyone who is able, go volunteer for a few hours to help your local food bank. A couple of hours of your time will be appreciated. To everyone else who donated, thank you for your generosity, some families in need will be better off for it. TL;DR - help out a local charity, you never know who’s life you may affect in a positive way ",a2q8p6,self.canada,,True

That is party truly, but keep in mind, we have 2 networks Canada wide. Bell(including virgin) and Telus (including koodo/public mobile) share a network nationwide. They will be using Huawei for 5g. Telus and bell have openly stated this as seen . Now currently, Rogers does use Huawei in the west but that is being transitioned out to Ericsson. So is Huawei shaping 5g in Canada? It sure is, but it’s not building the 5g network nationwide. If anything, I’m personally concerned that our government members of parliaments use bell services, thus meaning they are at risk to Huawei services. ",a3lqi7,self.canada,,True

I've applied to many jobs so far and have heard nothing back. I have been saying I could start as early as 2 months from now since I'm still studying and would need time to line up moving and an apartment and whatnot I've had friends and family look over my cover letter and resume and they dont see any issue with it. I'm thinking I might take it to a professional just in case though. I spend a ridiculous amount of time reading up on companies I'm applying for and incorporate this into my cover letter. Like I'll spend a whole day just to get enough ready to apply for a handful of jobs. And I actually give a shit about what I see and hear. There are jobs I didnt apply for based on what i heard about the companies. Now i kind of regret that because i feel desperate So far I haven't heard a single thing. Nada. I've even applied for jobs that I would consider myself a little over qualified for based on their qualifications. The reality it seems though is there are few jobs that put a posting out saying no years experience required so you're forced to apply to those that require some even if you have none It's kinda bumming me out and also putting me in a very serious spot as after December I will have no stipend from my degree. I'm actually worried I might end up homeless if I dont find something by March based on any savings I have I'm concerned at this point that I'll have to start looking at the US and I dont want to do that. My whole family is here and I have ties here specifically, and I actually like the country Please, those that are good at this, share some tips. How long should I expect to wait before I hear something after applying? Should I follow up after a certain amount of time?

M.A.I.D. in Canada,canada,"For those who are unaware, M.A.I.D. stands for medical assistance in dying.  This legislation came into effect in June of 2016. I will be forever thankful to all of those who fought for this legislation. My mother died yesterday on her own terms. Not on the terms of the disease that was taking her body an inch at a time. For over thirty years my mother has been living with diffuse scleroderma. While many are able to live with scleroderma, my mothers was chipping away at her body and reducing her quality of life. Regardless, she persevered. In the last two years she started to lose more of the fights. Then the pneumonia set in. As her breathing deteriorated, she began to have panic attacks and nightmares. My mother didn't want to die. She had grandchildren she adores, family that loves her, and life she wanted to live. But this disease made that impossible. It stole basic bodily functions from her and was coming after her lungs. The doctors tried so hard to help her. To try and manage the issues to give her a decent quality of life. But her body didn't respond to the treatments, then it was too weak for most options. To further complicate treatment, she could not be given many of the normal pain medications as they caused more suffering and brought little relief. Even the last resort options were no longer working and a decision had to be made. Knowing that she would suffocate while fully aware, she chose M.A.I.D.. She chose to go on her own terms and not in terror, gasping for breath, being suffocated by her own body. I am so thankful my mother had this option. She spent her last days surrounded by her family. Surrounded by love. I got to tell her good bye. That I loved her. That I was proud she was my mother. I am so thankful my mother had this option. For those who are opposed to M.A.I.D., I do understand. This is not a choice for all and it was not easy to watch. But in your opposition of it, I ask that you please don't fight M.A.I.D. If you want this to end, fight the diseases that lead to people choosing M.A.I.D.. Support research looking for a cure for scleroderma, or cystic fibrosis, or ALS, or cancer. Fight for the end of these diseases that torture people in their own bodies. These are people who are dying already. My mother wouldn't not have lived much longer. But those last days would have been with great pain and suffering. Don't fight the option that lets people suffering these diseases find relief surrounded by their families and loved ones. I am so thankful my mother had this option. ",a4d7t5,self.canada,,True

DOES A LONG PROCESSING TIME FOR A STUDY PERMIT MEANS A REJECTION?,canada,"Hey y'all, Note: I will not include application numbers or UCI for discretion and privacy reasons. I come from a wealthy family but have a shitty nationality. Disclaimer: I respect and obey laws of all countries. I agree upon the terms and conditions of Canada, CIC and the Canadian Embassies. I do not hate any Canadian governmental entity and 100% NOT promoting hatred towards any person or governmental authority of any nationality. I am sorry if this post tilts anyone. So basically I am applying for a study permit outside Canada from a country other than my shitty home country. The first time I applied was on the 26th of September 2018 (NO ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS PROVIDED, MANDATORY SUPPORTING DOCUMETS PROVIDED). This application was viewed/updated by CIC officer twice or more per week (I get notifications on email for that). Then It was rejected by the embassy on the 6th of November 2018 for various reasons such as no proof of returning back to homeland or country of residence other than Canada, not convincing purpose of travel and no ties to country of residence ( country you are applying from ) or home country. I read the refusal letter from embassy 3 times and it said: if you believe you have strong proofs that can change your permit situations and answer the misinterpretations we have please provide them in a new application if you wish. You are free to reapply at any time because there is no ban given to you. As of anyone with half decent data plan, I reapplied with a new application (that I included an additional document of letter of explanation of my current situations and additional proofs of ties and etc..) on the 12th of November 2018. Till now I didn't get any update/view from the CIC officer except one time on the 13th of November 2018. I think that the CIC officer is uninterested in my application and this brings me to the point that I may be rejected again which will leave a dark cloud in my logistics records for future visa applications for Canada or any other country ( I need a visa that is pain in the ass to get in order for me to travel to any country in the world. As well as result in a huge drama with my university after I have registered in 15 credit hours (registration list was sent to CIC in the second application) Travel/Visa Log: All of my past travels are legal and flawless. I think this is somehow critical Travelled to Georgia (Country) visa free and stayed for less than a month (underaged and 16 years old). Applied with my family for a US visitor visa (underaged and 14 years old) and was rejected for no proofs of return after travelling and was banned for 6 months and was allowed to reapply any time after 6 months. Tldr; I want (hopefully) human friendly legal advices on what to expect and what to do in case of an upcoming rejections.

Very specific Canadian border-related question,canada,"Let me preface this by saying this: I have never crossed a border into another country on my own before. So my experience in this area is zero. I've never had a passport to my name. I apologize in advance for poor wording. However, in the past year, I obtained a REAL ID Michigan license, (using my parents' address) the one that lets you traverse through the Canadian border and back. Unfortunately, in the same year, I also started attending college in Ohio and my parents also moved from Michigan to Ohio. My mom then had me change my postal address to her new Ohio one. So my question is: I have a REAL ID enhanced Michigan license, Michigan plate but Ohio address (I am a bit late to change it due to financial/work related obstacles up till now) Would I run into issues using my Michigan license to cross the Canadian border with the Ohio address on my 'file'? My apologies for the somewhat drawn out post. Just a question I had trouble finding an answer for myself on Google. Im also sorry if this isn't the subreddit to ask this LOL",a6udxg,self.canada,,True

CRA Tax Refund Scam Etc Would you have a solution?,canada,"Hello, I'm pretty sure by now everyone at some point has heard of something close or known someone who has had these calls either robo or person from some 3rd world call center saying that their under investigation or that they are owed a refund or whatever in order for you to expose details to your bank or to scam you. I'm posting here because if this went on twitter it'd just die immediately because I'm not a celebrity, someone of influence, or someone that's attractive enough to hold attention (I'm average at best). So I choose Reddit to be my face because Reddit's the face of the internet (*runs around to get high fives). I was thinking about it for a while and I came up with two solutions and I was wondering if A. We could get enough attention on this that something might be done or B. We just keep bringing it up until those who can do something get frustrated enough to act. End goal is that I know we can't fully stop it as they will always find new ways but by putting up these obstacles we can keep them predictable and at the same time make it harder because it takes longer for them. My first proposed solution would be for the Personal Computer side. There is always going to be independent or remote software that isn't Vnc or Teamviewer that will be used. A law would take too long to be put in place and there's no guarantee, but for your bank to whip up a landing page to warn those who are gullible and have them interact or accept wouldn't take long. Obviously don't make it long just short to the point with a graphic of picture. Something in the lines of maybe 'This is a reminder to never give your bank passwords and to be mindful to log out of any remote access or assistance software and that the CRA does not do...' The weird thing is some of my banks have something like this, but its AFTER you login which is redundant. My second proposed solution for the phone calls is similar to the Computer one. I'm not sure if banks are willing to propose that their tellers leave a reminder at their counter but often times these are done through an ATM machine and we've seen those scotiabank or RBC ads about more of their products on the ATM screen. Why not have it there as well as a reminder but with a 5 second count down or something that forces them to wait or stop for a moment. Everyone that's 'in a rush' wouldn't stay for 2 minutes but its 5 seconds for that person to breathe as its an unavoidable obstacle. The intent would be (I'm in no way a psychologist) for them to have a break for a moment and to seed the thought that hey the CRA never does these types of calls only by mail, it could break their psychosis. Most of these scammers rely on pressure tactics that put their target into these panicked states, which means either they see it through or they break it momentarily long enough to come to their senses. At least that's from my perspective. I know CRTC previously cited that their enforcement is unable to trace these people but to keep public opinion they would display news headlines like 'Big bust in India as a joint CRTC and Indian police bust up a CRA scam operation...' They use dead numbers from Rogers/Bell but they are re-routed through something so all you would ever see is the dead number hence why they give you another number to call back to. They say it's difficult to trace, but I remember that one CBC investigation that located the call center in Pakistan very easily. I don't have the knowledge or experience of these experts or those who specialize in certain levels of investigations, psychology, tactics, etc therefore I ask you, the public of Reddit what are your thoughts and potential solutions?",aapv9o,self.canada,,True

Ice Thickness Tester,canada,"Very simple design in mind for a device. Walking Stick with a 15 cm Crossbar Device at bottom. Stand on sensing end of device. It has a hinge and you lift walking stick and drop it to click a deadblow 'clicker' at other end of 15cm Crossbar. Another version would use a wheel and cam drop which would allow mapping and logging a precise profile of the ice, because you would take a measure every turn of the wheel. Sensor should hear two clicks. One direct. One reflection off bottom of ice. Lookup table in an Arduino type microcontroller and you get the ice thickness. Thinner Ice means those two clicks are heard very close together. Thick enough ice and the reflection should take twice as long. I could build a prototype. I could even set up production. I would rather pass this on as project for some communty college students, with any commercial development as a nonprofit with Skate Canada and Hockey Canada as beneficiary. This should improve safety and save lives. Somebody will still fall through ice and drown and sue. Saves lives but still no way I would want to profit if someone is going to sue me over it. I also see no reason why it should not connect to your phone by Bluetooth and upload logs of the ice data and location data to the web. I would be interested in seeing what that tells us about climate change. Is this a stupid idea? I could just take my cordless drill out and make a bunch of holes to satisfy my curiosity about the lake in the back yard.

I'm lost regarding my education ?,canada,"I'm 18, I live in Toronto Ontario, I finished only up to the 11th grade of HS before dropping out due to mental health issues and issues at home.

I have never been employed before so I have 0 experience in working, I'm just staying at home for the majority of the day for the moment. I'm thinking of taking the GED test at 19 years old and then use that to apply to universities, but I heard that universities in Ontario does not accept the GED which makes me really regret not finishing HS. I was wondering what are some ways I can do to get back on track? What are alternatives to getting accepted into big universities like York Univeristy or Ryerson or University of Toronto? I'm thinking of joining a community college first (is that a US only thing? I couldn't find anything regarding community college in Canada), then once I have a diploma of 2 years or so, I will use that to apply to universities, will this work? I as a person have great ambition, I made a big mistake by not finishing HS, I want to go really far in life, I want to get into good schools and achieve good GPA, but right now, I'm very lost, I need a plan, a direction leading me back to success.

Adding a measly 15 minutes to vessel travel time to save the Orcas,canada," So let me get this straight: There are only 74 southern resident orcas left (!), and they frequent an area with a lot of big boats/vessels and there are valid concerns that the noise is contributing to their decline. The pilot project asked commercial vessels to reduce their speed slightly in area of concern; the vessel in the news piece would be asked to reduce its speed by 7%, from 13.5 knots down to 12.5 knots over a relatively shot distance. This speed reduction increases their voyage by 15 minutes. This would only apply between June to the end of October, which is when the whales are typically found in that particular shipping lane. For vessels crossing the pacific, their voyage time would increase from, on average, 17 days and 0 minutes to 17 days and 15 minutes, or about a 0.01% increase. The speed reduction reduced the shipping noise by 2.5 dB underwater, which I assume is not insignificant. I'm no whale specialist or economist, and maybe someone can chime in, but why isn't this a regulation yet? 88% of the vessels voluntarily complied with the speed reduction anyways. Even if some expert determines a decade from now that the noise isn't a problem for the orcas, out of obvious concern and a short time to act, we should act now. TLDR: Reducing transit time on big boats passing through a relatively small area with lots of orca whales by a measly 15 minutes reduces noise by 2.5 dB, why isn't this the law yet (!?), only 74 southern resident orcas left. (Edit to add TLDR)",a78aw8,self.canada,,True

EU citizen looking to move to Canada (Toronto),canada,"Hi guys, &#x200B; recently I'm thinking of a change, specifically, I'm thinking of moving to Canada (Toronto). I'm 26 y/o software engineer with 3 years of experience, coming from Croatia and I'm seriously considering Toronto for my next working/living destination. I did a bunch of research on my own ofc but I would appreciate advice from Canadian or Toronto residents (everyone knows that Canadian people are the nicest most polite people in the world :) ). &#x200B; So since I have a multiple questions I would like to make some sort of list what I'm most interested in. &#x200B; 1. How complicated is moving from EU to Canada and getting a work permit and what I'm supposed to do in order to get it 2. The current job market for programmers and software developers, how hard is it to find a job and what kind of salary should I expect and look for 3. Getting an apartment and also what price range I can expect for average 2 room apartment 4. General quality of life and your experiences (especially people that moved like I'm planning to, how did your transition went) 5. Anything important I might have forgotten to mention? &#x200B; I hope you don't find this question as a lazy attempt for other people to do research for me but as you know all things are not easily google-able and I think people with personal experiences and pieces of advice are much more useful than generic texts. I appreciate answers in any kind of form even if it's just about a single point from my list or multiple (good links or short/long advice). &#x200B; Thank you all in advance and looking forward to your answers and even more coming to your beautiful country :) &#x200B; Cheers &#x200B; EDIT: To reformulate my question, I'm asking for people experiences, not exact information, like 1 where should I go to get a work permit and so on...",a9f5gj,self.canada,,True

"Air Canada Customer Service - Using Flight Credit, Need to Vent",canada,"My father tried to book a flight for me with Air Canada (AC) on his phone, the page broke down during the process and he assumed it hadn't worked. When he got home, he booked another flight for me on the same day. He found out later that he had in fact booked and been charged for 2 different flights. Calling AC he was told no refund but he now has a flight credit in my name for the amount of the unused flight (\~$1000). Because of the extensive restrictions on this flight credit it will now go unused, I'm used to there being a decent amount of red tape involved but some of these rules seem very silly to me. Here is a list of all the rules I know about. &#x200B; |Rules|Reasonableness (10=completely reasonable)|Comment| |:-|:-|:-| |Must be an AC Flight|10|Makes Sense| |Expires after 12 months, can get 3 month extension. (flight date not booking)|5|I get they would want to push you to use it quick to get it off the books, but this seems very strict. I called to book a flight during the extension for a date 3 months after the extension - no go, no flexibility.| |Must be in the name of the original passenger or you have to pay \~$50 each way service fee.|8|Things like this are pretty common. This seems like it would make it easy to use, can offer it to another family member and only have to pay another $100-150.| |Must be used domestically in Canada or you have to pay more than $100 each way service fee|4|This seems strange and highly restrictive. They told me to fly an oversees family member here with it would cost a lot (300-500 in fees) and may not be doable.| |Must be used on a single ticket only (return ok) any amount unused is then forfeit|2!|The first thing I wanted was to book for my wife and I domestic since tickets were only about 500 each. Nope. No money left over after my 500 ticket, its just theirs then. Not even with paying service fees or anything.| |You cannot pay service fees with the left over money from the credit|1!|This makes no sense to me. I was going to cave and get a flight much cheaper than the $1000 and thought at least those fees could be payed with the wasted money. Nope, all fees must be cash. So I would end up using only some of the money and still have to pay like 300 just to use it and have to book with only AC which is more expensive to begin with. Maybe there is a good reason for this, i'm not sure what it is though.| |Absolutely no refund|9|Reasonable, but they could not investigate if the booking was an error on their end and no chance they would even talk about a refund was frustrating at the end knowing I can't find a use for the thing.| |In fairness they did say they give seat upgrades with any unused flight credit money - but I don't care about that.||| Long story short, they get the $1000 for nothing now. The only thing I can do is not fly AC again and vent on the internet.

"BEWARE: Paypal SCAMMING Candians, DO NOT enter holiday sweepstakes!",canada," The Paypal holiday sweepstakes is just a ruse to get Canadians to waive their rights to take paypal to court, especially class action lawsuits. This is a disturbing anti-consumer trend that companies are recently adding to their terms of service in the U.S.. In most countries something like this simply isn't allowed to be slipped into something people don't tend to read. Enter the holiday sweepstakes. Now in it's later days, this is put up at the front of it's official rules, while it was buried in the fine print at the outset of the promotion: THIS CONTRACT ALSO REQUIRES YOU TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION If you don't know, arbitration tends to work out MUCH better for the big guy. I don't know if you can get out of it. The gaming chat app DISCORD has an opt-out email for this clause, maybe paypal is required to do something similar. I apologize for not posting this when I first noticed, I didn't know where on reddit you would post something like this, hopefully here works. I haven't done much looking into this, I thought I should just get it done already. &#x200B; Side note; I get that this is a trend with companies these days, but we trust paypal with out financial info, buying habits etc. It's lots of very personal information. It's very worrisome that paypal is concerned about getting hit with class-actions.. what exactly are they planning to do that would open them up to something like that.. I feel like I want to find an alternative to paypal now. I've got some ideas.. ",a41a76,self.canada,,True

"Solution to high Communications plans (Cell phone, Internet, and Television)",canada,"Hello, I know in Canada we have one of the most expensive communications bills every month simply because there are 3 big companies who own 3 medium sized slightly discounted companies who all own Canadian wallets on a monthly basis year after year. I personally don't pay for television (I pay Spotify and my brother pays Netflix) but my internet bill for my house is about $100 a month, this is a speed suitable for my needs, along with my roomates and guests who frequent the home. For people who are 25 years old and younger, who have lots of student debt and other sorts of debt and high living expenses, this number should be reduced. Not to mention my phone plan is an additional $75 a month. &#x200B; Now I understand that the blame is not simply on that of the corporate individuals known and Bell, Rogers and Telus, it lies on the consumer and I suppose other corporate individuals like Google, Samsung, Apple, LG, etc... who release ?new? products year after year and through a barbaric amount of advertisements that seem more natural to the human mind than growing our own food, we the consumer, the individual citizens continue to support these corporate individuals by purchasing the products regularly. &#x200B; We buy into this idea that we need to pay for things to live, housing, food, clothing, water. All are basic human needs that we have been trained, and trained rather proficiently to purchase life. &#x200B; Why don't we buy into an idea, an idea that is complete opposite of the current system, yet with uncanny formula is exactly the same. We buy into this idea that paying a ridiculous amount of money for a service that has become naturally essential to life in our society is simply the way things go. What if we buy into this idea where we simply stop paying for the service? It would require the same dedication we all have placed into paying these high prices, so it is very possible. But it would require most, if not all of us to stop paying our bills until something more fair is offered to us. Bell Nets around $3 billion a year, the CEO is making around $11 million a year. &#x200B; Everyone complains that the prices are too high and how it is unfair. The government hears the complaints and release surveys for us to fill out, where they are basically asking us questions we have already brought forward as issues. Action like this is the likely way to get them to actually listen. &#x200B;",a2e64q,self.canada,,True

Practice your french here!,canada,"Bonjour mes amis, Plusieurs usagers dans les derniers mois et dans le recensement ont exprimé leur désir d’avoir accès à une plateforme pour pratiquer leurs habiletés en français et les améliorer davantage. Dans cet esprit, nous accueillerons les « vendredis français ». Ce seront des fils punaisés tous les vendredis dans le but particulier de pratiquer, de lire et d’écrire en français. Nous espérons identifier un thème de départ pour lancer la discussion, mais toute discussion en français est bienvenue dans le fil. **Les règles de ce fil sont plutôt simples :** 1. Toutes les règles habituelles du sous-reddit sont toujours en vigueur 2. Essayez d’écrire en français autant que possible, même si votre français est cassé 3. Évitez les discussions de nature politique pour garder l’objectif des conversations à propos de l’utilisation de la langue, et idéalement pas de façon argumentative. Les francophones de langue maternelle et les apprenants potentiels sont encouragés à se joindre à la discussion et à favoriser les apprentissages. Plus tard, nous travaillerons à créer un insigne pour ceux qui facilitent ces discussions pour les y identifier. Ce n’est pas l’endroit pour remettre en question le rôle du français dans la société, du gouvernement ou de la politique canadienne ou pour attaquer les communautés francophones. Le français est parlé par des Canadiens d’un bout à l’autre de notre grand pays et l’intention est ici d’encourager les utilisateurs à développer leurs habiletés linguistiques. Vous pouvez bien sûr visiter /r/quebec, /r/french, /r/learnfrench, /r/francophonie, /r/francaiscanadien ou /r/france pour continuer votre apprentissage tous les jours de la semaine.

Alberta Oil,canada,"I dont intend on creating an argument with this, I know a lot of people get defensive on the topic of Alberta oil. I want to start a discussion on this though. As recently I have come across articles talking about Quebec not wanting to ship Alberta oil to the east, the Keystone XL pipeline that would have sold Alberta Oil to the states just got shut down at a federal US level, and BC has fought the pipeline expansion at the provincial government level since the current premier got power. Alberta has built their economy on oil, but when do they look at the resistance they have and consider that they have to work on other forms of income? I am not looking for a heated argument on this, I am looking for a discussion, curious to see what others think. I see both sides of the story, as i try to be as environmentally friendly as I can but my main hobby, and my job, is built around the automotive industry and I understand the necessity of the oil industry. Should Alberta keep fighting for the oil industry? Should they start investing in other technologies based on where the world is going? Some way to invest in electric cars, as when the oil industry severely drops in the next 20 years the electric car will grow in sales?

Do any of you own cottages or property in different provinces,canada,I live in Ontario and like a lot of other Canadians in Ontario my family is having trouble affording property in this place. Dad bought a house long time ago when they were affordable but we can’t afford anything new at this point. I always wanted a cottage and the Yukon Territory looks cool. Property doesn’t look too crazy and the location looks beautiful. The problem would be going from Ontario to the Yukon when I want to go up there. I know I don’t have to go that far to get an affordable cottage but I like the idea of experiencing such a different place that I wouldn’t be able to before without moving my entire life up there. Just go up when I have some time off and come back when I need to. Plus I like the geography of the Yukon Territory. I also saw some dirt cheap cottages for like 70 to 200 grand online. That doesn’t even get you a shoebox in my area. Everything is 700k plus. Most good property is a million plus Was wondering if any of you do this. I don’t expect anyone to own a cottage that far but maybe you own a house in Ontario and have a cottage in Quebec or something. I really want to do this seems like a fun idea but don’t know the pros and cons. TLDR: I want to buy a cottage far away for the hell of it ,ab59an,self.canada,,True

"Canada Post sent my package back to the sender without my permission, is there anything I can do?",canada,"I ordered a jacket online and had it shipped to a Canada Post location. I received an email 3 days ago saying it was available for pick up, and that I have 14 days to pick it up. I went in today and they told me it was already shipped back to the sender because 'I' denied the package. This was incredibly confusing because I never denied my package. It turns out that coincidentally, my tenant who lives at the same address went to the same Canada Post location inquiring about THEIR package. The associate searched up their address and found that a package (i.e. MY package) was ready for pick up. Of course, my tenant said that the package is not his, so he did not take it. The associate insisted that because the address matches with his ID, it must be his. They disregarded the fact that we have completely different names. My tenant insisted that he was not comfortable with taking my package and left it. So Canada Post ended up sending the package back to the sender because the 'receiver' denied the package. I asked the same associate if they can redirect it back to my house, but they said this is impossible without a police request. They said that they only need a matching address and a matching name is NOT needed to authorize pickups/returns. The manager took absolutely no responsibility. He said that I need to instruct my tenants to clearly specify that they are not me. Does this mean that the 10~ people living at my address (tenants + my own family) all have access to any of my mail? Worst of all, this could have been so much worse. The associates had no idea who my tenant was. This means that if my tenant had ill intentions, he could have easily stolen my package and Canada Post would have no idea who he was. I only found out my tenant went to Canada Post because he told me. I called the retailer and they said I am out of luck. I can't reorder this item because it is out of stock. Is there just nothing I can do? ",a525ne,self.canada,,True

Dans cet esprit, nous accueillerons les « vendredis français ». Ce seront des fils punaisés tous les vendredis dans le but particulier de pratiquer, de lire et d’écrire en français. Nous espérons identifier un thème de départ pour lancer la discussion, mais toute discussion en français est bienvenue dans le fil. **Les règles de ce fil sont plutôt simples :** 1. Toutes les règles habituelles du sous-reddit sont toujours en vigueur 2. Essayez d’écrire en français autant que possible, même si votre français est cassé 3. Évitez les discussions de nature politique pour garder l’objectif des conversations à propos de l’utilisation de la langue, et idéalement pas de façon argumentative. Les francophones de langue maternelle et les apprenants potentiels sont encouragés à se joindre à la discussion et à favoriser les apprentissages. Plus tard, nous travaillerons à créer un insigne pour ceux qui facilitent ces discussions pour les y identifier. Ce n’est pas l’endroit pour remettre en question le rôle du français dans la société, du gouvernement ou de la politique canadienne ou pour attaquer les communautés francophones. Le français est parlé par des Canadiens d’un bout à l’autre de notre grand pays et l’intention est ici d’encourager les utilisateurs à développer leurs habiletés linguistiques.

Immigration told me they don't accept applications from Mexicans,canada," So I wish I had this in writing because this almost seems surreal to me. I met this angel who was visiting in Winnipeg for a few months and fell in love. She's a nurse back in Mexico, and we want to keep the relationship going, so she went down to the immigration office to inquire about getting an application started to try to move to Winnipeg. She came back saying that the person working there told her that they aren't accepting any applications from Mexicans. In disbelief, I called the office back, and the guy told me something along the lines of 'I'm not sure the reason why, but we aren't accepting applications from Mexicans'. In addition to that, the au pair program in Canada is often a way for people to see the world as a working traveler, but Au Pair Canada also said they don't accept applications from Mexicans or Ukrainians. This one I at least can find in writing that I'll link below, but for finding information on why they don't accept any applications for Mexican immigrants on a hardline basis I'm coming up empty. I can't even find something related to this on google. I'm curious if anyone has any insight as to wtf the reasoning is for this? I'm in complete disbelief, given how much of the news is filled with how bad Trump is towards illegal immigration from Mexico, so I have no idea how our own government silently went hardline against legal immigration from Mexico. I feel like this is a story that should be blowing up our news, but they won't give me anything in writing. ",a5thmd,self.canada,,True

The Alberta government is basically banking on this in order to survive the next election and the federal government is trying to follow the courts directions to get it built by doing better consultations. Surely it would be more effective to protest in Vancouver or Victoria to send a message to the BC government rather than the two who actually are trying to get it built. EDIT: If it has do do with bill C69, Governments of all coulours have had the opportunity to try to try to get pipelines built over the past decades with the current system and none have succeeded.

My research has stated that this began in France in regards to fuel prices and climate change. Admittedly, my research has been nominal. It doesn't look like what is happening in Canada follows the same values. This is what my friend has stated: 'We just want proper legal immigration with criminal checks etc n not a free for all on our country.' We have both discussed legal immigration and we are both pro immigrants. However, I think that his issue is refugees. When I stated that refugees had not caused any physical harm to Canada, he stated that the incel who recently drove a van into civilians in Toronto had ties to refugees. I didn't get into further details. I personally don't follow his thought process.

Happy Holidays!,canada,"Mys*elf* and the mod team wanted to take a brief opportunity to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Feel free to take this opportunity to share with the community your well wishes for the upcoming new year, your own holiday traditions, or your experiences over Christmas day. Many of us will find ourselves on home made rinks or enjoying special treats around the holidays and it's a great time to share our unique (and often very similar) holiday activities! The Christmas, and the holiday season, is a great time to spend time with friends and family, and I encourage you all to put down the phones, tablets and whatever device you use, and take a break. Even if you are looking at something on r/wholesomememes, the holidays are a great time to take a break from the devices and focus on yourself, friends, and familiy. While many of us turn our attention towards our families, the Holiday season can also be a challenging and stressful time for many Canadians, so a kind word or simply reaching out to an old friend to say hello can mean a lot at this time of year. Some users here may feel alone, or may be in crisis, you are not alone. There are resources out there to help you, or even to have someone to talk to. If you or someone you love is in crisis, I encourage you to get help. I know it is not easy to take that first step and realize you need help. For those of you who have served, I encourage you to reach out to your brothers and sisters, just hearing a friendly voice can be the difference between life and death. If you are a veteran or serving member in crisis, there is help out there, Veterans Affairs maintains a 24/7 line to help those who need mental health support (1-800-268-7708). Recognizing you need help is as important as getting the support and help you need. You are not alone. We hope you all have a safe and festive holiday season. No matter how you celebrate, please be safe and remember not to drink (or smoke) and drive. Every year we see tragic posts about families torn apart as a result of preventable accidents. Please do not drink and drive, and if you are going to drink, take a cab or use a designated driver. Services like Operation Red Nose are available across Canada. There is no excuse. It is common sense, but sadly every year hundreds of Canadians lose their lives in fatal accidents where alcohol was involved.

What are my rights as an English speaker/reader receiving a ticket only in french,canada,"Hi reddit, I recently moved to Quebec. I seem to have gotten a ticket and fines imposed to me for driving. However the document is only in French. Since I initially could not read the document and understand it, I have thought nothing of it. Now the fine has doubled and again sent to me. In French. What are my rights as an English speaker/reader to get a letter that I can actually understand and action accordingly. I tried to use google translate but the document still does not make sense. I've tried calling 'Bureau des infractions et amendes' at 1-877-263-6337 but of course the options are in French. I have since emailed them and now they have provided a translated copy but of course the fines and extra adds on is already there because it's too late because there has been a judgment ruled - in French.

Monthly /r/Canada Photography Contest! - Now with Reddit Gold!,canada,"One of the suggestions we wanted to implement from the /r/Canada census was to have a photography competition.

We will also keep these images for future uses that are such undecided at this time. If for whatever reason you do not want us to retain a copy of the image, we will delete it at your request. Now, we understand that there are some incredibly rare pepes out there – but that is not the type of photography we are looking for. Here are the rules for submissions. 1. You must have taken the photograph yourself. 2. You must have permission to use the photograph you submit. 3. Photographs only. No MS Paint/Photoshop/etc... creations. 4. Leave the original photograph as untouched as possible, that is no added text, overlaid images, etc... 5. Nothing NSFW is allowed. Good luck to all submissions! ",a1zrk9,self.canada,,True

A couple of questions about emotional abuse (aka psychological abuse),canada," This link says: >Emotional abuse happens when a person uses words or actions to control, frighten, isolate, or take away a child's self-respect and sense of worth. Emotional abuse is sometimes called psychological abuse. It can include: putting a child down or humiliating a child constantly criticizing a child constantly yelling at a child threatening to harm a child or others keeping a child from seeing their family or friends without good reason, or threatening to move a child out of their home. >Emotional abuse is serious. Inner wounds can take a long time to heal. >**Some forms of emotional abuse are crimes in Canada, including**: threatening to harm a child threatening to harm another person threatening to destroy the child's personal property threatening to hurt the child's pet harassing the child on the telephone deliberately intimidating a child, and advising a child to commit suicide. >Other forms of emotional abuse are not crimes, but they are still very serious. The provinces and territories also have laws that protect children from emotional abuse. These laws protect children even if the type of abuse is not a crime. Does anyone know how the **non-crimes** are handled? Let's say for example I have a family member that yells constantly at their kid. They don't really do anything else on the list, criminal or not. There is no physical abuse. Does this mean I can't do anything about the situation just because it's not a crime? Or are there other avenues? Thank you.",aan5gd,self.canada,,True

"Preemptive strike - No Quebec is not eliminating English school boards only, it wants to eliminate all school boards, French and English - Before someone pretends this is an attack on the English minority",canada,"The CAQ's predecessor, the ADQ, had expressed since its beginning in the 90's its desire to eliminate school boards and to, instead, send the money directly to the schools. The CAQ's idea is to transform school boards into service centers for the schools. It would remove the decision power from the boards and transfer it to the schools who would now make the decisions. The schools would then seek services that suit their needs from the reformed, former school boards (Service Centers). The rationale is that since a tiny minority of the population bother to vote in school elections (18% for the English and 5% for the French), those boards become refuges for a small group of people for whom school elections are basically nothing more than a 'rubber stamp confirmation' of their posts as trustees. The CAQ figures that the lack of motivation of the people for school elections keeps the competent people away while the same people get elected time and time again... Turning the school boards into organizations run by people who have ran out of ideas a long time ago and who basically run the board out of habit instead of motivation... In usual right-wing fashion, the CAQ believes in reducing the size of bureaucracy and removing the school boards, to them, is analogous to removing the 'middleman'. **I am not saying that I agree or not with this policy or with the government's arguments or rationale...**",a2kc4b,self.canada,,True

Why are Canadian undergrad degrees more major focused than in the USA?,canada,"In the USA it is common (almost universally so) to take 1-2 writing classes. These writing classes are general and not degree specific. In following years you are required to take courses in disciplines outside your major to 'broaden your perspective'. Maybe this liberal arts attitude sounds bullshit to you, but it is common practice in the USA. Esteemed universities like Michigan, Columbia and UCLA all try to provide a well rounded education to their students. Whereas, in Canada, many well known universities do not require any composition or writing class. It is assumed that students come into university prepared to write clearly. However, in my experience this is not the case for many students. Likewise, many well known Canadian universities require little course work outside their major. I even had a Canadian professor tell me that it is 'not a university's job' to teach or help develop critical thinking skills. This same professor told me it is up to parents and the secondary school system to facilitate this.",a9aliu,self.canada,,True

Nous espérons identifier un thème de départ pour lancer la discussion, mais toute discussion en français est bienvenue dans le fil. **Les règles de ce fil sont plutôt simples :** 1. Toutes les règles habituelles du sous-reddit sont toujours en vigueur 2. Essayez d’écrire en français autant que possible, même si votre français est cassé 3. Évitez les discussions de nature politique pour garder l’objectif des conversations à propos de l’utilisation de la langue, et idéalement pas de façon argumentative. Les francophones de langue maternelle et les apprenants potentiels sont encouragés à se joindre à la discussion et à favoriser les apprentissages. Plus tard, nous travaillerons à créer un insigne pour ceux qui facilitent ces discussions pour les y identifier. Ce n’est pas l’endroit pour remettre en question le rôle du français dans la société, du gouvernement ou de la politique canadienne ou pour attaquer les communautés francophones. Le français est parlé par des Canadiens d’un bout à l’autre de notre grand pays et l’intention est ici d’encourager les utilisateurs à développer leurs habiletés linguistiques.

Looking for info on our financial treatment of Natives in Canada.,canada,"While this is a very sensitive issue, I'm am trying to look for info that is as unbiased as possible. Also as close to a forensic audit as possible. It seems the two polarized sides give totally conflicting information. One side says we are not anywhere near what we committed, while the other side says we pay too much, or should stop paying all together. I heard a radio news article the other day, paraphrasing, basically we committed in the 1800s to pay so much to each an every Native each year to do with certain costs. Almost like a rental fee for what I understood. Aparently the amount of $4 a year hasn't changed since 1870s. This is one example where commitments may have not been met. I'm of mixed blood Metis myself. Or as a few pure bloods refer to as a 'White' Indian in a derogatory tone. Or at least it feels derogatory to me. I identify myself for census reasons and am registered with my Metis orginization, but outside of that I don't really identify in day to day life. Hopefully this post can gain some traction. I know it is a very complicated thing I'm asking for, which is even more complicated because there isn't one treaty.

Equalization calculation formula explained...,canada,"**Get ready for some sweet mathematics...** Equalization for a province(E) = Canadian fiscal capacity average(S) - Province's fiscal capacity(F) **E = S - F** where 'S' stands for 'Standard' as in 'Canadian Standard' **Canadian Standard formula** **S = t1B1 + t2B2+ t3B3 + t4B4 + 0.5N** Where: **t1B1** = National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in personal income across all provinces per capita **t2B2 =** National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in business income across all provinces per capita **t3B3 =** National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in consumption expenditure across all provinces per capita **t4B4 =** National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in property value across all provinces per capita **0.5N =** 0.5 (multiplied by) the sum of all natural resource revenues collected by provincial governments expressed on a per capita basis 'S' forms the 'baseline' of the average fiscal capacity in Canada. **Provincial Fiscal capacity formula** **F = t1b1 + t2b2+ t3b3 + t4b4 + 0.5n** **t1b1** = National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in personal income in that province per capita **t2b2 =** National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in business income in that province per capita **t3b3 =** National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in consumption expenditure in that province per capita **t4b4 =** National average provincial tax rate (multiplied by) amount in property value in that province per capita **0.5n =** 0.5 (multiplied by) the sum of all natural resource revenues collected by that provincial government expressed on a per capita basis. **Payment formula** P = (S - F) - A\* - R Where: P = Effective payment in Equalization A\* = Reduction applied with respect to the fiscal capacity cap R = Additional reduction in the payment necessary to keep aggregate payments at the level dictated by the set growth rate. This keeps payment in line with the growth of GDP and prevents Equalization from exceeding growth in GDP. **How does everything come into play?** The effective tax rate in each province is IRRELEVANT... Only the average provincial tax rate across all provinces counts. **Example of calculation:** Taking down some numbers (**Best estimate based on available data**): \- Canada's average personal income per capita is 57,000 \- Canada's average business income per capita is : 11,000 \- Canada's average consumption expenditure per capita is: 25,500 \- Canada's average natural resources revenue per capita is: 8,028 per capita Accounting for an average tax rate in Canada \- Average income tax rate in Canada: 22% \- Average business tax rate is 15% \- Average consumption tax rate is 11% **Calculating the Canadian Standard (S)** S = (0.22\*57000)+(0.15\*11,000)+(0.11\*25,500)+(0.5\*8,208) = **21,099 (Canadian average)** **Alberta** F = (0.22\*59,000)+(0.15\*15,000)+(0.11\*28,300)+(0.5\*15,086) = **24,386 (Alberta's fiscal capacity)** **Quebec** F = (0.22\*47,000)+(0.15\*15,140)+(0.11\*25,403)+(0.5\*7836) = **19,632 (Quebec's fiscal capacity)** **Quebec is below the Canadian average, so it gets Equalization** **Alberta is above the Canadian average, so it doesn't get Equalization** **\*NOTE:** I have not taken into account property values, but since Quebec's is below Alberta's and below the Canadian average (Thanks Vancouver, Thanks Toronto), it would further lower Quebec's fiscal capacity. **Please don't point out individual mistakes, this is a reddit post, not a PHD thesis... The objective here is to explain the mechanics of Equalization and NOT to display exact numbers.** \---------------------------------------------------- **E=S-F formula...** For Alberta = -3,287, a negative number means no Equalization For Quebec = 1,467... **Multiply this by 8.3 million citizens = $12,176,100,000... I am happy I got pretty close to the actual number of $11.732 billion....** **THINGS TO REALIZE** * Nowhere in the Equalization formula are provincial government expenses taken into account. * Nowhere is the formula is the provincial budget taken into account. * Nowhere in the formula is the actual tax rates of a province taken into account except to create the Canadian Standard (Canadian tax average). **The formula is a measure of how well a province fares compared to the Canadian average and how much it needs to rejoin the average.**",a6cb33,self.canada,,True

What is the political rationale for any political party doing anything for Alberta?,canada,"Alberta, these days, is demanding a lot from the federal government. But, I wonder, what is the political or electoral rationale for the Liberals -- or any party for that matter -- to respond positively to Alberta's concerns, legitimate or otherwise? It wouldn't matter what the Liberals, the NDP, or the Conservatives did for Albertans, provincially or federally, because Albertans overwhelming will always choose a Conservative government or elect Conservative MPs. Rachel Notley was an anomaly due to a split in Conservative ranks; she's going to lose in the 2019 election. So, the Liberals can give Albertans everything they want, and they'll still be shut out of Alberta. The Conservatives (as Harper did) can ignore Albertans' demands, and still win most if not all of the seats. So I ask, what is the political rationale for any party to respond to Albertans' concerns?

Can we please talk about Purolator for a minute?,canada,"Hey r/canada, happy holidays! I hope everyone is good health and enjoying their holidays. So, I understand that our mail carriers are under huge amounts of stress and workload at this time of year. Especially so with the strike earlier this year. But I would just like to comment on how Purolator, is a absolute joke of a company. I live in Montreal on one of the busiest well known streets, Rene levesque blvd in a townhouse that is clearly marked, no buzzer on street level. You would literally have to blind to not see it. I ordered a 4 items from amazon last Tuesday (hockey cards, popcorn, an amazon echo and a phone case. For who cares). I paid attention to the whole package tracking as it has Christmas gifts in it, noticed they sent the phone case first through a different delivery service as Amazon was trying to get the other package delivered, and they did on Thursday. I had work off Friday anyway so I made sure I didn’t have to leave the house and I got deep into a book on the couch by my front door. 930 am my phone case showed up through a different delivery service ( who by the way gave me an email notification that my package was 30 minutes away and it was almost perfect in that) Waited around all day, which was no big deal as I planned too and amazon said the package could show up as late as 8pm. At 830 Amazon sent me a notification saying that the driver had been to my house and nobody was home and didn’t want to leave the package unattended. There were no notice slips at mine or any neighbours places. I immediately called both Amazon and Purolator, Amazon of course answered immediately and although were not able to do much, were very helpful and gave me a 5 dollar credit and promised to refund the package if it doesn’t show up on Christmas. I just want to say Amazons customer service is top notch, I don’t want a refund and I wasn’t calling for 5 bucks. I wanted them to know their contracted delivery is lying. So I finally got off hold with Purolator after 30 minutes and again the service rep was very helpful for what he could help with. Told me the driver recorded that he was at my door and then he filed a complaint against the driver saying they would check his gps records and my package will show up on Monday. I also made sure to let him know I wasn’t upset the package didn’t show I was upset I was lied too, you can give me a notice saying they were overwhelmed and were not able to reach me. Well guess what? It’s now Monday and I checked the tracking of the package to now be told that my address does not exist, even though apparently the driver came to my door right? I called and talked to a different rep, asking if this is how they cover for there drivers lying and where my package actually is. They now have zero clue what happened to my package and no guarantee to deliver it. Honestly I hope Amazon charges them for their mess ups, Amazon did their job, Purolator didn’t. Sorry for the rant, and again happy holidays everyone! Edit: Amazon just issued me a full refund, said I can keep the package if it shows. I hope Purolator pays you for their mess ups.

Even better, when you take all the taxes into account, the municipal operating fee, carbon tax, clean energy levy (what the heck is this?) and the GST, they are 170 per cent, almost two times, the actual cost of gas. Don’t you just love the natural gas taxes as well? BC, the province other Provinces want to emulate. These are only the Government taxes. Then you have Fortis and all the costs they put on your bill,eg, admin fee, Transport fee, storage fees the list goes on and on. Bottom line.

"PSA: Vitamin D, Sleep and Winter Blues",canada,"If you are suffering from poor sleeps and depression, it may be a lack of vitamin D. Vitamin D is responsible for helping the body make essential neurotransmitters needed for a calm, happy mood and deep restful sleeps. If you are like me, Vitamin D pills or drops have ZERO effect on this problem despite Health Canada recommending Canadians take during the winter. The good news is however, Sun on our skin solves vitamin D deficiency symptoms. Given the short days and cold weather this time of year, I go to tanning salons and use their Vit D beds which are just tanning beds with bulbs putting our a little more UVB, but any tanning bed works I have found. I cannot underscore how effective this is, even just 5-10 mins 2-3 times a week during the winter months and I feel normal again. I sometimes get busy/lazy and do not go for a week and by the end of that week, my sleep quality is terrible, I am anxious, unable to focus, sad feeling, antisocial and more. All of it goes away immediately after the tan and that evening I have a wonderful sleep again and feel 100% normal the next day. I have been doing this for a few years now and it has literately saved me from loosing my job and has made living in Canada during the winter possible. Not everyone has this issue as those with genes from northern climates tend to have better vit D making abilities in the winter, but for many others, especially those who immigrated from warmer places, tend to really suffer and have no idea why. There is a risk of tanning are well known with plenty of studies warning of skin cancer. This is something I have struggled with as I would rather not expose myself to UV light, but every other method from trying all sorts of different brands/types of vitamin D, high doses of vitamin D, exercise, eating foods with vitamin D and even sleeping pills all to absolutely no effect. My body just does not seem to absorb Vit D when ingested. Sucks, as the effects of Vitamin D deficiency is extreme for me to the point that every aspect of my life suffers. If you can get away with vitamin D pills and exercise, great, if not, you may want to looking into tanning. I am writing this today as I had a friend recently share that they were on anti depressants and really hated how they made them feel plus the high cost. They were already on Vitamin D supplements but were still suffering. I encouraged them to explore tanning and boom, instantly better and no longer needs meds. Makes me wonder how many others are on meds when all they need is Sun. Certainly some people are depressed all year round and no amount of Sun will help, but to test if Sun help, it is about $10 for a one time session at most tanning salons and with a package as low as just a few dollars per session. &#x200B; I hope this post helps some of you. Please pass this along to those in your life that may be suffering from this condition. It is called SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) but for some reason many SAD info sites do not focus on fake tanning for some reason. ",a7dobv,self.canada,,True

Can we establish a strike protocol please.,canada,"I write this as a result of the recent Canada post strike and having been screwed by a parcel that didn't show up on time. It was then that I wondered to myself, why is it that *I'm* getting punished for a strike I have nothing to do with. Shouldn't Canada Post's business be feeling the burn, rather than Canadian citizens? What's more is that there's just a massive backlog that Postal workers have to deal with, so in essence they've created more work for themselves and caused a pain for everyone else during the holiday season. This is just nonsensical. Why wouldn't a striking employee just continue business as usual without charging a customer a fee for doing business? e.g. Postal worker not accepting payment for shipping a parcel. The parcel gets shipped anyway, forcing Canada Post to burn through money much faster. This would undoubtedly force negotiations much quicker without effecting operations.

And love him or hate him if you’re ever so slightly a sports fan you have likely listened to the man rant or at least checked in to see what eccentric suit he’s wearing. But I think the question needs to be asked: Who should replace the man? In my personal opinion I’m think Kevin Bieksa should at least be in the running, maybe P.K. Subban when he retires? I just think we need someone who provides quality entertainment, a flair for the outrageous/dramatic, and a good knowledge of hockey. Please anyone but George Stromboulopoulos!",a7izsa,self.canada,,True

TRAVEL ADVICE: Is driving in Canada/Rockies without winter snow tyres doable? (hire car),canada,"My partner and I are looking at booking a hire car in the first week of January to travel from Calgary Banff Lake Louise Jasper Kamloops. We have driven on freezing/snowy roads before but are having a hard time finding a hire car that has winter tyres on it. Is this a route that is possible with regular all seasons tyres? The other option would be looking at bus options, though the Jasper Kamloops journey seems the hardest to link up – it looks like we will still need a combination of car bus link ups or fork out a hefty fee for internal flights which will cost a lot more time and money. Alternatively, if we were to use bus as much as possible and only drive to link the gaps, would a service such as zip car work the same / be a better choice than hiring a car for a single day?

I really wanted to live downtown and I can afford the rent. I have given everything under the sun to those landlords in my application but they keep rejecting me (which I’m pretty sure is either because I’m new hère or my nationality). On one hand I understand, because they want to make sure the tenant is AAA (as they say) on the other hand it is discrimination. I’m actually a guy with good credit and a well paying job. I wonder what refugees or new comers who couldn’t find a well paying job go through. P.S: I know it’s against law to discriminate against newcomers. I’m not gonna be litigating this though. P.P.S. Actually for all of you keep saying they have 100 offers and I just get rejected because I’m just not first or something. That’s not the case because most of them were in the market for days before I applied. Some even a month. They even had reduced prices for some of the units to get more people to apply. It’s 100% not about just money or overwhelming demand. They are looking for a certain profile and not willing to rent out for others. ",a3za54,self.canada,,True

Is the Biggest Problem That Anti-Oil Protestors Face Actually Their Own Hypocrisy?,canada,"I am referring to all the products that we all depend on oil to have made. Not all of them can be made from other materials, certainly. And demand for them will only increase.  a list of 144 products that would be affected if oil demand wasn't met. The businesses that protestors may run: They will need oil products. The transportation means which they may operate: Regardless of fuel type, they will need oil products. The computers on which they would spout anti-oil sentiments: They all need oil products. This would include the entire internet. Fact is, every aspect of our day-to-day life requires oil products for us to function as a society now. From toothbrushes to phones to refrigerators to deodorant to dishes to clothes. No, we can't go back because it means to going back to using materials that are far more scarce, or are just impossible to make with other materials. So why are we protesting against the production and distribution of oil products? At most, the wasteful burning of it for fuel needs looking at, as that can reasonably be replaced, eventually. But oil in itself? Demand for it will likely never cease, but will only increase. This is just a reasonable take, imho. But maybe someone can change my mind. Thanks.",a90icd,self.canada,,True

"Thank-you Canada, for saving my life with free healthcare.",canada,"We all pay taxes, we are all responsible for funding other people's healthcare and our own. I guess I just realized how grateful I am for free healthcare. I'll keep his brief but basically I was suicidal and poor as hell. My parents are immigrants and we have no money in the family, and BOTH my parents lost their jobs. My boyfriend was able to get me to the hospital for treatment, I stayed a week and was out feeling so much better. I don't know what I would've done if I had to pay for all that. I'm scared to think about it, I would've had no where to go and would've killed myself. Again, when I was younger I had an ectopic pregnancy. The pain was unreal, and I just assumed it was the shits, but went to emergency anyways just to be safe and to get tests done since I was home alone and didn't feel too safe. By the time the tests the pain were done the pain had subsided...but I was internally bleeding with non existent blood pressure I was OUT. I had meds then surgery the next few hours, stayed 2 nights in hospital and ubered back home, biggest expense was the Uber. I wouldn't have gone if I had to pay thousands of dollars, again I definitely would be dead. I would've passed out in the bathroom or some thing... So thank you Canada. Thank-you for free healthcare. Thank-you everyone for paying taxes. Thank-you for saving my life. Edit: Okay, I get it it's not free. ",abaofy,self.canada,,True

Describe your Canada road trips,canada,"For me the only 'big' road trip I've been on was with my mother, sister and grandparents 6 years ago. Started in Moncton, went to Fredericton to see family for a day and then drove through Quebec City because my grandparents were too nervous to venture into the busy cities (they live in the country, they're not used to traffic in any sized city). Drove through Montreal and to some sort of 'resort' in the middle of nowhere with a pool (was fun for me and my sister back then), stayed there for a few nights. Then onward to Ottawa where we spent a day checking out the Parliament and the Canadian Mint. Next day we stopped in Trenton to see some family and moved on to Niagara Falls just driving through Toronto, again grandparents wanted to avoid city traffic, especially in Toronto lol and then we finished our trip in Marineland and basically drove all the way back to Moncton without doing too much on the way back, other than stopping in small towns my grandparents heard about from friends haha. So not the most eventful road trip but it was enjoyable at the time. Really interested in hearing about your road trips as a kid or an adult. I'm thinking of doing a road trip this summer to Alberta to and I want to check out a bunch of National/Provincial parks so maybe I can get some ideas from your stories :).",aabn8q,self.canada,,True

There are good things and bad things about each one.

French Education: Love it or hate it?,canada,"Hey there Canada. French class is a bit of a touchy subject. The younger my students are, the more they love learning the French language. That love for le français tends flat-line as they approach high school. I would love to know what made French class a positive or negative experience for you. Did your French teacher put you off of learning French? Did you stop because your friends/siblings/relatives didn't continue either? Do you regret discontinuing your French education? As a Canadian, would being proficient in French be a benefit to your current/future/desired career? I've often heard from friends, acquaintances, customers I've served over 7 years in retail, that many people regret not pursuing French. Of course, there are many that are completely content with their decision, however those who have regrets have been the most vocal in my experience. I would love to hear your experiences in what many people have both loved and hated, French class. I've set up a Google Form to formally document the information. You do not need to log in to Google and no information will be collected other than your responses.  I am hoping to use this information to better shape my practice and provide a more enjoyable experience for all of my students. Thank you!",a2jryt,self.canada,,True

Canada Post should be privatized in my opinion for the following reasons. 1) price - this monopoly had no stake in providing cost savings to customers, if we opened the market up to competitors we would as has been proven in Austria and Germany see our postal rates drop significantly 2) Labour actions - in the past 46 years CUPW or some form of the union has been on strike 20 times, this is an unacceptable amount of times and with the union continually holding the customer hostage as we have no other choice on who we choose to deliver our letter mail it is well past time for Canadians to stand up for ourselves and demand a better and varied postal options. It’s time to privatize, and this strike has proven that CUPW members care nothing for the average mail sending/receiving Canadian as this whole strike reeks of opportunism (OCS roll out and rotating strike aimed at disrupting the Christmas season and the continued slow down by postal employees) ",a72k9r,self.canada,,True

What is the least biased Canadian news source?,canada,I'm looking for an online Canadian news source but have concerns about political or big business bias in the reporting. Maybe I'm paranoid because of what I see in the U.S. with Fox News but I'll feel better getting some input from the hive mind. I'll of course do some follow-up research as I'm also paranoid enough to assume nefarious states or organizations will be seeding comments to push me to their biased news. Later I'll also be asking for tinfoil recommendations. I won't want to make my hat from faulty foil. Thank you in advance for your comments. P.S. I will also be happy to pay for access to this least biased news source. I'd like to support them.,a6ozp4,self.canada,,True

So basically in the same amount of time it takes to drive from the east coast of Canada to the west coast you can basically drive through 9 countries in Europe. To me that's insane haha.

What’s winter like in your part of Canada?,canada,"This sub seems to be mostly for news stories but I’m curious if anyone wants to discuss this! :) I’m super interested in learning more about what winter is like in other parts of Canada... what it’s *really like*, how people feel and experience it, not just what the numbers on some weather data charts can tell you. I’m curious about things like... how often does Quebec get too cold for your kids to play outside? How good is the city of Fredericton at keeping sidewalks clear? How easy or hard is winter driving in snowy mountainous areas like Castlegar or Prince George? How does it feel when Calgary gets a chinook, do you get uplifted by the warm weather or do you just get frustrated from sweating to death in the winter boots you mistakenly wore to work? How does winter feel on the Atlantic, they say humidity makes cold feel worse but what does it actually feel like to you? The only places I’ve lived are Edmonton and Vancouver, and I’ll be honest, the reason that I’m curious about this is because I want to know what winter is like in places that aren’t the two extreme ends of the spectrum. I’ve lived in “there is no winter, just rain” and I’ve lived in “it’s been below -25 for weeks and kids aren’t even allowed to play outside due to frostbite” but nothing in between. I’m wondering what it’s like to live in a place that has the kind of Canada that we grew up seeing in children’s books and TV and movies- where people sit on the front porch in a chunky scarf and wool coat drinking hot cocoa while watching the kids play street hockey. I want to know where people get the cute storybook winter where it’s cold enough for snow and ice, but not so cold that everyone’s forced to go hide indoors. And I want to know if those places with “medium winters” actually are the rustic Canadian winter experience that I picture them to be - or if I’m being unrealistic and they’re full of slippery sidewalks and car accidents and poor lighting and getting so much snow that you can’t leave your house (I’ve been told that New Brunswick is like this, but the guy who told me this was a bit of a one-upper so he might have been trying to impress people...). Positive and negative stories are welcome ;) Really I just want to hear stories of what it’s like growing up and going about daily life, in winter, in different parts of Canada.

I also live in one of the poorest and higher crime areas of the the city - the West End, just west of downtown, north of Portage Avenue. Even here, it's not remotely like that. I've been here over 10 years, I'm married with kids, we walk around all the time, and although violent crime sometimes happens, street crime where the perpetrator doesn't know the victim is pretty rare. Crime is mostly between idiots who know each other. The worst we've experienced is a stolen BBQ, and a smashed car window. Am I missing something in other major cities?

What do REAL Canadians actually think about the Huawei/China issues?,canada,"I'm Canadian and I'll be the first to admit that I'm not too into politics, for reasons I won't get into, but it's good to know what the hell is going on in the world. I recently came accross this youtube  in these videos are condemning us. Meanwhile, the people I've talked to, IRL, don't seem to share this opinion. Far be it for me to care what youtube comments say but it got me wondering if this is just more paid pro-China propaganda. IMO... we have an extradition treaty with the US. They issued an arrest warrent and we honoured that treaty. End of story. That's not even getting into how it seems most people don't understand how interwoven Huawei is with the communist party in China. Huawei is one of the largest companies in China and large companies like that would literally get nowhere without the backing of the CPC. Meng Wanzhou had 5 passports, ffs. That kind of thing isn't possible for 'innocent' regular business people. That's some Bourne shit. The thought of China-backed Huawei 5G infrastructure in Canada is personally very scary as well. Australia, Japan, etc, apparently feel the same. Obviously nothing will eliminate government spying but I'd rather have Canada be able to spy on us, than giving China a backdoor into our network. I wanted to ask this question here, where I can hear from actual fellow Canadians...

What's your favorite city in Canada to live and why?,canada,"Just a fun question I was thinking of. For me I live in Moncton, New Brunswick and I haven't traveled much in Canada yet but I plan to. Though I can't speak from personal experience I feel like Calgary would be my favorite city to live in, in Canada. I love mountains, hiking and scenery which makes Calgary the obvious choice because with 2 hours of driving to the west you have Yoho and Banff and with an additional 2 hours Jasper. 3 hours to the south near the US boader is also writing-on-stone provincial park and Waterton. Also Calgary is in decent proximity of even more national parks in the US which would make for good road trips as well in Oregon, Washington, California, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, etc. Calgary also has the 3rd largest airport in Canada tied with Montreal (depends on the source) which offers more flights at better prices which is especially beneficial for me because I know I'm going to travel a lot in my 20s because I'm interested in long term backpacking. Negatives to living in Calgary are that it's expensive compared to where I am right now. So what's your favorite city to live in? Keep it respectful :)",aaeczx,self.canada,,True

"For first time in a decade, Ontario denied an equalization payment after losing have-not status. Ontario Finance Minister calls for equalization process review.",canada,,a4wpyq,nationalpost.com,,False
Equalization Protests From Alberta,canada," Canada’s equalization payments have to be the biggest scam ever. Basically money given to provinces (2/3 to Quebec) with no strings attached. Several years ago, Ontario (a supposedly “have” province) had to Institute a Healthcare premium (basically an income tax increase) of up to $900 per year, while Quebec (a supposedly “have not” province) was giving its residents a $600 per year tax cut, while still receiving equalization payments. If Quebec had so much money that they could afford a tax cut, why the heck were they still getting equalization payments? Equalization is why they can keep their Hydro rates low. This year Alberta is running a deficit, Quebec a surplus, guess whose getting $13 billion! Seriously I have no problem with equalization payments, but they should come with stringent conditions (much like the US highway funding for states. That’s the reason why US legal drinking age is 21, it’s a condition all states receiving federal highway funding must accept. Louisiana lowered the age to 18, as they estimated they’d gain more in alcohol taxes than they’d lose in federal highway funding). A requirement to celebrate Canada Day would be a good start. Another would be payment reduction to match any loss in revenue from tax cuts. If you can afford to reduce taxes, you can afford to get less in equalization payments. For every $1 in tax cuts, you lose $1 in equalization payments. Or best yet, stop the equalization scam and use the money to pay down Canadian debt. At $14 billion a year will take 100 years, but it’s a start. ",a5ilzs,self.canada,,True

Why is Kraft Dinner so terrible now?,canada,"For about the last year I have noticed that Kraft Dinner doesn't taste the same as it used to. For a while I just thought I had gotten a few boxes that had gone bad, but this can't be the case. The noodles are thin, stringy, and fall apart when boiling and the water gets all white and starchy. The sauce smells rancid and is a weird color. When mixing the noodles, milk, butter, and sauce it all sticks together in a congealed goopy mass. The taste is the worst part though. It's bland, doesn't taste like cheese, and becomes a paste in your mouth that doesn't even require chewing. My grandma was in the states a while ago and brought back some American Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner. She gave me a box and it tasted like the KD of our childhood. Cue the nostalgia flashbacks. The noodles were firm, the color was orange, and the flavor was spot on. This proved to me that I wasn't crazy and that KD is horrendous now. Has anyone else noticed that KD is inedible now? TLDR: KD changed their recipe and it's gross now, commiserate with me. ",a3hio4,self.canada,,True
