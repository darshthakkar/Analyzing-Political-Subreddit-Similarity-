"the severity of brexit, and the BoE's forcast",unitedkingdom,"as we know, the Bank of England has issued a forecast in regard to the economic impact of a no deal brexit. with an expected reccession, and the pound falling past parrity of the USD, just how massive, how major, would that truly be? ---- first, lets deal with the expected recession. the harsh reality is, we're the ONLY country to still be even feeling a slight bit of an effect from the 2008 recession. the US started to fully recover (as in, GDP of debt per household becoming a net positive) around 2013, europe too. asia, and especially japan, were lucky in the fact they were rather closed off from the effects, and they also have a massive export market towards those countries that were affected. that in itself should make your blood boil. but not for our government, clearly. they see it as a way to get rich quick while leaving the rest of us to rot in the mess they helped to flourish. next, the topic of the pound dropping past parity. the last time the pound got close to this, was during 1984-1985. that's right, thatcher and the miners strike. year open for 1984 was 1.34:1 GBP/USD. year end, during the middle of the strike? 1.16:1, dropping to 1.15:1 for the 1985 opening. during the peak, or rather, the trough of how low the value of the pound got, was 1.05:1 GBP/USD. that's a very long winded way to say: the pound, since becoming a decimal currency, has NEVER been under parity with the US$. the idea that the sterling can rise by 5% if may's deal would get accepted is for a very simple reason - money hates uncertainty. if they had any plan, at all, the economy would raise. ---- this is ignoring the other, MAJOR, factors in the british economy, such as housing, unemployment, more commercial businesses shutting down, or even the brain drain of citizens leaving the country for better pastures. if you seriously can't understand how fucked we are, and have lived through thatcher, go to a psychiatrist because you need help. ---- ",a21hx7,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Is there anyone in the know with information on the tenants fees ban?,unitedkingdom,"I am horrified that the agents that seem to have the best properties for us (around Streatham, London) are looking to charge us about £550-600 just for fees, plus up to £160 for an **unfurnished inventory check** (shout out to Barnard Marcus for trying to push me to viewings when I just wanted to get those numbers). As we only manage to save around £100-200 a month, they are the whole reason we are moving in March and not right now. I have been an agent myself and know how little goes in to most of these 'services' they are charging for. &#x200B; From what I have read they are due to come in in 'Spring 2019'. Our move in date is March 1st, which is near enough the start of Spring, as this is when we will have all the money together (we are also checking Openrent but the properties are few and far between at £1000pcm). I am wondering if we should wait a month or two or just suck it up.

Whether it be via email, phone call or even hand-written letters.

UK govemrents response to Article 13:,unitedkingdom,"If you signed this petition for the UK to repeal articles 11 and 13, then I have some...interesting news for you; here is the UK governments response to said petition: =================================================================================================== 'The EU Copyright Directive is still being negotiated and the UK is a full and active participant in these negotiations as part of the Council of the EU. The Council and the European Parliament are between them negotiating the final version of the text. The Government supports the aims of the Directive, including Article 11 – a new right for press publishers – and Article 13 – new rules to ensure copyright owners can claim payment when their content is uploaded to platforms like YouTube without their permission. However, it is important to the Government that these proposals are balanced, take into account the need to protect freedom of expression, and avoid placing unreasonable burdens on businesses and internet users. Because of this the Government has actively sought safeguards for freedom of expression, such as rules which will protect people’s ability to use third party content for the purpose of quotation, parody, and similar purposes which are currently allowed under UK law. The Government’s support for the Directive, and its position on implementing and maintaining these provisions following the UK’s exit from the EU, will depend on the outcome of the negotiations on the Directive. The Government will continue to engage in these negotiations to ensure the best outcome for the UK. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy' So in my personal opinion: this is eh news: it's not really a suprise that the UK government supports articles 11 and 13, considering the two largest political parties (labour and conservative) voted in favour of the copyright directive back in September of this year. It's also not a big surprise that we could see this article 11 and 13 even after Brexit because the UK's music industry are some of biggest lobby's pushing for this directive. However, for what it's worth; the government also says that any current safeguards under U.K. Law will still apply which remember: it's a copyright DIRECTIVE not law: it's up to member states how they implement them. Though this could just be seen as 'excess fluff' the 'we'll see' response. Also, the intent of article 13 was never the issue; it was what companies would have to do in order to comply. In conclusion: While this is disheartening, I'm not personally surprised and at least they've said they won't let it effect current fair use/dealing...for all that's worth.",a7zsq5,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Roughly 10% of the seats. So if there isn't a deal approved by parliament, and politicians aren't insane enough to leave without a deal, where would that leave us? We could potentially all on one day vote on: 1. The Brexit Deal 2. European Parliament Elections 3. Local Elections 4.

I have made a template for you to write/email to your MP about a second referendum.,unitedkingdom,"I understand it can be a touchy subject. Whether you are Leave or Remain, it is in your best interest to let your know your view. Make your voice heard. To find out your constituency and MP's name, go to (Write to them)[ and type your postcode. I have included the template below. Please feel free to edit as you see fit. Dear [INSERT MP], I am writing to you to express my support for a so-called People's Vote. As a resident of [CONSTITUENCY OF RESIDENCE], I am imploring you to lend your support in the House of Commons for a second referendum. Whilst I appreciate there was a referendum in 2016, it would be incorrect to say “it is against democracy” to ask for another referendum now that more information has come to light. It would be similar to not reconsidering a verdict once new evidence has come to light. I believe the facts have changed and whether or not the views of the public have changed, it is the responsibility of our representative to ensure our views are fully represented. I believe you are doing the utmost possible to respect the wishes of the electorate and do what is best for this constituency. However I will have no choice but to vote against your party and you if you cannot lend your support to ensure the British people's views are correctly represented in our Parliament. I hope I can count on your support. While this may be a template, it is simply to ensure any one who wants to send a similar message to their Member of Parliament can do so with ease. I hope you do not take offence. Thank you. Yours sincerely, [YOUR NAME] [YOUR ADDRESS]",a5g4c2,self.unitedkingdom,,True

"A policeman from the States, a policeman from Brazil and a policeman from Britain are told to go into a forest and find a nuisance rabbit...",unitedkingdom,"The policeman from the States goes first. He makes a few friendly conversations and when realising the importance of the situation, promptly engages in an extensive study of the forest in precise detail over a fairly long length of time, disturbed only by a moment when an escalation ensues and it transpires that one particular rabbit was unjustifiably shot, due to claims of it looking threatening and also being harder to see at that time. Eventually he concludes that he is unable to find the rabbit, citing evidence against the rabbit ever being responsible or him having had enough information to reveal the culprit, admits he can't do anything to improve the situation and after a few whinges, everyone begrudgingly goes back to their daily activities. The policeman from Brazil makes a few friendly conversations, and when realising the importance of the situation, announces that he will assemble a squad to violently search the forest and investigate all possible methods of cover. The forest is razed down to clear the entire area, revealing that either the rabbit was long gone, or is now dead or burnt. They then simply make way for logging companies, some other rabbits in the area are forced out or shot, they get their payout and admit they failed to find or capture the rabbit or it's body and everyone shrugs depressingly and gets back to what they are doing. The British policeman stands at the edge of the forest, makes a few friendly conversations and when realising the importance of the situation, mutters that he needs to get back to the station to prepare an investigation. He puts up some tape, returns with a few other coppers who stand with him at the side of the now perfectly cleared forest area, rubbing their chins vigorously in an effort to look important. Eventually they go into the area, ransack a warren and bring out two local working-class rabbits, who, it transpired, had nothing to do with the bastard. They return to the station where they receive a phone call from the press asking them whether there really is a nuisance rabbit. They respond: 'Although we are not sure when we will conclude our efforts, we would like to ensure all those concerned that we are doing everything we can, and we are sure will find the rabbit responsible in due time'. It is pointed out that the area is clear, there are no more warrens, and no rabbit can be seen. 'There may be a possibility that the rabbit does not exist' Then, they are asked why they are sure that they can find the rabbit.

Delaying the vote and holding the country to ransom with threats of a hard Brexit because your party is caught up in its incessant internal bickering is undermining democracy.

Questions on timing for a general election,unitedkingdom,"I have a hypothetical scenario I'd appreciate comments on: May has said week of the 14th Jan for her deal to be voted on. Let's say she goes full lastminute.com and that means Friday 18th Jan. She loses, Corbyn immediately tables a no-confidence motion. May loses that too. Per the fixed term Parliament Act, there's 14 days for someone else to form a new government. So now it's Friday 1st Feb. Nobody forms a government, so the UK heads off to a general election. But when? All I can find says the Queen announces a date based on advice from the PM. Could May tell the Queen to hold the vote after Brexit day? As I understand it, there must be at least 25 working days between dissolution of Parliament and an election, and convention is to hold the vote on a Thurs. By my reckoning, that would put the general election on Thurs 14th March 2019, assuming the above scenario plays out. That leaves just two weeks before Brexit day for a new government to sort something out (assuming of course the result isn't a hung Parliament that eats more days as parties try to form a government). Surely Corbyn has to table a motion of no confidence sooner than the vote on May's deal, just to leave himself time should he get into office?",a766f5,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Boris Johnson: 20 Reasons To Be Cheerful,unitedkingdom," 1. Contrary to popular belief, global poverty is not rising but falling, and this year saw the astonishing moment when the number of people classed as middle class – having fridges, washing machines and other big consumer durables, as well as money to spend on leisure – reached parity with the poor and disadvantaged. There are now roughly 3.8 billion richer, or middle-class, people, and about 3.8 billion poor and disadvantaged. By 2040 the middle classes will form the vast majority as a further 900 million are expected to be lifted out of poverty. That is great news for Britain because the booming middle classes, especially in Asia, will be big consumers of our goods and services. 2. Some of the world’s nastiest wars have somewhat abated. The rate of killing has slowed in Syria and there is more than a glimmer of hope in Yemen. 3. In the past few years we have actually seen a big fall in global terrorism – with a 27 per cent reduction in deaths from terrorism last year on 2016, which was itself down on the year before that. Of course, one terrorist crime is one too many, but the global numbers are going, for now, in the right direction. 4. We have been going through a long period in which there have been only tiny numbers of UK troops killed on active service abroad, in spite of our many global commitments. 5. Not every wild animal is doomed to a tragic decline in numbers. Thanks to conservation efforts the number of tigers in India has risen by 20 per cent. The Chinese are successfully protecting their pandas. Otters have returned to some English rivers. 6. We are seeing a real boom in electric vehicles, which is cutting CO2 and reducing pollution in urban areas. Partly thanks to the efforts of the previous mayor, London is suddenly awash with good-looking electric taxis. 7. Smoking is increasingly unfashionable, especially among young people. Whatever the disadvantages of vaping it would seem to be nothing like as harmful. 8. Aids remains a dreadful killer, but the number of victims in Africa is well down, offering grounds for hope. 9. England has a young and match-winning football team that did everyone proud in the World Cup, with the promise of more success to come. 10. The UK is unlike many other places in Europe in that we don’t have any kind of Right-wing populist party or movement. There is currently no sign of a resurgence by Ukip, provided of course, that the present Government delivers on Brexit. 11. People are living longer and enjoying active and fulfilling retirements in numbers unimaginable to previous generations. 12. The UK staged a highly successful Commonwealth summit this year – and more Commonwealth countries, above all India, are following this country’s example in enacting laws insisting on LGBT equality and progress. 13. Half of the top 10 globally bestselling pop and rock music albums this year were by British artists, making this country the number one music superpower on earth. We hail the Arctic Monkeys, Dua Lipa, George Ezra, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and we note that the Spice Girls are doing a reunion tour. 14. Meghan Markle has provided a lot of zing and excitement to the Royal family. 15. The BBC’s Blue Planet series has helped to raise global consciousness about the effects of plastic pollution in our seas. The pressure is now on to ban single-use plastics around the world. 16. The last attempt at Project Fear has proved spectacularly wrong, as unemployment has not risen by 500,000 since the 2016 referendum – as predicted by the Government – but fallen to the lowest levels since 1972. 17. After a 30-year decline, for which all political parties should hang their heads in shame, the number of young people owning their own homes in Britain is finally on the rise. 18. This country is leading the world in protecting marine wildlife with almost four million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) of oceans designated as sanctuaries, including swathes of Antarctica. A third of the world’s emperor penguins are UK citizens. 19. British exports are now running at 30 per cent of GDP for the first time in a generation. They include a boom in the sales of some of the almost 700 types of British cheese, notably Stilton, for which there appears to be an almost insatiable demand, especially among middle-class Asian populations. 20. The Cabinet appears to be increasingly sanguine and relaxed about the possibility of leaving the EU on WTO terms, so allowing for new free trade deals, cheaper food imports and even more cheese exports.

Crisis support lines with SMS numbers or social media chat? (probably a Trigger Warning),unitedkingdom,"I am not in any crisis, nor am I aware of anyone in immediate danger. This is just curiosity. It's 2018 and I can hardly find any crisis support helplines that accept text messages, or who you can chat to on social media. By crisis support lines I'm talking about ChildLine, Rape Crisis, the Samaritans... numbers that you might call in a crisis when you aren't ready to get the police involved yet. The only UK one I've found is , a suicide prevention helpline for people under 35 who you can send a text to. I've never had to use one of these services, but if I was in a place where I had to reach out, talking to a person on the phone is the last thing I'd want to do. Texting is a much easier way of communicating for a lot of people, particularly young people. I'm not asking out of criticism, I'm asking because I'm a software developer and this is something I could help build, because I'm aware that these are voluntary organisations. But if I can text my bank and take out a loan, then I should be able to text a crisis charity when I'm in need. Even if it's just to break the ice, and the counsellor at the other end will eventually ask to call me. It seems to me like that should totally be a thing that we do. Unless there's something I'm missing. Is this even a service that crisis helplines want? Would they be able to staff it etc? Why haven't they done this already?",a72wwv,self.unitedkingdom,,True

And then on the return journey board a bus at a train station, to be taken to a different train station again! So my question is, is the bus journey included in the train fair, or do I have to pay as I board? I'm assuming that the train station has it's own bus station where you change over.

France is going the same way as Britain in many ways. There are major disparities between Euro members. Everything going on in Ukraine was partly a result of an experiment gone wrong in EU international politics. The very real migrant crisis caused by leaders decisions was likely one of the biggest causes of Leave winning the vote. The leaders of the EU nations do need to consider giving concessions and admitting they don't have all the answers. The four freedoms are clearly not popular in their current form. Are there any others feeling the same? I just feel like the EU may have gone too far in a few places and could at least make concessions there. ,a3poc3,self.unitedkingdom,,True

This Brexit deal May is trying to win support for..,unitedkingdom,"I'm always talking political, whether it'd be on here or in real life, but for the first time I'm unable to understand May's deal. A ton of people hate it, and from what I can hear, as a Remainer myself, this is a Remainer-deal, which probably means a soft Brexit, which would at least be avoiding the Hardest of Brexits. The problem is though, I doubt we'll get a soft Brexit because of how much opposition is building up in parliament against this deal. Could somebody explain why it's became such a controversial deal, when, from my perspective, fellow remainers should be happy with it since its pretty much favouring a softer Brexit? Sorry if this has became a repetitive question on this subreddit, by the way. A ton of online sources/media don't simplify it enough for me to be able to make a full on judgement on it. As it stands for me at the moment, I've been told by people online that I should be happy with it as it's pretty much a Brexit in name only, so to speak. If we really are leaving in name only, hopefully meaning we retain pretty much the same deal we've got as our membership, then that'll be good enough for me.",a22c2p,self.unitedkingdom,,True

UK couple cleared of Gatwick fiasco,unitedkingdom," *'The setback to the investigation followed a series of newspaper reports naming those arrested as 47-year-old Paul Gait, a window fitter, and his 54-year-old wife, Elaine Kirk, from Crawley, three miles south of Gatwick.'* *'They were released after 36 hours of questioning. Their friends expressed dismay that the couple had been arrested in the first place.'* *'Their pictures appeared on a number of Sunday newspaper front pages, one of which asked: “Are these the morons who ruined Christmas?” The television presenter Piers Morgan apologised after describing the pair as “clowns” in a tweet and said the situation was a fiasco.'* I find the above shocking and scary taking that in the UK the presumption is that you're innocent until proven guilty etc. I imagine my parents or myself arrested and leaked to the paper (likley for personal gain?). Arrested based on a total lack of real evidence vs the wealth of alibis and positive character. It seems like they were persecuted for being one of many who understandably complained about the airport pollution and used as a scapegoat by pressured police...and at Christmas time. **Can and should the above unfortunate pair take legal action ?** against the police and media after the horrific way they've been treated. Including the slander and libel from celebs who effectively profit from misinformation by rubbishing their reputations publically during entertainment mediums which they're financially benefiting from etc. **Update:**  Looks like all the upset was for nothing and there was no bloody drones. But now anti drone laws are being rushed through. Anyone who downvoted this should be ashamed, as it's been a huge scam with temp. scapegoats. Mission accomplished.

So there was me and feckin Theresa May trying to figure out what to offer him, and then he says 'if you apologize on behalf of your country for being tits then I'll spare you'. Theresa waited until there was 1 second left on his countdown before she agreed. I was shitting myself.

"Remain needs to propose a new, positive narrative",unitedkingdom,"This is a discussion I've been having for a while now, and I'm surprised Remainers aren't jumping at the opportunity for a positive discourse, choosing instead to just argue the same points that failed in the 2016 referendum. Remain's unique selling proposition cannot be that Britain should just continue to be a passive member of the EU. If the British are going to stay, Remainers have to propose Britain as a country that will make full use of the rest of the EU as a resource, as a pathway to untold success. The UK are best placed to do this, because – for a start – the rest of the EU already speaks English. And not just a bit. It is already the case that universities in the EU offer entire degrees taught in the English language. You can study, say, economics at Maastricht University, or at Köln, or at Leuven, and not speak a word of Dutch, German or Flemish. You can study fashion at the best academies in Milan and not speak a word of Italian. I generally advocate for small government, but there's one mistake I think the UK made in the 80s. France spent colossal amounts of money back then on its ministry of culture, and especially on its film development programme. They got very little bang for their buck, but it did work: there were thousands of people buying property in Provence after films like Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources came out. The programme for Italy back in the 70s was even more value for money. It boosted Italian exports immensely. There isn't a single kitchen cupboard in the rest of Europe that doesn't contain a product made in Italy, and Italian clothes, shoes, cars, motorbikes, etc. are sold on a cultural image that was created back then. Britain never went for such a programme, when it could have achieved success levels 100x those of Italy. The world already watches American movies and American TV. Everyone already speaks English. The UK could be a European powerhouse of cultural output. And, as we know, whoever controls the cultural output nowadays, controls the mindset. Europe could be your playground, and you won't take it because you're looking at this with the mindset of the underdog rather than the top dog. So, if you're going to advocate Remain, stop arguing the same points, stop alienating Brexiteers with your jeers. Stop telling them they're ignorant, and start offering them a positive picture of the potential. /end rant.",a5900r,self.unitedkingdom,,True

A second change might to have directly elected government ministers, accountable not to the party, but to the people. No more handing out political posts as favours. No more disinterested, ill-equipped and occasionally incompetent people in charge.

HMRC - Appealing late charges,unitedkingdom,"Hi all, I am hoping someone on here, hopefully a friendly someone employed by HMRC, can give me some advise in appealing a tax decision. I know about the procedure for appealing but I want to make sure I do it right and I would like to hear from you folk if I am justified. Let me regale you with a tale: My tax did not match up for the year's 2013/14 and 2014/15. This was all down to a temping agency not providing the correct tax information and also not getting taxed for doing 2 days work at a printing company, which I still don't understand. So HMRC sent to me a couple of tax returns to complete, but I never got them as I was living in Kent at the time and they had no change of address.. even though I was registered to a new address and a new workplace. I am from Leeds originally. If you don't complete your tax returns on time they start charging you late fees. On the website it states 'You’ll get a penalty of £100 if your tax return is up to 3 months late. You’ll have to pay more if it’s later, or if you pay your tax bill late. You’ll also be charged interest on late payments.' And honestly, I think they just pluck the numbers at random.. Anyway, after Kent I returned to Leeds about a year and a half later and was greeted with a letter saying I owed £200. So I called them and they convinced me to just pay it, so I did. I thought that was the end of it and was they gave me no reason to believe otherwise. Then a YEAR later I get letters, PLURAL, saying I owe around £3.3k, explaining I still need to send my tax returns and the £3.3k is late charges. Again, I am sure they pluck the numbers at random because I requested a break down at one point and it's listed as 97, 300, 5.50, 300, 900, 16.51, 300, etc etc etc.. &#x200B; I got into a bitter back and forth with them, trying to appeal, sending evidence of employment in Kent, sending dated letters with covering letters. I used everything I had but they kept telling me they refused to acknowledge an appeal until the tax returns were complete. So I eventually got my tax returns in and thought that was the end of it. I never received confirmation of receipt of my tax returns. I never heard anything again about the £3.3k. &#x200B; I was told at the time, during the back and forth, that if they wanted to take the £3.3k from me they would take those late fees over whatever course of time it takes, via my PAYE tax. But they did not say anything about going ahead with it once my returns were complete. Neither did I receive acknowledgement of my appeal letters, leaving me to assume they had been accepted. &#x200B; In April of this year my current job, but by June it seems my tax code had changed to something like 496L and behold, I am being over taxed. It is my fault for not noticing this sooner I admit.. the payslip system is long winded here so I just left checking for a while. I only realised there was an odd PAYE code attached to me a few weeks ago. I called them last week and thats when they confirmed that's why I was being charged. It sounded, from what the guy at HMRC was telling. would likely be an excess of a thousand a year extra tax. &#x200B; And here we are. I am a bit stressed as you can imagine and I want to sort it out somehow because I've been told by numerous folk at HMRC that I could appeal.. but I bet they just wanted me off the phone. I am going to appeal like usual, write a cover letter, throw all manner of dated evidence at them.. But I was hoping to get some more ammunition from other people. &#x200B; If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read.",a5sdbz,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Now I know I’ve said Gatwick and I completely comprehend that people are going to quickly say that “it’s an act of god” that a drone ruined so many flights and that it’s not the airlines fault BUT that’s not the case here... The reason the flight got delayed was because of a technical issue with the plane. (Pilot confirmed this) The initial delay was an hour and then 4 hours and so on and so forth until there was a 46 hour delay... This was also due to flight attendants not flying as they had already maxed their allotted “air hours” TUI have accepted full fault for this and have encouraged people to seek compensation...

Unless the UK wants to start off a new economic life by showing the world how good we are at breaking peace treaty, I do not see how a 'no-deal' is even discussed, nor why politicians who propose a 'no-deal'are not just challenged about keeping the GFA?

You are receiving this because you have requested email updates from the UK government. The Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union today set out information for EU citizens and their family members in the UK **in the event of a no deal exit from the EU**. The UK Government: Confirms that **if there is no deal**, the EU Settlement Scheme will continue to be implemented, enabling EU citizens and their family members living in the UK by 29 March 2019 to secure their status and continue to be able to work, study, and access benefits and services in the UK on the same basis after we exit the EU as they do now. The scheme will be fully open by 30 March 2019 as planned. Confirms that the Home Office will continue to look to grant status rather than refuse and in line with the UK commitment to be more generous in certain respects than the draft Withdrawal Agreement, a person will not be refused status under the EU Settlement Scheme because, for example, they are not economically active or they do not hold comprehensive sickness insurance. There would be some changes to the EU Settlement Scheme **if the UK leaves the EU without a deal**, and further details are set out in the policy document. In particular, **as there will be no agreed implementation period**, the application deadline will be brought forward to 31 December 2020. You do not need to do anything for now. The EU Settlement Scheme will be fully open by 30 March 2019. Further information about the scheme can be found on GOV.UK.”",a3pq37,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) experiences in England?,unitedkingdom,"I'll save you the big story about all of my physical, mental and sexual symptoms but I'm seriously concerned that the long list of issues that have plagued my for all of my adult life are hormonal in nature. I've decided that I'm first going to approach my GP and request detailed blood tests but I've read some crappy things about how British doctors treat testosterone levels and wanted some advice since it may be better to just go straight to a private clinic. First thing is how their reference ranges for 'normal' T levels start around 280-300 (going up to 900) based on old studies which group together men of all ages, conditions, health status etc so a 20 year old male with a level of 300 ng/dl is considered 'normal' but compared to who? A 70 year old man? The few studies that have been adjusted for age show that the average level for a young man is around 617 ng/dl. That's a massive difference from the NHS range which says anything from 300-900 is 'normal'! Second is how GPs only test total T levels which isn't the whole picture, that have to test free, unbound T, SHBG, E levels etc and third is stories of people not being taken seriously, told they can't have low T because they look in shape or have facial hair, only to later discover they do in fact have low levels and to feel like a different person after treatment. So, for anybody who has done this, any advice on how I should approach my GP and am I best simply just going to a private/specific TRT clinic for testing/consultations? I'm genuinely worried that my GP will just laugh me out of the office.",aal5dm,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Dixons Car Phone Warehouse data breach,unitedkingdom,I have received two emails trying to blackmail me quoting passwords I only used on my online accounts for Dixons Car Phone Warehouse. The passwords were only used with these sites. They claim to have hacked my email etc and demand bitcoin or they will contact my contact list with compromising details etc... I read that dixons got hacked. I was looking into doing a SAR but their website says I must scan my passport and submit via a web form. Is this right? It seems a silly way of showing I was the person who opened the account and dangerous. I did not show a passport before to them. Has anyone else got these emails?

Help choosing a uni,unitedkingdom,"Apologize in advance if there’s a better place to have written this post, but I just need a bit of help to decide which uni I’ll be attending next year. I got into KCL, Manchester and Edinburgh (denied from Oxford, heh), and I am currently leaning towards Manchester. I’ve gotten into Manchester for Biological Sciences, and Edinburgh and KCL for Biochemistry. Now the problem is, is that I don’t really like chemistry much, and I would rather do pure biology instead. Another enticing aspect of Manchester is the fact that it would only be three years, instead of the four that Edinburgh would be.

The Uncomfortable connection between Ethnicity and Crime,unitedkingdom,"Hi There, I often see a lot of comments on posts on /r/unitedkingdom attempting to skirt around the VERY uncomfortable discussion around Crime and Race. I wanted to get a better understanding and explaination as to why Black/Mixed ethnicity citizens of the UK carry out a disproportionate amount of crime per 1,000 than other races. From statistics provided for 2016/2017 from Gov.uk  we get the following data for arrests per 1,000 people. * 1st - Black - 38 * 2nd - Mixed - 26 * 3rd - Asian - 14 * 4th - White - 12 * 5th - Other Inc. Chinese - 10 Now from this its clear that its not just an immigation issue, as both Asian and Other Inc. Chinese have MUCH lower rates of arrest than Black and Mixed ethnicity citizens and have both very comparable rates of immigation to other ethnicities. You COULD make the argument that its a geographical thing, that cities tend to attract a wider range of ethnicities and there is generally more crime in cities but when looking at Arrest rates by Geographic area its clear there is something else at play with Dorest and Cumbria leading with an eye watering 128 and 104 arrests of Black Ethnicity citizens per 1,000. With both counties having no particularly strong metropolitan areas. I'd also like to point out that Cumbria also has the highest rate of arrests per 1,000 for the Other Inc. Chinese ethnicity, however on the whole Other Inc. Chinese also has incredibly low rates of crime in neighbouring counties such as Lancashire (3 in 1,000) which is not the case for others. I suspect this is largely to do with the tourism draw of the lakes for predominantly Chinese tourists during the summer but I don't have anything to back this up apart from anecdotal evidence from the numerous visits over the years. So my question is, what is driving this? I 100% do not believe the answer is something as simple as 'The Police Force is Racist' because if that were the case, we'd see a larger jump between White and all other non-white ethnicities which is not the case. Is it a Cultural thing? Lack of Opportunities? Under-reporting of Crime in traditional white neighbour hoods? Is this something that actually has an explaination?",aah9wj,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Why are no calls for the Queen to intervene in Brexit?,unitedkingdom,"As an Irish outsider, who is following very closely, what I can not understand is why are there no calls for the Queen to intervene in the Brexit crisis? It is the most mad, insane, and existential crisis to have faced the United Kingdom in her reign. It's no exaggeration to say that leave, or remain, that the crisis may tear the country apart. She enjoys a lot of earned trust and respect in the nation, amongst both retainers and beleavers and is likely the only institution to enjoy that. It seems like a careful considered speech from her could go a long way to making a dent in the non-reality bubbles, and possibly even constraining the worst of the Tory press, who are generally very respectful of the monarchy and would be hard-pressed to go against clear statements from her. What is the point of having a relatively neutral head of state who can rise above politics if it is not to safeguard the nation in times like these? But I haven't seen even whispers of the idea.

So it seems the “BBC bias” thing is still constantly attracting a lot of attention from everyone, but I’m incredibly confused about it all...People on the right accuse it of having a “left wing”/“liberal” bias. Labour supporters accuse it of having an “anti-Corbyn” bias. Leavers accuse it of having a “remainer” bias. Left-wingers accuse it of having a “Tory” bias. It seems everybody of all political persuasions accuse the BBC of having a bias that is against their own personal beliefs. Is nobody picking up on how stupid this logic is? Surely it’s therefore NOT “bias” as a whole? I’m picking up on this now because tonight’s “Have I Got News For You” episode was hosted by Gary Lineker - a man who is notable for being very outspoken online when it comes to politics. However I was looking on Twitter, and loads of right-wingers were angry about him hosting and saying things like, because he’s critical of the Conservatives and Brexit, then this is “classic BBC bias”. But equally, lots of left wingers were saying that, because he criticised Jeremy Corbyn this week, then it’s “classic BBC bias” and were saying the exact same things but coming from totally opposite viewpoints.

It's all the EU is willing to give regardless of who asks surely? Which would have ended up being a no deal brexit since they didn't want to approve the deal she got. So yeah the question goes for us too I guess. May and us got a shit deal but if the EU will just absolutely not budge then what else could anyone have done to get a better deal in her position? I dont like her and obviously Id prefer just another brexit election and for it to be cancelled but this is just reffering to her doing a crap job with brexit and the deals and stuff.

No-Deal Brexit - Calm me down,unitedkingdom,"Watching the Commons Statement yesterday, this wave of dread came over me as I realised that the chances of No Deal are rising with every day that passes. The PM wants her deal, which has no majority. Labour refuse to do their job and advocate for a 2nd ref even when more than half the country now want one. No Deal is now being prepared for in full force by the government. Our political system is broken, our politicians have gone rogue, serving the wishes of a few people over the needs of the country. Failing to see the path to a positive outcome now. PS: My parents run a fresh food shop, relying on UK-based suppliers and supply chains that will likely be hammered by supermarkets turning to UK farms when No-Deal restricts their access to EU food markets.",a7bazt,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Proportional representation - proportional to remaining life expectancy.,unitedkingdom,"So Brexit is generally regarded as being supported by the elderly and opposed by the young. Would it be better if voting influence was proportional to remaining expected life expectancy, with a modifier for life experience. Voting points would be awarded per age band. **0-18** : zero, as insufficient experience **18-25** : a few, as they think they know it, but actually don’t. **26-40** : maximum, they know how many beans make five, and still have enough years remaining to care **41-65** : slightly less than before. Experience up, but ‘feeling the pain of bad decisions’ is reducing. **66-75** : a few. A bit more experience is outweighed by remaining life expectancy **76+** : zero. They’ve had their day, time to make way for the next generation. Would something like this be fair, or a bit fascist? I can’t work it out.",a686ba,self.unitedkingdom,,True
Idea,unitedkingdom,"Ok, so the following idea is based on the rationale that the more connected people are (be that strangers, acquaintances, colleagues) the better the world is. This is because people are happier, and get along with one another. **The idea** You wear a fluorescent yellow band on your little finger. This serves as a signal /green light to other people that you are 'open' to connecting with strangers. Consequently, a stranger can come up to you and ask for a card. This card you give them details information about you that you are open to sharing, such as: \- Your hobbies \- Your allegiances (sports, politics wise) \- Goals/targets you currently are working towards So, essentially, you would carry around copies of these cards with you, and a few times every day a stranger may engage you in conversation as a result.

Need legal advice on how to proceed with possibly illegal practices of a company operating in the UK,unitedkingdom,"Hello, me and a relative are both working for the same company, in London. For 3 months now my relative has been put on emergency tax and overcharged with money. They have repeatedly said during communications with us that this money will be repaid to us during the next payment date. Now my relative has sent the Payroll team all the information they supposedly needed to take her off the emergency tax, and she received a confirmation e-mail (proof) saying that it's been done, it's in the system and it won't happen again. Cue today, another payment date, another emergency tax overcharge, and none of the emergency tax money has been given back. Here's the kicker - I'm ILLEGIBLE to pay taxes as of yet. This is my 2nd payday with this company, and during my first one I HAD NOT been put on emergency tax. This past month however, I racked up more hours with them and to no surprise guess who's on emergency tax aswell. Anyway, I'd like to ask someone who might know a bit more than me in this sphere, if there's anything I can do to fix this, except contact their inept payroll, as they've proved that they're either doing some shady shit or a monkey would do a better job in their place. I'd really like to raise this to a higher instance and see if there's anything illegal, but most importantly I'd just really appreciate help as to know who I can contact to resolve these matters. P.S: This emergency tax shit has happened to every single employee and colleague contracted to this company on site, and it's fucking insane, it's the first time i've ever seen such a ridiculous thing happen in a 1st world country.

'I'm a Celeb'; what does it all mean?,unitedkingdom,"Making people do humiliating stuff on live tv is nothing new and not unique to the UK but there's something particularly visceral about 'I'm a celeb' (the gore, the insects, the smell they always talk about). There's also the relentless nature of it; they can't go home, everything they do is on camera, they are stripped of the luxury and glamour we associate with celebs. The only way they can leave is by uttering a humiliating phrase, designed to parody the cliche diva activity we associate with b list celebs. I've always thought there's a strong element of TV Go Home to the show, like it's a double joke; we humiliate the celebs who are willing to do anything for money by punishing them for their elevated status, but it's also a double joke on the public who will lap up whatever grotesqueness they're told to by their media lords and masters. There's a strong layer of genuine, bitter, sarcasm to everything Ant and Dec do as adults and part of me wonders if that's a reason behind one of them's addiction issues (sorry, still don't know which is which). Either way I still find it compulsive viewing (less so this year due to the lack of conflict) largely due to how bewilderingly strange it is.

My experience of public transport,unitedkingdom,"“Dirty air is damaging our health” posters are being displayed all over Greater Manchester at the moment, all in the name of getting people out of their cars and into public transport. This isn’t the first time that excessive CO2 emissions are in the public eye, you only have to turn on the news to hear about we’re killing the polar bears/seals/orangutans (delete as appropriate). In this media fuelled effort, I have decided to use the campaigns tagline of “clear the air” and investigate personally the differences in my daily commute between driving and public transport. For one whole month, I am hanging up my keys and ditching the car for the train, metro and bus, all so you don’t have to. &#x200B; As a baseline comparison; accounting for car insurance, petrol and the cost of the PCP on my car I estimate that I spend approximately £200 a month on travelling to and from work, and a total of 22 hours. &#x200B; Now we have our control, let’s start the experiment. I reluctantly change my alarm clock from 7am to 5am. This is going to be a tough month, but it’s all in the name of science. &#x200B; 5:00am. The cheery chimes of my alarm hit me like a brick wall. Groggy-eyed, I stumble out of bed, over the dog and down the stairs. 5:05am. Coffee made, I debate how much work I can get done before I need to shower. If I were driving, I usually have a good 30 minutes to fire off some emails before getting ready. After much deliberation I decide against it; work can be done on the train. 5:40am. Showered, shaved, breakfasted and clothed, I gaze out of the window in misery as the rain pours down. Time to take the dog for a walk. 6:10am. I’m now as wet as I was back in the shower. The dog shakes himself off all over the kitchen much to the displeasure of the cat who decides to run off, but not before evacuating his bladder on the stairs carpet. 6:20am. Crisis dealt with, I begin the journey to the railway station. It’s a matter of minutes by Uber, however I’m supposed to be saving the trees, so brandishing an umbrella and walking boots, I make the 40-minute walk to the station. 7:05am. Ticket in hand, I stand on the platform as the icy winds tunnel through the station. Everyone waiting for the train has the same expression of misery and tiredness: is this what awaits me at the end of the month? 7:30am. The train pulls into Manchester Piccadilly. Despite Piccadilly being ranked one of the worst railway stations for delays and cancellations, I arrive on time. We penguin-march off the train and through to the exit. 7:31am. My tram leaves from Victoria. Damn. I trudge back through the rain, avoiding charity muggers and homelessness as best as possible. 8:02am. I lug myself and the increasingly heavy bag onto the tram. There’s no seating available so I spend the entire journey holding on for dear life, trying not to fall into the lap of the person next to me. 8:32am. The cool air is a fresh relief as the tram doors open and nauseously, I clamber out of the unfathomably hot tube of despair. 8:39am. The final stretch. Just the bus to go. 8:53am. I arrive at work just in time. I clock in and sit down at my desk. &#x200B; The day finishes at 5:00pm and the journey home is just as repulsive as it was in the morning. I arrive home just in time for Coronation Street. &#x200B; So here I am one month later, with eyebags like suitcases and phenomenal brain fog, sitting at a table with a pile of receipts. In total, over the course of the month I have spent £366.30 in travel and a total of 107 hours commuting. I’m also behind on my paperwork, malnourished, and my pocket feels distinctly lighter from the financial battering over the past 30 days. &#x200B; Was it all worth it? Do I feel better about my life? Have I developed a sudden feeling of superiority over my car driving colleagues? In short, no. I grasp my keys as if I were Gollum clutching the One Ring and curl up in bed. &#x200B; The environmental risk of driving is real but replacing cars with public transportation is both unsustainable and unrealistic. I have had the single worst month of my life, one I never hope to repeat. Until local authorities can get their act together and make communal travel both cost effective and convenient, I will continue to battle the traffic jams and toll roads. &#x200B; Here is my advice to you all: Write to your MP. Express your concerns regarding the failure of public transport to deliver. One voice can be silenced, but the will of the people (Brexit joke, no shame) cannot. If you choose to take the train, then wear a big coat and carry water. And above all, NEVER do what I did unless you have any other option. &#x200B; &#x200B; Edit: Wow. I seem to have sparked quite a passionate set of comments. Just to answer a few questions: \- My house is nowhere near a bus route, the walk is the quickest way \- Going into Manchester and then out again is also the quickest \- I did start using the tram (direct) from Piccadilly to Victoria, but it increased my monthly costs and didn't cut off any time from my journey so stopped.",a3xzmr,self.unitedkingdom,,True

To avoid getting sick myself, could I just... refuse to come in until they are better/taking time off to recover?

Brexit: The Media Backlash.,unitedkingdom,"Much has been said about 'blood on the streets' should Brexit be overturned. But should Brexit (especially a no-Deal version), go ahead and prove to be the disaster the experts predict, then those tabloids who've been printing lies and disinformation about Brexit and the EU will have nowhere to hide. Their stance is a matter of record, and they will be called to account by their readers. Even the most partisan reader could work out the mismatch between what was printed, and the hard reality. The precedent exists. The S*n newspaper has been boycotted by the City of Liverpool for over twenty years, after the lies it printed about 'thieving Scousers' at Hillsborough. Once readers realise how they've been lied to, and on such a grand scale, a backlash against the tabloids could be inevitable and spell their end. Ironically enough, maybe their salvation lies in printing the truth about Brexit as best as it's known; tacitly admitting they made a mistake. The time for tabloid media opinion-as-fact, for the anti-EU agendas of billionaire owners and interests, has to end. For once, and for just a brief period, the media must serve the UK with honest, pragmatic journalism worthy of the name the 'fourth pillar of democracy', rather than serve financial or egotistical priorities. Should the UK crash out of the EU come March 29th, and then all hell breaks loose, those tabloid newspapers had better pray, because the 'blood on the streets' might end up coming from unexpected sources.

Help put a end to lies from the government,unitedkingdom,"Hi everyone, last week i made a post asking about the lies told to us by our politicians. I am a 20 year old student interested in learning more about politics and what I find and always have found astonishing is the fact that the people expect the people running our country to lie to us, to the point that this is a regular joke. I intend to create a short video highlighting this and hopefully raise awareness and begin change in the political system where lies are not rewarded. I understand that a video on its own will not achieve this but its better than doing nothing. Like all of you I am a busy person, and my personal knowledge of politics is not as deep as i would like it to be and i do not want to make any false assumptions on a topic I know little about. So I ask for all of your help, to share lies told by the government and also including sources, preferably including video evidence of this that i can include in the video. I do not care what party or politicians lies you share, only that you share them as lies are unhealthy to our political system and damage the public's interest.

All opinions are welcome here and I encourage debate in the comments. &#x200B; We need to provisionally consider a few factors. A no deal Brexit is damaging not only economically but also constitutionally to the people of Northern Ireland. Any form of border between ROI and NI could cause a rise in terrorism and loss of life. This is irrefutably not acceptable, let alone all the other considerations including economic hit and more. &#x200B; Therefore, with the current deal appearing to be DOA, it feels as though we have only the option to remain. How do we sell this to the public in a fair, democratic form. &#x200B; My proposal is such, Revoke article 50 as per our right to, and consult the public on the fact that we are entering a further review and negotiation period. We must properly form a complete plan on the full impacts of Brexit and will provide the period of time, possibly years, to fully factor for and produce a detailed plan on leaving the European Union. This plan will be designed by a committee that shall be composed of pro leave politicians so no political sabotage may take place. &#x200B; This deal will only be proposed to parliament to ratify the facts and to make sure that all proposals are achievable under the plan. This deal once accepted will be proposed to the public under a new referendum. It will be along the lines of 'Do we leave under this final deal or remain'. &#x200B; This is what should have been done 2 years ago.

The issue here is if you live in South or East Bristol, you essentially have one or 2 roads that lead into the centre, leading to bottlenecks and congestion for hours, despite the length of road really covering at max about 4km. No underground, despite cities such as Newcastle having one. The public transport system is to be honest, about 30 years behind the basics even in smaller cities in Germany and about 50 years behind the underground in London...

Whats happened to the UK advertising standards!!!,unitedkingdom,"I emigrated to Australia 7 years ago, I recently went back home for a few weeks for a visit. My parents are in thier mid to late sixties and are semi retired (should be completely retired but apparently that's not really possible for working class people now days) anyway the daytime TV was absolutely appalling in my opinion with repeats of old tv soaps, game shows and for some reason heartbeat was on all the time. The advertisments these shows had between breaks was the real problem for me. If it wasn't an add for funeral or life insurance it was a begging advert from a charity. I'm not a mean spirited person and I know charity is an important thing but this was relentless I could almost predict the line up of adds, life insurance - charity - funeral insurance and to top it of a short term loan add with a 10000000%+ interest rate incase you need the cash quick. I was home for 3 weeks and it seemed relentless and depressing. It's clearly aimed at the older generation and the working class who are struggling the worst as it is. The TV channels need to take a good look at what they are advertisings. Plus when was 'every little helps' and a bucket for your spare change not good enough for charities anymore, they all want regular monthly payments of only £15 but it will save a life or give clean water to the masses!. I'm all for giving to charity but at a time when people are at their financial lowest in decades, food banks on the corners for people to just survive then these pressure and guilt ridden adds need to be regulated harder.",a5xbty,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Brexit: The Lie That Broke the Nation,unitedkingdom,"Of all the lies that surrounded the 2016 referendum, one specifically stands out as the most insidious, cunning and manipulative that, to this day, it has rooted itself nearly incontestably into the national psyche. It wasn't the doomsaying of the Remainers. It wasn't blazed on the side of of a bus. But it was uttered, repeatedly, like a sick mantra by the architects of Brexit, punctuating their every phrase, emphasising their every argument, and drip-dripped into the national subconsciousness like a trigger in a Manchurian Candidacy. **Take Back Control.** A phrase designed to exploit a weakness of the human condition whilst offering an illusory solution. The insinuation, of course, is that somehow, 'we' lost control. That 'we' had become powerless, drifting, voiceless. The truth is, 'we' have never had control, and the big Lie was that somehow, voting for Brexit would alter this fact. We live under a system where our protests, our votes and our referendums mean nothing, where our politicians put the cart of party politics before the horse of national interest. The UK deserved an honest discussion and debate about the risks, benefits, and implications of Brexit, i.e. the same level of Informed Consent to expect if one was undergoing major medical treatment, making a major financial investment, or making any potentially life-changing decision. Instead, we got a shambles that has turned us into an international laughing stock at worst, a figure of pity at best. *Some forty years ago, the Labour government negotiated terms of the UK's entry into the EC (after decades of trying as the 'sick man of Europe'), discussed and debated the issues in Parliament, THEN had a Parliamentary vote, and only THEN held a referendum.* **Take Back Control.** The UK isn't part of Schengen. The UK isn't part of the Euro. The UK is entirely responsible for its fiscal policy. The Bank of England operates as an independent entity. **Take Back Control.** The people never had any, and the Government had never lost it; at least not until after the referendum result. **Take Back Control.** It isn't the EU we need to take control back from. It's from the apparent incompetence and vagaries of a hundreds of years old UK political system barely fit for its modern day purpose.",a2cva7,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Officials say that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal and on unfriendly terms, they must “create a strategy with other government departments — handling the negative impacts (eg homelessness, poverty and suicide).” This outcome is likely to cause unemployment and welfare spending to rise to levels last seen after the 2008-09 crash. The unemployment benefit bill could rise by almost £12 billion over three years.

The People's Vote: why a supermajority is essential,unitedkingdom,"The most popular counter-argument against holding the People's vote is the 'best of three?'. It is compelling, and hard to argue against, but only if the result would be as close-run as the last. The only way to hold the People's referendum whilst 'honouring' (and I use that word very loosely, because the whole thing, from conception to execution was a disgrace) the result of the last one is to consider the Leave result as the new status quo which would require a supermajority vote to alter. This approach respects the result and the 'will of the people', whilst opening the door for a fresh look given new information. The fact that a supermajority should have been required with the previous referendum is simply more evidence as to how it was a botched affair; but the clock can't be turned back and the situation has to be dealt with as it stands. The hard-core, cliff-edge Brexiteers have to be beaten fair and square or better yet, defeated even with a head-start. We know what's on offer: May's Deal, No Deal, or Remain. If the UK does not choose decisively to Remain given what is now known about the other two options, then neither the EU, nor the Government nor Parliament can be held at fault. If only Remainers had the courage to support the supermajority; there'd be no argument that could stand against a People's vote. The only question would be what that number should be.

An update from a student on the Sheffield school which had a riot in September,unitedkingdom,"Alt account as I don't want to be revealed. Almost three months ago, there was a full blown riot at a school in Sheffield. You can see a post surrounding the incident here:  I commented pretty late into that post's life as someone who was in attendance in the school while it happened. It was certainly a very strange time for the school and the community. I figured I would give an update for anyone who happened to see that post and might wonder what ever happened to it (even though most people probably just forgot) 1) The head teacher at the time was and still is notorious among students and teachers alike for how he handled the situation. I witnessed him run away from the situation, not try to deal with it himself and he did not take enough action towards those involved early on. He remained for a short amount of time before randomly disappearing on a Friday on 'meetings'. Later, we received a letter saying that our head teacher and the governors came to a mutual agreement that he would leave. 2) A new head teacher has, therefore, been appointed. She has been fantastic and is much more strict than the old head teacher ever was. This is definitely what I believe the school needs and I am glad with what she is doing, for example being much more willing to kick out students involved in serious incidents like this. She is also willing to acknowledge what happened, rather than pretend it never did. 3) The school has hired full time security 4) The atmosphere is much different. 5) There have, of course, been fights since the riot. They have been dealt with extremely well. Before 2018, I would have recommended this school to any future students. After a car crashed into the front gate in early 2018 I questioned whether I could. With the riot, I definitely would never have recommended the school to anyone. I still don't think I could. However, thankfully for me and other people in the area, I can see things changing for the better. I hope that later this school can become great again, the teachers deserve it and so do those students who put in the effort. I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has, good or bad.",a74fhp,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Send the word ‘register’ in an SMS message to 999 2. You will then receive SMS messages about the service 3. When you have read these SMS messages reply by sending ‘yes’ in an SMS message to 999 4. You will receive a SMS message telling you that your mobile phone is registered or if there is a problem with your registration. Just to really push this point home – your phone number MUST be registered before you can use this service. Be aware that the text service may take longer than a normal 999 call and it should only be used as a last resort – for example, if calling 999 and talking out loud would put you in further danger. Once registered, hopefully you will never find yourself in a situation in which you require emergency services – but just in case below are a few simple steps to alerting them to your problem and location silently. The SMS to 999 must include which emergency service you need, a brief description of the emergency and your location. ",a4kllg,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Has anybody recorded their PIP assessment?,unitedkingdom,"Evening /r/UK, I know it's late but I'm curious. My missus has a PIP assessment tomorrow as she's recently being diagnosed with fibromyalgia after 18 months of tests, appointments and waiting lists. I encouraged her to apply for it as if she's entitled to it, why not etc. I'm also on PIP for various mental/neurological problems however I've never been treated to the ~~horror~~ pleasure of an assessment, bizarrely enough - they just took my diagnosis letters as proof enough and awarded it to me for a length of time, so I don't really know how this process works. I have, however read the absolute shower of shite they try and get away with, and frankly I'm not about to let them fuck my missus over considering some days she can't even get up off the couch without being helped, or walk from the living room to the kitchen without being in excruciating agony. She's already had to resign from a job because she physically couldn't get to work. I know it's a no-no to record them unless you've got a DWP approved recorder (!), but I've found an app that can run discretely on my Apple Watch - if it came to appeal and tribunal, would this be able to be entered as evidence? I've got memory problems (ADHD, so my working memory is non-existent) and fibromyalgia gives you brain fog when it flares up - which it undoubtedly will as stress is a trigger, as well as the cold so remembering between us is probably not really going to be a realistic possibility. How horrible an idea is recording the assessment on a scale of 1-10? Will they end the assessment and bar her from applying if they catch me recording it? ",a752jr,self.unitedkingdom,,True

What saddens me about this whole Brexit nonsense,unitedkingdom,"I thought I'd share  that found it's way on to my Facebook feed yesterday. Like everyone, I loathe Facebook and only go on it for largely business reasons. The post above was shared by my Uncle (by marriage). He's a man around 60. He's working class, not the sharpest tool in the box but not a meathead either. He's a nice guy. He took me to watch Derby County play when I was small. He always wishes me happy birthday. He's done well for himself in that he has a large, friendly family and a nice house. He's just an average guy who has worked for his whole life and tried to do right. Considering the above paragraph, it pains me that he'd hold views like this. There's so much wrong with this post. Let's step aside the fact that actually, there was a deal in place (It was called the 1939 Anglo-Polish alliance. It meant France, UK and Poland all would protect each other if Germany attacked). Also, by this point, I hope that we're all in agreement that WW2 references are essentially the Goodwin's law of Brexit as well. What really winds me up is that someone who grew up knowing the horrors of WW2 and was educated in the tragic tally of life lost, would act so flippant. The UK didn't 'Free them'. The UK did what every other free country did - fight for survival, eradicate the danger. Europe didn't 'owe' us. They didn't beg. We did what had to be done. Out of necessity. Posts like this showcase a vitriolic anger that only leads to Fascism down the road. Re-writing the past to justify their backward views of false-glory from a long dead time. Sorry folks, I just needed to share this and get it off my chest. I never thought we'd see the day where our country would be being torn apart by Xenophobia, largely by an aging and bigoted generation.",a7ajjn,self.unitedkingdom,,True

This means our bill to pay is double what it 'should' be, and being students we're stretching to afford the original bill (£120 each) let alone the more than double adjusted bill.

ESA (Support Group) cancelled.,unitedkingdom,"Hello, Here's just a brief overview, even though there's so much information: My partner has been on ESA within the support group for many years due to having severe mental health (Schizo-effective Disorder, ADHD, GAD) and also receives PIP. &#x200B; We've recently moved into our first house and have been told that he cannot claim any other benefit apart from PIP since it's not means tested and I work 35 hours a week. What's getting to me is this was a positive step as it was causing a lot of distress with him living with his parents and he is incredibly embarrassed about his condition and the fact he has to claim benefits just to essentially live, yet now he's being penalised for trying to better himself. &#x200B; This isn't a sob story but he tries so hard to improve his life. He is currently house-bound due to losing his Psychologist, and his Psychiatrist is awful, mixing up his files with other people and then relaying incorrect information basically showing he doesn't even care about my partners health (last year he prescribed my partner medication which specifically should not be given to those with mood disorders, causing him to have a severe manic episode and causing a lot of issues as you can imagine). &#x200B; There are always others out there who have it worse, I appreciate this but every circumstance is individual. This is about principle and how backwards the benefits system is. Again, putting those who want to get better on the back burner and essentially encouraging people to not improve their lives. &#x200B; My question is why are those who have no intention of going back to work allowed to keep their benefit yet those who actually want to do something with their life get penalised? &#x200B; Also any information is greatly appreciated, we're contacting our local MP as the entire situation is just disgusting.",a64wqj,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Should a vote of no confidence be called on the Labour leader?,unitedkingdom,"First I would like to say that Jeremy Corbyn’s a leader that shows so many positive traits that I can get behind but replacing him as Labour leader is from what I can see the only way out of this shambolic a Brexit negotiation. I do unfortunately feel as though he, at the helm of the opposition, is putting his party and himself ahead of the needs of the country. Corbyn has been trying to get out of Europe for the best part of his political career (mental that the party supposed to be looking to leave is headed by a remain voter and vice versa). The SNP have already said they will back Labours no confidence vote if they agree to a second referendum which is what a lot of people feel we need, as will the Lib Dem’s who are openly a remain party. With all the infighting in the Conservatives and although the DUP support leaving, they will not support Theresa Mays deal whilst the backstop is in place (which the EU refuse to remove) I feel that if there is a chance for a second referendum, it will be passed as long as there is a party with enough power to table it. I do not feel as though Corbyn will call a vote of no confidence on the government as it may unite the Tories behind May and the infighting is ruining their PR. This should not be the biggest worry for us. JC stands for almost everything that I believe the government should be doing, renationalising our services, reducing the cost of education and imposing higher and stricter taxes on the richest to help the poorest. This is unfortunately not enough to allow for him to continue to allow the opposition to destroy their support, and the country along with it. ",a7ea9g,self.unitedkingdom,,True

BBC and others are trying to make it look like a drone is responsible for the Severn Bridge closure,unitedkingdom,"Obviously trying to play on the 'Drone Panic' that has come about after the issues at Gatwick before Christmas, the BBC is running a headline on its front page: 'Drone flight behind Severn Bridge closure' Only once you read the article do you see that the issue was actually that the police were called because someone climbed one of the bridge towers and the bridge was closed temporarily because of the risk to his own life and the people below, the drone has nothing to do with it. They end the article with a comment about the Gatwick closure, as if the two events are in any way similar. Two weeks ago, the article would have been about a guy climbing the tower. In fact, two weeks ago the article probably wouldn't have even existed at all, let alone on the front page. But now they can use it to drum up some fresh controversy. They are not the only ones, Sky News and the Times are both reporting that a drone caused the closure. I know that drones are a hot topic right now, but I expected better.

Are business **only** backing May because they dont want any other incompetent tory shitbag potentially making things worse for *them?* Yet again we will be in the same BS situation expecting one of the most incompetent british governments ever seen to do an impossible job in which whatever evil you pick, you piss off a chunk of voters. From cameron calling this referendum to 'unite' his party to where we are at the present day, this entire flaming bonfire of shit is **100% down to the tories.** They gave the option, they've allowed so many sly and unfit people get involved politically who have their own motivations with brexit which would vastly disaffect many average working people. They broke referendum rules and yet *it still doesnt matter?* Still today at PMQ's May rolls out the line 'Anything is better than a Corbyn lead government' - Is someone slipping TM LSD!? She must be really off her rocker to think that any other government could fuck up *THIS* much. Its an impossible job because we asked such a simple question: 'Do you want to remain part of the EU?' The *only* logical thing to do, that is somewhat fair is to firstly, hold another referendum. Secondly, depending on the result, sort the fucking government out. If the second referendum comes back as remain, trigger a GE. If its leave, May has to go. Instead what we will be left with at 9pm tonight is the same incorrigible wankers trying to frantically dig themselves out of a hole or their own making while taking toilet breaks on the people of this country and our so called democracy. I hope this finally triggers some sort of organised mass protests. Its absolute madness that any government can act in such a way as these bastards have. **Edit 1:** For anyone interested, here is PMQ's:  questions begin around 4:50 mins in, TM dodges questions and comes out with the same BS rhetoric - Its not good enough. Its not professional. Its not clever. **Edit 2:** I think a general strike would be the best way to snap the governments attention away from itself and onto the people it should be serving. With TM having the support of business, a general strike would see her lose that support quickly. Any replacement that comes along could be ousted in the same method until a second referendum or GE is called. Protests in this country are easily ignored and calmed with lies and half-truths by whatever political figurehead is leading at the time. Strikes are always the best way to hurt governments who are hurting the people they should be serving. ",a5j99r,self.unitedkingdom,,True

Anyone ever registered as a sole-trader software developer contractor? The process could be described in pictorial form as an Escher painting,unitedkingdom,"So it just took me almost two hours to register myself as a sole-trader and register for the ability to charge VAT. And I still won't receive my unique tax code or unique VAT code for probably another month. How is this happening? I've worked on several government IT projects (MOT, MOT reminders, DEFRA, DFT etc.) and if one of my fellow developers on those projects shat out the fetid mess that is the sole-trader application journey they'd get politely told to redo it in a way that actual humans understand. And the thing is, I'm meant to start providing software development and architecture far before I will receive my VAT code, so I'm losing 3.5% on every single transaction I make as a contractor. Unbelievable. Edit to describe where 3.5% comes from: So everyone charges VAT at the same rate (20% (yes I know there are exceptions)), but different industries have to pay VAT back to the gov at different rates. So for software it's 16.5%. So I would be charging the customer a 20% surcharge, and basically directly pocketing 3.5% of the total, which isn't insignificant. >/rant>",a27jc4,self.unitedkingdom,,True

My neighbor has thus been told to close the door on the TV licence people, but they often don't announce themselves straight away - having strangers call is bad enough for anxiety, but strangers who know your name coming to your door is a little distressing. My neighbor is okay with other bills as everything gets paid via BACS. They've no support re. social worker.

"The BBC are now running attack articles on left-wing cult heroes, calling them evil.",unitedkingdom,"For those who still doubt that our British Broadcasting Company have been bought by the government, it is important that you read this article. They use the highly emotive term evil to dismiss important figures in the left wing movement and rights movements, cultural icons who helped to move the forward. These bastions of liberty, freedom and progress dismissed as evil. &#x200B;  &#x200B; Father Christmas - St Nick is reduced to a defender of slave labour and apparently he's cruel to his reindeer. What a load of bollocks. &#x200B; John Lennon is reduced to a wifebeater - yes he occasionally hit people but that does not automatically make one evil. All of us our capable of turning round and lamping someone in the right circumstances. &#x200B; Roald Dahl - rather than exploring the Willy Wonka as a sense of wonder of Charlie and Willy Wonka as the villain, the BBC in explicably decided that Roald Dahl shares Willy Wonka's views on maiming children? What? A quote about jews is just pulled out of context and given no fair chance of appraisal, nobody picks on anyone for no reason - their reasons might be batshit crazy but they still have reasons - stating that does not make one anti-semitic. &#x200B; Gandhi - not content with the above, the BBC really fucking go for it here; Ghandi - the inventor of non-violent resistance is dismissed as a racist and it's implied he was a nonce. Another attempt by the BBC do discredit our heroes to make those of us who stand for change to look like we look up to evil people. &#x200B; Mother Theresa - this really is entering into full troll mode now. No evaluation of the context in which Mother Theresa denied that said treatment - it was a case of she couldn't give it to everyone and did not want to make the situation worse by causing riots over who got it. Is that not obvious? Better to help many people a little bit, than help few people an awful lot. &#x200B; Albert Einstein - not content with having a go at 5 of our great heroes, the BBC contends to have a go at the greatest physicist of modern times. Apparently the fact that he made a discovery, which other people then decided to use for horrendous purposes makes him evil? Sorry not buying it. He did what any great scientist does; made discoveries. The blood in Japan is firmly on the hands of the politicians who ordered the bomb, not the guy who made the science available. Are we going to start blaming the first person who realised you could ignite gunpowder with the click of a lever? &#x200B; This is a direct an unnecessary attempt to discredit the left following the targeting of the BBC's dishonest agenda on climate change through Extinction Rebellion (even though that's led by government but the BBC don't know that obviously). It's further proof the BBC is a mouthpiece for the Tories. You could argue these people are flawed, none of them however would meet most sane people's criteria for evil. &#x200B; No doubt the Tories will lap this shit up, but our license fee should not be paying for this propaganda. &#x200B; Funnily enough cowardly enough all the people they attack are dead and unable to defend themselves. &#x200B;",a8f5k6,self.unitedkingdom,,True

'The editorials in today’s German newspapers are without exception indignant in tone about the political chaos in the UK.',unitedkingdom,"From the . \--- The editorials in today’s German newspapers are without exception indignant in tone about the political chaos in the UK. (The German version of what we now know the Scottish refer to as a clusterburach is a ‘Tohuwabohu’, by the way.) In a page-long commentary, the tabloid Bild says the unofficial motto of British politics right now it is “if that’s reality, I don’t want to have anything to do with it”. It says this applies equally to the Tories as to Labour. “The appointment with Brexit is in 100 days? We don’t care!” the paper writes, summing up the attitude as it sees it. >*Without an agreement the country is threatened with an economic disaster, according to its own central bank? Other people – not the politicians – are to blame.* >*It has become nothing more than a game of running out the clock, rather than finding a clear line and accepting the fact that there is a price to pay for an EU exit. Theresa May upturned the overdue parliamentary vote on the deal earlier in the week, and as a result the conservative Tories forced her a confidence vote which she won by 200 to 117 votes.* >*But it was simply political spectacle, because May’s victory was predictable and will keep her in office for weeks or months without anything actually changing about the brutal reality: there is no parliamentary majority for the variations of Brexit that are on the table.* >*For a long time the view in Europe towards the divorce-eager Brits was one of understanding and melancholy. But amongst diplomats in Brussels there is now a growing sense of anger towards these would-be captains of Westminster who are steering a whole country onto an iceberg of reality.* >*The possibility of changing course is disappearing by the day.* &#x200B;",a5t3nn,self.unitedkingdom,,True

A message of appreciation for the NHS,unitedkingdom,"On Christmas Eve my father-in-law had an enormous heart attack outside of his local social club. In less than two minutes a first responder was on site to aid those providing CPR, in five a second ambulance was on site to aid in getting my father-in-law to Wythenshawe hospital. For two and a half hours they tried to revive him, not breaking for even a second. My wife who went with him was cared for and even though he unfortunately passed away she was touched by the support she was given from the number of staff trying to revive him to the soft lace pouch she was given at the end which had the remainder of his beer money in. As an emergency response service it is a proud badge this country bears for the world to see. Whilst she is heavily grieving, it is a thought of warmth and comfort to know he was in the best possible hands as he passed on. Something which in my role now as the shoulder to cry on is infinitely grateful for. We raise a glass to my father-in-law and all those on the front line of the NHS, I hope they all get a well deserved break at some point over this holiday period.

My youngest, still little, nearly seven, came up and said 'Daddy, I was thinking Xmas must be great for poor kids as they'll get loads of presents just like us!'

After all, he and his brother always receive exactly the same number of gifts, and we let them think of the Santa myth. They have their doubts, but you can see how they think. But of course, poor kids *don't* get the same, do they? It's not Santa doling out gifts. I've even tried to explain that Santa brings presents we grown ups have paid for, but I suspect the kids think Santa is a generous, fair and redistributive force for good and we pay money to him a bit like taxes. And it kind of hurts, because my children are well protected from the way the world is. Nice country (even with crap like Brexit/anti-immigrant sentiment/lazy politicians etc), with a reasonable level of help and care for all, living in a nice family. When I was a kid, by their age, I'd already been broken and knew that life was unfair.

I am sick of the government telling me what I think.,unitedkingdom,">'The British people do not want a second referendum' Source: Am part of the British public. Okay. I am sure there are some people who do not want, that's a fair assessment to make I'm sure. However, to label that as a catch all statement is just ridiculous. It's obvious those shouting this, the hardliner MP's, the right wing shitrags 'news' papers don't believe in democracy and only repeat this because they know there's a chance they'd lose. That idiotic statement yesterday 'There's people like me who would demand a third vote if we lost' shows it was never about democracy (a vote IS democratic, but a third one right after is being a sore loser. I am positive if leave won a second time around, everyone would accept it, the reason people don't the first, is for so many reasons I'll explain below. Now, of course, my sample size is absolutely tiny. I don't even know a huge amount of brexiteers, just a couple of handfuls. However, of those I do know, most have either given up caring either way, changed side with the argument 'we're not getting what we voted for' or have come to realise it's a really bad idea. I do know one person, my stepfather, who does claim that statement, but he only needs to hear things once from a staunch brexiteer to side with them and repeat their arguments even when debunked. The typical 'they need us more than we need them' or 'we give them all our money and get nothing' etc. I'm going to nick a few of my previous quotes and put it here. TWoTP! ----- The will of the people _has_ changed. In 2016 there were 525,048 deaths registered in England and Wales. That's excluding Scotland and wales. - 65-69 38,565 - 70-74 48,991 - 75-79 64,149 - 80-84 84,506 - 85-90 96,103 - 90+ 111,211 That's 405,563 total deaths in _England and Wales_ alone, just for 2016, for people over 65.  >Just over 70% of 18 to 24-year-olds who voted in the referendum backed Remain, four major academic and commercial polls conducted shortly after the ballot agree, with just under 30% backing Leave. >In contrast, only 40% of those aged 65 and over supported Remain, while 60% placed their cross against Leave. >*These younger and older voters may be even more polarised now*. I don't have the figures of those who were too young to vote, but have now been able to in the last 2 years. I would imagine it's a fairly considerable amount. Considering the last two years has had a large amount of older voters die (where it's known that the older generation have a higher turn out) and that they were much more likely to vote leave, and that the younger generation who couldn't vote, but now can, would vote remain, and that it would be far more likely to have a higher younger turn out this time around AND considering it doesn't take into account Scotland and Ireland, and this isn't considering the original brexiteers who have now changed their mind, I'd say it's a safe bet that in fact, a second referendum would show that the will of the people now, has changed considerably. ----- Illegitimate vote: This is a reply I made to someone wondering why a second vote is undemocratic Democracy is, for all intents and purposes, the will of the people. As wiki describes it: >all for a system of government where the citizens exercise power by voting. In a direct democracy, the citizens as a whole form a governing body and vote directly on each issue. In a representative democracy the citizens elect representatives from among themselves. What *is* undemocratic, is holding citizens to ransom by preventing them to have a vote. You then get the follow up arguments such as 'What? we just keep voting until we get what we want!' Yet, no one has ever suggested such a thing. (quick edit, I wrote this before the guy said yesterday he'd demand a third if leave lost) I have no evidence of such, but I do _strongly_ believe if there was another vote, and the country _still_ decided to leave, then that would be final. No one would ask for a third vote. Democracy is the will of the people now. Not the will of the people then. Views and opinions change. It is not undemocratic to change your mind. More importantly, the previous vote is for lack of a better word, almost illegitimate. There were lies left right and centre (and the Brexit argument that 'Remain lied too!' doesn't help their argument. Remain might have lied, if so, then it should be a vote on truth). - There were lies, the bus, exaggerations and miss-truths. - There were lies about the EU and all it's 'rules'. The rules that made pillows flame retardant. You know, good ones. - There was fraud in the Leave.eu campaign. - There was foreign meddling with evidence such as Russia. - There was a snap election that caused chaos (and even that had illegal actions such as the call centre scandal), - There was Cambridge Analytica sticking their grubby fingers in the pie. Lets not forget, article 50 is not even legally binding. Then we have smaller issues to further increase what a sham it all was. - Remain was looking like a massive win. This would have likely affected the vote turnout with less remainers bothering. - There has been numerous polls showing that the older and/or less educated voted to leave. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, but I don't think a 90 year old voting for an 18 year olds future is quite fair. - Some remainers voted to leave _just_ to stick it to the establishment. This might sound like a stretch but it's true, the following day both main news channels interviewed numerous people who did. - Obama telling us we will be at the back of the queue annoyed a lot of people and didn't appreciate the US telling them what to vote for. - The vote was called on by a selfish person thinking of their party over the country due to the rise of UKIP. - Those sat on the fence were so torn which way to vote because the information was so muddied, as with pressure from their families and the rift it caused. - It was at the height of the migrant crisis, which has nothing to do with Brexit but was used as ammunition making some people think freedom of movement, or the EU migrants can be put under the same umbrella. - The lies about EU migrants and how we don't need them and they don't contribute, when they do. Then we have major issues that are tied to the future of the outcome. - The ridiculous notion of 'democracy' and 'the will of the people' from a women who wasn't elected by the country, her _party_ was (unfortunately) who doesn't _listen_ to her own party. It is a one women show. That is _not_ democracy. Going against what those we voted in, her party, say. - Scotland had 6 in 10 vote to remain. - The Irish boarder was not discussed nearly as much as it should have been. - The fisherman was used as a baseline for arguments despite the fact they contribute to the economy on a tiny percentage. - Gibraltar is left in the wind and had little say in the matter. - Expats being thrown to the wolves. - Trade deals taking years to make and lowers our food standards and potentially paving ways for chlorinated chicken and hormonal beef. - Under every circumstance making the economy worse. - We lose massive amounts of security and intelligence - It potentially can cause the total destruction of the Union, as in, the united kingdom. - It has cost the country so much already, not just in money but in standards in almost every area from police to education due to Brexit being in the limelight. - It has caused a huge divide in the country, the worst in the modern era. - We will lose the backing of 27 other governments, a powerhouse that can't be pushed around. All that has a very real threat of destroying the united kingdom and leaving the countries to go their own way. Whatever your view is on brexit, either a remain or leave vote, I don't think anyone voted to make the country worse. There was a vote on just two things and nothing else. A vote to stay as we were, one of the richest countries in the world in the most prosperous trading bloc with the best human and animal rights in the world OR a vote for complete and utter uncertainty. This was all the vote was. A vote IS democratic, that is what democracy is. If we had a second referrendum, those very same people can vote again! (Unless, they died of course, so, should we honour their opinion when they don't have the consequences?). There is NOTHING stopping anyone from voting! It will be 30 minutes of their day to make sure this is what the country _really_ wants, compared to a lifetime of consequences. I say preventing a vote is undemocratic. Ignoring the will of the people today, is undemocratic. A PM doing her own thing against her parties wishes is undemocratic. To me, having some random person I'm never going to meet, get to vote me out of a union I have always appreciated and been proud to be apart of, with a vote I never wanted, from a party I've never wanted, is undemocratic. Lastly, using a referendum that ONLY had two choices, yes or no, with a 50%+1 outcome was dangerous, stupid, and reckless. A government is put in place to run the country, not run it to the ground. It is their responsibility to do what is best for the country and its people. Even if it was undemocratic if there was a good enough reason. To me, this seems like a good enough reason, but, I am only one person, entitled to my view as is everyone. ----- A question for you: James, a 40 year old male, was in court on trial for murder. James was a fairly prominent figure, many people had heard of him but didn't know too much about him, but most people had an opinion on the guy anyway. James put forth his case to the judge and jury. Like most people, the Jury had heard of James, some bad stories, and some good. His case was a very complicated situation. After the trial, the jury had been bickering, a lot didn't quite add up but the louder members had put forth their case. 5 of the twelve Juries claimed he was guilty, they couldn't put forth any evidence but the case to them, was a pretty much a given, he looked guilty, he just had to be. 4 of the Jury tried to dispute this, claiming a lot of it didn't quite add up. The other 5 however, didn't care, they had already made up their minds. The other 3 were completely on the fence, they could see both sides and thought there's a chance he could be guilty, but they also saw a lot of inconsistencies with the case and didn't want to automatically condemn the man. The trial went on for years, no one could reach a conclusion. The judge decided that he was guilty, he sentenced the man to death and his execution date was in 2 years. Over the coming years, more evidence came to light. It was looking more and more likely that James, was in fact innocent. 2 of the 3 undecided jury had changed their stance that he was now innocent. 2 of the 5 Juries that originally thought he was guilty, changed to innocent. 1 of the 4 Juries that said he was innocent, now claimed he was guilty. Now 7 of the twelve thought he was in fact innocent. Over the coming year, views kept flipping back and forth, but it at least seemed, those who thought he was innocent was gaining a much bigger traction. Even some of those who continued to state he was guilty, had doubts in their mind, but it didn't matter, they just didn't like the guy so the fact's didn't interest them. It was almost his execution date, suddenly an influx of evidence came to light, James was innocent. However, it didn't matter, the Judge had already sentenced him two years ago. It's too late now, he has to hang. After all, democracy is set in stone, and the democratic process that lead to his execution had already decided two years ago. James was a rich guy with a large family, he had actually funded many charities. He had used up a lot of his money on the trial, his inheritance, strangely enough will be going to the justice system but his death with have lasting effects and his family will suffer, and a lot of the charities will cease to exist. But who cares, people voted him guilty, it's just undemocratic if we were to go through another democratic process. It doesn't matter that all the Judges Aides are against the judges decision. The country had voted the Aides in, but not the Judge, the judge was put in place when the previous one quit. However, the democratic thing to do is let the judge do what she wants, against the wish of her aides, anything else would be completely undemocratic. Or is it? ----- Long read I know, but this whole farce has become ridiculous, and I am sick of being told what I think, when I and the vast majority of the people I know, despite being in a constituency who sadly voted leave, do not think or say this. - Edit, apparently, I've done something that increases the size of the text.
