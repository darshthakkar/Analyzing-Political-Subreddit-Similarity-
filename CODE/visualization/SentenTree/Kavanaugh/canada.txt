"of course they don't want to do this. they want someone who will follow their party line, even if that person taints the credibility of the supreme court for years to come. "
"well the republican members of the senate and kavanaugh himself basically threatened the democrats with exactly that, so i guess i have to concede as much. "
">guilty, but they're all partisan shitpuppets, democrats included. "
"is she too stupid to understand the difference? this lady sounds like an airhead. "
