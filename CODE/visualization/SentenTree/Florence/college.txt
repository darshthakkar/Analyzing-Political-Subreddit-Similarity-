"should i go home or stay at university in wake of florence?"
"i’m sure it’s possible (i also go to a school in the previous path of florence), but i highly, highly doubt any would, since the path of the hurricane can shift at any time. plus, many students have already evacuated campuses to their homes possibly hours away. it would me a major inconvenience to everyone imo "
"i’ve been out of school longer than i’ve been in school, thanks florence. "
