"> i don't think they said that. "
">you can argue which one has done more damage, but no one is free from blame. "
">what's even more disingenuous is trying to build some equivalence between the parties' faults. one party may not be pristine, but the other has completely lost it. "
"my post literally says: "
"op's post is literally one sentence blaming the republican party. there's not much subjectivity to infer this in any other way. "
"assume you somehow objectively prove it's 60% republicans' fault and 40% democrats. what did you accomplish? what is the net benefit to the country as a whole? "
"i made no equivalence between the two, i explicitly said you can argue which one is worse, but that there is no point in doing so. it doesn't matter which one is worse; that's a conversation about as useful as who to blame for hurricane florence. the reality of the situation is the reality of the situation, figuring out who deserves *more* blame does nothing to help us get back on the right track.
