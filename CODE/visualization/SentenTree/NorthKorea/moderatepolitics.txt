"> speaking on bbc news, the american professor argued diplomacy remains the best card to play for donald trump with north korea, after the american president cancelled the june 2018 summit with kim jong-un. "
"nice try, but no. iran is and has been actively funding terrorist groups across the world for decades, and that was not even a point of negotiation in the so called deal. at least our position with north korea hinges on denuclearization. obama got nothing meaningful from the iran deal but an empty promise.

"i certainly think that trump has put significant face towards making something real come out of the nk meeting(s), especially since he has already made concessions (suspending joint military exercises with sk) without having much to show for it. for a normal president, failure to follow though after that would be a huge loss of confidence, but since he is not held accountable for anything, the gop and his supporters likely wouldn't care. not sure his ego could take the hit, so he'd probably deflect/blame someone else for the problem. maybe canada. :-) "
