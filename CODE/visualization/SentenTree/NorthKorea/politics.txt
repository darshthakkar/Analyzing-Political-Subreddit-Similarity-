">as president trump names u.s. ambassador to the united nations john bolton his next national security advisor, npr uncovers a 2013 video bolton recorded for the right to bear arms, a russian gun rights group with close ties to the national rifle association and a connection to vladimir putin. the episode, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the common cause that russian and american gun rights groups were forming in the years leading up to the 2016 election through former national rifle association president david keene. keene appointed bolton to the nra's international affairs subcommittee in 2011. russian politician alexander torshin helped establish the right to bear arms and cultivate ties with american gun rights groups including the nra. as a putin ally, torshin served as the deputy speaker of russia's parliament for more than a decade, and also spent time on russia's national anti-terrorism committee, a state body that includes the director of russia's internal security service.

"the agreement for the denuclearization is to denuclearize the korean peninsula. that is- for both nk and sk to give up their nukes and for powers with nukes to withdraw their military presence from the territories. that would include the us. "
"so yeah... *the exact same goddamn thing*. i 'memba. "
"> -- 2002: us president george w. bush labels north korea, iran and iraq an 'axis of evil,' saying that 'by seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger.' the administration later reveals north korea admitted to operating a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of the 1994 deal. "
"mcconnell's comments come after trump and north korean leader kim jong un held a historic meeting in singapore. the two men  committing the united states to unspecified “security guarantees” in exchange for a denuclearized korean peninsula. "
"converting the 1953 korean armistice agreement into a peace treaty on the korean peninsula "
"translation of loophole argument: until the boss tells us directly, himself, in writing and verbally and smoke signal, we will continue to follow his previous orders to make nukes. --- kim never sends that message, and claims that his declaration at the summit should have been enough, thereby ensuring a circle of blame that allows them to bullshit the world with excuses. loophole fulfilled. "
"what success is that? "
"it’s also part of trump’s campaign plan to allow countries to foot some of the resources in protecting themselves at this point - meaning japan and south korea. we need to bleed less resources into the military and bring it back home. spend less. put the money back into the pockets of the citizenry. and if we have to fight or show force, do it smartly. "
"look at the links i posted in the prior message. "
"commitment to working towards denuclearization might as well say 'nk commits the thinking about the possibility of starting to maybe get rid of some of it's nukes.' the big word that's missing from the statement is 'inspections'. it would have been great if the statement said 'nk is committed to denuclearization and adherence to an inspection regime to be determined in the future.' there is nothing tangibly new here, the ball hasn't been moved forward, other than the legitimacy un just got from meeting with the us president as an equal. nk position today isn't any different than it was yesterday. our position has changed in that we're willing to stop joint exercises with sk. so we've made a new concession and nk has not. "
">opposing trump doesn't have to mean opposing every single thing he does. it's okay to admit he can get it right once in a while, and still oppose him. no politician is 100% good or 100% bad. let's keep some perspective here. "

"there's a yuuge unfinished one in pyongyang that i could easily imagine trump slapping his name on:  "
"nk gains: "
"sanctions weren't working great, but until trump, their strategy of nuclear development was working even worse, resulting in increasing isolation. but now, it turned out to be a very viable strategy! develop nukes, icbms, and you get to hang out with the pres! get invited to the white house, get all kinds of glamorous treatment. all you need to do is say you'll lower the gun you built, loaded, and pointed at the world. "
"*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please  if you have any questions or concerns.* "
"north korea has nothing to lose here, while the trump administration has positioned themselves to potentially look quite foolish. they are desperate for a foreign policy win and their constant hype about a nobel peace prize and trump’s “masterful” negotiation skills will be mocked if he can’t secure denuclearization without massive concessions.
